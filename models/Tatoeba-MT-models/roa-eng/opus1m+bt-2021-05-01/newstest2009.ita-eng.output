The Prague Stock Exchange at the close of the market had a negative collapse.
After the morning collapse, the Prague Stock Exchange restored the losses.
The transactions of the CEZ shares have reached almost half of the current daily trade.
Since the beginning of Tuesday, the Prague Stock Exchange has recovered from the fall of the day before it was almost 6%.
Behind this fall is the collapse of actions on Wall Street.
So, also from us, there is a reaction from the market to the outcome of the vote of the House of Representatives in America, which refused to support the stabilisation plan of the local financial sector.
Action Collapsed in Asia
On Tuesday the actions of the Asian Stock Exchanges experienced a dramatic collapse, although the indices, however, during the day later deleted some of the losses.
The Hang Seng Index of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange during the day cancelled almost 4%, but then also a part of the losses stabilized to 2.5%.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which follows the Chinese stock movement at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, fell by 3.8% while the markets were closed in Shanghai.
The stock at the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than 5%, but in the end the losses were at 4.3%.
The Thay-Wan Stock Exchange, according to the local index, fell by 3.6%.
\"The planning of the rescue action is uncertain and this will influence the financial markets all over the world,\" observed Hong Kong Joseph Yam's Head of the Currency Office.
Hong Kong, despite being part of China, manages its financial policy on its own, so it does not depend on the Central Bank.
Hong Kong has interest rates at the same level as the United States.
American legislators, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Ruddd, should quickly return to dialogue and approve the proposed financial support.
Otherwise there is a risk that other countries will suffer from the consequences.
Shooting of American actions
The American Parliament Monday rejected the financial system support plan, for which 700 billion dollars (almost twelve billion Czech krona) were to be allocated.
The legislators have thus ignored President Bush's call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
The U.S. shares on Monday experienced a draw and the main indexes of the shares have recorded the biggest collapse since more than twenty years.
The Dow Jones Index dropped by almost 7% and a similar collapse occurred last time in 1987.
The index was already lowered before the vote, but as soon as it became clear that the bill was not approved, it fell free.
Congress has yielded: the U.S. government can extend 700 billion dollars to banks.
The highest representatives of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of an understanding of economic support for the American financial system.
The vote will begin next week.
American legislators broke the ice in the dialogue on the approval of the rescue plan in the form of economic aid for the American financial system for a total of 700 million dollars (almost twelve billion crowns).
But it's not known yet.
The representatives of Congress, therefore, must define some details of the understanding before they publish the definitive form of the law and vote on it.
The financial system support plan will be discussed Monday on the territory of the House of Representatives.
On Sunday he said this to Reuters agency, the chairman of the Banking and Financial Services Committee of the Barney Frank room.
In the Senate, according to some sources, one could vote on the plan probably not before Monday.
According to the economies, the announcement that the financial plan will be approved should be the first and fundamental psychological factor able to awaken the financial markets.
Next, however, there will be a return to reality because of the complexity of the mechanisms with which, in practice, the aid of the markets will be achieved.
Paulson: The Plan must be effective
\"We've taken a big step forward\"
\"We have clarified our differing views on the form of the presentation of the package for market stabilization,\" democratic Nancy Pelosi said to the Bloomberg agency.
According to the same opinion , the final vote could still take place on Sunday.
The legislators gathered the night between Saturday and Sunday with American finance minister Henry Paulson, to give final form to the government's financial funds.
These funds should serve to acquire from financial companies non-cedible mortgage assets, which lead financial firms to serious losses and endanger the stability of the whole system.
\"We are in compliance with the final agreement of the plan that will work and that must also be effective on the market\"
\"It's necessary to carry on the plan of rehabilitation, but I think we are,\" Paulson said.
The Asian Trade Signal
The global financial crisis falls heavily on the markets for shares that are falling sharply.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, legislators are trying to reach a final agreement at Congress even before Sunday.
In other words, they want to calm investors before trade in Asian financial markets, which are, in order of time, the first to influence the market on Monday following the decision of the Congress.
But for now it is not clear when the two Houses of the American Congress will vote the law and even if negotiations can be stopped at the last moment on some problems.
The legislators hope that it will be approved in the next few days.
But the law will still undergo many changes.
The total amount planned for system support must be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion must be available as soon as possible as President George Bush asked.
But Congress can block the allocation of the rest of the sum in case it will have the impression that the program does not perform its function, blocking the next $100 billion and after the end 350.
Bush appreciated the progress in negotiations.
Although the President may veto this decision, the Congress may, however, overrule its right of veto.
Despite these changes, the basic thought of the program has remained, i.e. to obtain the finances to buy passive mortgage values, whose price has collapsed due to hundreds of thousands of Americans who are unable to pay their mortgages.
We've worked it all out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the Sunday Law and the Senate Monday, as the Republican senator mentioned.
Progress in negotiations is also welcomed by American President Bush.
His spokesman Tony Fratto stated that Bush is satisfied with the positive course of Saturday and appreciates - the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy -
Restrictions on gold parachutes
The President of the Banking Committee of Senator Christopher Dodd, the main spokesperson, said that the legislators agreed on the responsibility of the financial programme, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the closure of the budget of reductions, the split of the financial plan.
The new law must also limit so-called gold parachutes for managers of the companies participating in the programme and is creating a committee that will control the funds.
These should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
\"We have worked very hard and we have made a great step forward towards the agreement that will work and will be useful for the market and also for all Americans,\" Paulson said.
The plan counts on the help to the owners of the houses that have problems with payments.
The government should negotiate the new mortgage rates which it will buy with the aim of lowering monthly charges for debtors and will allow it to keep their homes.
Marek: psychological support
The proposed plan is, according to the main economy of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea but its realization will be very difficult.
And that's why we don't know how and for what price problem assets will be bought
This will be decisive as to how the financial sector and the government will split the losses between them, - said Marek this week for the iHNed.cz website.
Whether the plan will be approved now or at the beginning of the next week is not, according to Marek, so fundamental.
The most important thing is that Congress representatives have already reached agreement this week on the support of this plan and that they will baptize it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of this agreement that will be approved is at this most important moment, -he stressed Marek.
Duel to the last blood: MP3 players versus cell phones
We'll recommend how to choose
While almost every cell phone can read MP3 files, no MP3 player can phone.
From this it is clear that it is better to buy only the phone.
Despite this, there are many reasons why an autonomous reader should be obtained.
The choice depends entirely on the way of use and the needs of the future owner.
Perhaps you hardly understood a expensive high quality turntable to listen to the latest album by Maxim Turbulenc.
First of all these musical products do not come out as LP and from a qualitative point of view for this there is no objective reason.
If, however, on your shelves, there are vinyls of hard-rock, jazz or blues, a turntable of the kind as little as you dream of.
It also works with portable music, that is compressed music or simply in MP3 format.
Here too are the price and quality categories.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend for an 8 thousand crown reader, as well as a Pink Floyd fan may hardly digest headphones from twenty crowns of the market.
Two extremes between which there is enough room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
It is the duration of the batteries to be decided.
Some high-quality music players can do much more than just read music, but they don't even do it by mistake.
There is no other current device as universal as the cell phone.
Next to primary functions, call and send sms, can read music and videos, record both and have a camera, sometimes better at times worse and may also navigate.
And if we consider smartphones and palm trees you will also have a miniature computer in your pocket.
It’s a small miracle because no refrigerator can make the grill and no TV can photograph anything.
The universality of the cell phone also brings disadvantages.
More functions you use on your cell phone and first the on-screen indicator will require the battery charger.
And reading music consumes a lot of energy.
Few cell phones can read music for more than twelve hours, only, and much less.
In this sense music readers (especially the simplest ones) are much more effective.
As far as economic phones are concerned, they do not count that they can last for more than a few hours.
If you still add, from time to time, some calls, get yourself to work for safety another charger, this also applies to the most expensive appliances.
But you will not have this problem with an MP3 player, even the worst last at least 9 hours with continuous functionality with a charging.
A further problem exists when you download the music into your cell phone.
Unfortunately only a limited part of devices has the universal USB port and not all of them can be connected to the computer without special software.
Of course music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only few memory readers are able to make it without adapter for minicards that are not used in mobile phones.
Readers, except for some exceptions (Ipod) do not need any special software.
Just fill the device with music via USB from the computer.
Most mobile phones and readers create themselves a multimedia library arranged according to the names of the performers, the name of the album, genre or according to the classification of the user.
Some devices only reproduce the folder tree structure, similar to the Explorer tool in Windows, and some know how to do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Corwon, smart phones with operating system).
Readers are easier to handle, mobile phones can do more.
When you choose a particular device, you are especially interested in the resistance of the battery, memory capacity, quality and type of audio output and clearly of ease of use.
If the music is used mainly as a background and if you listen to it every day only briefly on the tram there is only one cell phone that reads MP3.
This now succeeds, clearly in any cell phone.
You don't have to take too much care of what cell phone or reader formats they recognize.
MP3 players support them all, the overall majority of the music coming to you will be in this format.
In addition to this format that belongs to the most common ones, most devices support music in WMA format.
Less AAC is found (format used by Apple company and its Ipods).
The best mobile phones also allow, for example, to buy music online.
Just visit, through the mobile internet, the corresponding pages of the operator (or another supplier) and buy the song or album.
This same service could already be a valid topic to purchase a mobile phone-reader.
Unfortunately the offer of the operators is poor and usually is limited only to the hit of the moment of the radio.
Prices are not very low.
But it is generally assumed that this mode of selling music (either via GSM, internet or wireless internet) in the future will dominate the music industry.
Most people always wear their cell phone behind them.
Anyone wants to listen to something rust in the pocket while the MP3 player remains forgotten at home.
But it also depends on this, if you always carry behind the headphones or at least the headphone without wires.
If not, you can use the built-in player that almost every cell phone, but only a small part of MP3 players, ha.
Perhaps the biggest advantage of mobile readers will be, for many, the price.
The most economical ones normally cost less than 3 thousand crowns.
For 3 and 4 thousand crowns you will already buy a very dignified walkman.
Usually, however, you will be limited by the absence of an entrance for the common headphones.
The best mobile phones and from a technical point of view more equipped and also with a 3.5 mm socket for common headphones, cost up to 15 thousand crowns.
Instead the advantage of readers is, besides others, easy handling.
The simplest not necessarily more economical (see our choice) really makes us anyone to handle them.
The minimum of functions, the similarity of handleability once with the common stereo or perhaps the turntable, is obvious.
There is no danger of mishaping the start of the mobile internet network and as a result of a giant data transmission bubble.
What equipment to take
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable memory cards (of type M2, microSD etc.).
As far as the purchase of the card is concerned, it is included in the 2,000 crowns.
But be careful.
The base models only support cards with the maximum capacity of 2GB.
Only the most expensive ones do it with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take Corwon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
According to capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not have to spend more than 1 100 crowns.
If you're one of the most demanding listeners you'd prefer to take specialized mobile phones - walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have individual keys for MP3 and the convenience of the service thus approaches the same MP3 player.
In this area it has made more streets Sony Ericsson, which cell phones of the walkman line have the same scale of use as MP3 players sold separately.
The MP3 players of the above brands assure you the same service and the same price category up to 4 000 crowns, but with a larger memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery resistance (commonly 15 hours, in a maximum line up to 35 hours).
The first virtual operator will reach the Czech Republic already this year.
Maybe
Perhaps the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic is mature enough and our operators offer virtually all services as their partners in Western Europe.
There is still something missing - a virtual operator that requires traditional ones to lower the price.
Maybe it won't be long.
The fact that the Czech operators belong to the most expensive in Europe we have already written many times on Mobil.cz.
In the end, he also confirmed ČTU, which pointed out that the price of SMS is higher to us than in the rest of the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of roaming tariff regulation, perhaps a paradoxical situation will be created - for some customers of blind mobile operators the SMS will cost less from abroad than at home.
How can prices in the Czech Republic remain so high vis-à-vis Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that would really like to start the fight.
It may sound absurd, as well as here we have three mobile networks and cover well above 100 %.
On the other hand, the operators of the mobile telophony like to boast that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this sense, it also often emphasizes the head of the Czech Telecommunications Council (ČTU) , Pavel Dvořák, who in the past has expressed that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is perhaps true that the traditional operator with its own network no longer probably has many possibilities. (Of course, it would be difficult to find other frequencies now).
But there's still another possibility - the virtual operator.
The entry into the market of virtual operators has led to a significant fall in prices, to which traditional operators should have reacted.
At the same time before the entry of sharks such as Tesko Mobile and Virgin Mobile into the market, there were similar voices like us in Britain.
But it has been shown that the place for such operators is there and that they can really succeed.
In the end, we must not go too far for examples.
In February this year we informed you of the arrival of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In only half a year, this operator managed to conquer more than 100 thousand customers and become the fifth largest local operator.
At the same time behind Mobilking is the financial group Penta to which the Czech Republic belongs, among other things, U:fon.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility of focusing on a much more concrete group-best.
In order to be able to function effectively, it is enough for them to be much less customer than for a traditional operator.
They do not lead behind, i.e. relatively high costs for the creation, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
So in the world virtual operators usually come at low cost, they offer calls and SMS at little price, which is often in balance with the offer of the most limited services
For example, Tesco Mobile in Great Britain offers SMS that cost as little as half as its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can be quite a good move, too, to bet on a small group-bestage.
This operator aims to say specifically about men.
“The real men choose Mobilking operator that they like and can trust,” says David Seibertz CEO Mobile Entertainment Company that produces this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether we can affirm a similar concept as in Poland.
The press spokesperson for Vodafone Miroslav Čepický doubts this: -The Czech market is relatively small for a fragmented approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition from the point of view of services it is relatively saturated -
In the Czech Republic, there are no possibilities, mobile operators say
But it seems almost certain that if there ever will be an operator in the Czech Republic it will not be Mobilking.
“We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic negotiations do not have many expectations.
The ignition of Mobilking will take place rather in the other countries of our area, - he said in a telephone dialogue for Mobile.cz Jana Studničková, the press spokesman for the Penta financial group.
It thus indirectly confirmed that the present operators in the Czech Republic are not quite in favour of this.
Rather, they try to do everything because they do not create any competing potential.
For some time it has not hidden its interest for the start of a virtual operator, the GTS Novera group that would like to take another step to become a real competitor of Telefonika O2 in the business customer field.
We have a great interest in being able to offer our customers not only fixed services but also mobile telecommunications.
And it's better before.
We have repeatedly negotiated this possibility with all the blind operators of the mobile network.
We have already made progress in negotiations with some of them, says the spokesman for the Pavel Kaidl Group.
So maybe better times will come.
The unofficial information shows that the first virtual operator will probably have it by the end of the year.
But for now around his creation there is an impenetrable wall of silence.
\"At the moment we do not believe that in the Czech market there is room for the creation of a full virtual operator.
The Czech market, unlike other markets, is very specific.
So far no subject with a complex and serious project has addressed us, - mentioned in his statement for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sršeň of the press section of Telephonnika O2.
The specificities of the Czech market also apply to other operators.
T-Mobil Martina Kemrová’s press spokesman adds in a rare agreement with the declaration O2: “For now we have not noticed any vital and beneficial commercial project for both, on which it is possible to continue to build”
And he adds: “In the T-Mobile network, a virtual operator will hardly appear by the end of the year.
At the moment we have already had to have a concrete agreement on the table, so that it could be considered at the horizon -
Vodafone focuses its attention rather than reaching its own requests under the 3G licence.
Add Miroslav Čepický : -We are open to negotiations of potential virtual operators, and this is especially in the context of the sharing of expenditure and infrastructure.
Let us consider this, from the point of view of the customers, the most productive.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a common network for fast mobile internet -
The competent authorities - with the complicit operators
The attitude of mobile operators can easily be understood, the entry of another operator would mean increased competition, would lead to lower prices and thus to a decrease in profit.
Why, then, facilitate the rise of such a competitor?
The discomforts around the creation U:fon testify that when operators tend to something they can row from the same side.
Perhaps the great pressure against ČTU in the period of creation of U:fon towards the company of T-Mobile.
This testifies to the public access information from ČTU websites.
But now just U:fon serves as a topic for which not to accept the virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová observed: \"The environment of mobile telephone market competition has been little further enhanced by the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
With regard to the type of mobile market in the Czech Republic it is obvious that the entry of another competitor would put on him and above all on his high-pretense services -
However, from the attitude of mobile operators it is quite surprising that the Czech regulatory bodies are completely disinterested.
It is not just the attitude of the ČTU that unfortunately in the Czech Republic - unlike Britain and other developed countries - has no competence to interfere in economic competition.
That belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS).
This, however, has taken its typical position in relation to all the problems.
The entry of the virtual operator into the mobile phone market would be possible after the conclusion of the contract for the rental of the necessary infrastructure between mobile operator and virtual operator has been completed.
No such contracts have been concluded so far because the offer of potential buyers has probably not been quite interesting for traditional operators, - said Kristián Chalupa, from the section for external relations ÚOHS, in response to our question.
Such a statement by the representatives of the operators may not surprise us.
On the other hand, the office which must defend the interests of consumers and above all to deal with the fact that no one takes advantage of its position on the market is more than a delicate deal.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: “Outside where virtual operators commonly operate, we can observe that their entry into the market has contributed to lower prices for mobile telephone services”
But, of course, the pressure on the correct functioning of the market environment and the lowering of prices do not belong to the interests of UIOHS.
Really shocking in the whole situation is the almost exciting harmony of these three operators resulting from their reactions.
The question of whether this is really just a coincidence is on its own.
The same as the same price of gasoline for all gas stations is certainly the result of coincidence and competitive struggle.
The section found no evidence of anti-competitive behaviour on this issue and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
No operator has a dominant position, so it has no greater responsibility for its behaviour on the market.
The necessary tools for the opening up of the mobile network market for virtual operators may also be missing from the telecom regulator, - said Chalupa in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many controversial points .
Of course there is the analysis of the relevant markets developed by ČTú, according to which telecommunications is from the point of view of economic competition the only market.
On such a market, of course, no Czech operator has a dominant position.
But some legal experts offer another approach - for the creation of a virtual operator is always necessary the agreement of the network operator.
And the mobile operator has - in the end of the accounts logically - the monopoly of its network.
So for a certain portion it must be dominant by force.
But even if we do not admit this argument, for UOHS it should be a minimum alert that three mobile operators do so strangely similar.
At the same time, complaints from stakeholders (including the mentioned GTS Novera company) show that during negotiations with all operators encounter very similar obstacles.
Downloading responsibility to ČTU in telecommunications is a fairly frequent trick with which ÚOHS is kept out of the whole matter.
We have already found this in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to promote the expansion of ČTU's rights in the field of economic competition in telecommunications until the recently approved telecommunications law was updated, despite the fact that many experts were expecting improvement in the situation from this point of view.
This fact the representatives of UOHS must know more than well, but perhaps their interests are elsewhere.
You can do it when no one looks.
While we are not aware of this, there is still the functioning of such pseudo-virtual operators, of which there are even some in the Czech mobile networks.
These companies publish their mobile phone services price lists but are only partially public.
These are usually companies that deal with multilevel marketing.
So for example Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a number of others offer their mobile phone services.
The price lists of these companies usually reach only pre-determined people.
The magic lies in the fact that the company towards the operator appears as a classic company customer, which orders a large amount of SIM card.
As an important customer then receives special price offers (and more).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such a pre-sale.
\"If the cases you are talking about, which we will be interested in, could be a breach of contractual conditions, and could result in the conclusion of cooperation with that company,\" answered Martina Kemrová.
But it is quite unlikely that such an activity would reach the ears of the actors responsible for mobile operators.
Especially in the case of the three companies mentioned, there can be thousands of customers.
No operator defends himself at the same time from such an attitude.
From the activity of these companies they bring a non-indifferent profit and at the same time - unlike the real virtual operators - they are not damaged in any way with their official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns about possible problems:-The law allows similar speculations, however only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
They must also accept that the SIM card in their phone is not registered on their behalf, so they cannot have full of it as the regular customers of mobile operators -
But this should be a little strange at the ČTU.
There is also another question for UOHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes in the face of such an attitude, why do they block the creation of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that ÚOHS has strong enough rights to expose similar activities and if he does not want to be satisfied with the explanation of the operators who have no idea of all this and that their commercial conditions prohibit it.
When we're no longer expensive
As has already been mentioned several times in the text, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile phone market has led to a significant lowering of prices for services.
At the same time, in virtually all the countries where operators were born, traditional operators tried more or less to prevent their creation.
The arguments they used were practically identical - too small market, too saturated limit, problems with quality of services etc.
But in the countries developed precisely in these cases, the regulatory bodies in defence did not intervene by mobile operators but by their customers.
Both with the formal measures and with the non-formal pressure, then it came to the creation of the first virtual operator and to him there were others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulator organs are launched from one to the other all of the same as a boiling potato.
For our experience we cannot get rid of the feeling that the lack of clarity of skills in these cases makes him more than comfortable.
But we don't throw the sponge.
If the backstage information is correct and the virtual operator will appear very soon from us, the Czech mobile phone market will return to the motorcycle.
If one of the operators had consented to the creation of a virtual mobile operator only hardly ÚOHS could remain unfavourable to the refusal (discrimination) of the others concerned.
And we may stop calling at higher prices than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four new versions of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday the premier Mirek Topolánek on the occasion of the day of recognition of the Czech State presented in a solemn manner the new recordings of the national anthem -Kde domov mŭj -
The new recording of the anthem was made by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - solo with male or female voice, choir step and instrumental edition.
The song is under the direction of Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the revisions of the anthem are Otakar Jeremiaáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz site you can listen to all four versions.
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national song one of the most beautiful hymns.
He has already said to the radio \"Český rozhlas\" that he has chosen specifically to sing the variants alone, the singers with the most representative young voices, which are expressive and popular.
\"From the beginning I tried to take care that both and also the choir, have the clear statement, that the text is well understandable, that they are in harmony,\" he said.
Then the national anthem will celebrate the next year the 175th anniversary.
The song “Kde domov mŭj” was played for the first time in 1834 on the stage of Stavovskéh divadlo in the original work Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl accompanied by the music of František Škroupa.
He bought popularity and people spontaneously made it his own.
The first stanza of the song after the founding of Czechoslovakia in 1918 became the natural part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the birth of the autonomous Czech Republic.
How the New Inno sounds
The Wednesday MHD in Prague will also accompany you for the first time with an electronic card
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be written in the history of the Prague Transportation Company as the date when the metro, tram and bus will climb the first passengers who will have an electronic card in the pocket instead of the paper ticket.
At the moment, you can get about 100,000 people who own your Opencard card.
Passengers can buy the one for 30 and 90 days annually (which will take place from the first January 2009) and at the same time have their paper recharged in the Infopoints and the offices of the Transport Company and the metro station Muzeum, Mýstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
The coupons can already be purchased from the Internet on the page of the Transportation Company www.dpp.cz.
More than four hundred customers have taken advantage of the service before the afternoon.
Those who will start using the internet service can completely forget the doors at the subway stops where they had to make long files for paper tickets so far.
The cutting is purchased via the internet and on the Opencard it is recharged on one of the twelve branches of the Municipal Library.
\"In these places passengers have a door with trained staff who will help those interested in buying on the internet and will also record on their card the credit they have acquired,\" said the spokesman for the Martin Oporný project.
In addition to libraries, it will be possible to load the electronic coupons on the Opencards in ATMs and selfservices that are installed at the entrances of the meter.
How are these ATMs?
They are red, similar to the ticket obliterators and the passengers have already noticed them at the stops of the metro Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
\"There are five of them throughout the city, but by the end of the year there should be eighty of them,\" Opatrný concluded.
The cutting will be controlled instead of by the driver from the ATM.
The ATM service that will work tomorrow is very simple.
Just insert the Opencard card and before payment of the cutting, you will load it on top.
Electronic cards apply from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is in the urban lines of trains and buses from the number 300 to 499, which the inhabitants of the municipalities of Central Bohemia take to reach the capital.
‘In the trains added to the integrated transports of Prague there are the controllers equipped with readers of the cards with which they verify the temporal and zonal validity,’ explained the mode of control of the Filip tickets by the Ropid organization, which sets up the hours of the collective transports of Prague.
Urban buses have card readers integrated into the driver’s case.
During the ascent it is therefore necessary not only to show the magnetic paper to the driver, but also to support the Opencard at the specific point next to the case.
So the driver checks the validity of the charged coupons.
‘If the passenger needs to check the validity of the loaded coupons, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this type of information,’ Drápal added.
Passengers who take the urban buses and will not remember, when the validity of the cutting goes down, can once again go to the self-service ATMs, where the coupons are loaded on the paper.
Here you will see the information about the validity of their documents on the device screen.
The Germans of the South wanted a referendum from the USA
The Germans of the South in 1945 asked to include Šumava in the United States.
This results from the letter deposited in the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live under at least the patronage of the united states.
With this desire, according to what is said, certain groups of Germans from the South have turned to the president of the United States in 1945.
This results in more than just the letter stored in a private archive and today deposited in the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
The Germans of Český Krumlov ask in the letter to the American President not to allow again the return of the Šumava district - occupied by Hitler on the basis of the Munich-Cecoslovak agreement.
\"We understand the situation and we want to be sure of the promises for American units to arrive in German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators, \"it is written in the letter signed with the words \"People who hold to the destiny of Šumava with all their heart\"
Since, they say, the annexation to Czechoslovakia - knowing the Czech national character - gives the Germans of the Southeast only hope for brutality, lack of respect, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter pray the American president to assume the protégé on Šumava now and ever.
\"We cannot believe that without regard for the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants, you will recognize this territory as a state to us outside, which oppresses and eradicates ethnic minorities and has not contributed at all to the victory of the Allies, \"it is written in the letter.
The reason why the authors cannot sign it is the alleged fear of the revenge thirst by the \"blind oppressors\"
If the President of the United States were to doubt the German belief in Šumava, it would be sufficient to organize a referendum in the district on the will of its inhabitants to become part of the USA or to live under the rule of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may seem naive with our knowledge of the post-war history, according to some witnesses it accurately describes the expectations of the Germans of the South.
Although the Czech Germans had to minimally understand that it would have been their move from the republic, only a few of them fully allowed such a possibility.
Some expected the United States and Great Britain to negotiate a sort of autonomy for the peoples of the South.
Others believed that they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
He was mobilized during the war as a German Budějovice in the maritime power of the Baltic Sea.
When at the end of the war he was captured by the British and put in the prison camp in Holštýn, the tens of other Czech Germans went to find him for him to teach him the Czech.
\"These people thought that once they returned home the Czech would make him comfortable,\" said Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners, lived in Czechoslovakia's lead of the war, said he was counting on the fact that on the basis of Beneš' decrees they would be moved from the Republic.
Don't think you're gonna pay!
The emotional campaign will attack the drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
It could also be defined as the emotional media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
The office of Minister Aleš Æebíček, it is expected that this discourages drivers from dangerous driving behavior.
The 150 million campaign will appear on television, radio, cinema, internet but also on flyers.
It should discourage drivers from driving fast and alcohol to the steering wheel.
And remind him to put his belt on before he leaves.
He wants to touch in his consciousness especially young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and not lastly professional drivers.
What's going to appear on the spot?
Especially the stories of people who will affect emotions.
And this also testifies to the slogan \"bloody\" of the entire campaign:
Don't think you're gonna pay!
The word \"don't think\" is written capital on the plate.
And in a blood well there's the word \"you'll pay\"
This must symbolize that a person can in a moment of distraction pay with his or her life.
Spots will scare viewers until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where images can commonly be seen with dramatic scenes of victims of accidents.
It promises to lower the number of accidents and deaths on the Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Carrot and guide stick
The carrot and stick system works with the drivers.
The carrot for them is for example when they pass with red and so save time.
The stick is the danger of fine or accident.
We need to remember the risk to the drivers, says the psychologist of the Martin Kořán Ministry of Transport of the hospital Na Homolce.
And so they want information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative advertising, the psychologist believes.
According to him, the panels that warn the drivers of danger are already less effective.
‘If the fixed panel has been installed warning of the danger, it will probably soon be confused with the environment and the drivers will not pay more attention to it,’ warns Kořán.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
The Prime Minister of the Israeli Interim Government Ehud Olmert expressed himself for the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, namely also the borders of Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan heights, in exchange for peace between Palestinians and Syrians.
So he said in the dialogue that he published Monday, the daily Jediot Achronot.
\"We have to come to an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that almost all areas (occupied) will have to be returned, if not all,,\" Olmert said to the daily newspaper.
We will have a certain percentage of these territories, but the Palestinians will have to leave the same percentage (of the Israeli areas), because without this there will be no peace, he added.
He admitted that the possible return will also include East Jerusalem.
\"He who wants security in Jerusalem and above all does not want the raiders or the spies to pass on it, as has happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up a part of Jerusalem,\" Olmert noted in the light of the two July attacks in the city, during which some people were killed and dozens of people injured.
According to the premier it will be necessary to find a special solution for the Temple Mountain, the sacred and historical places, which are inside the Old City. .
\"He who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270 000 Arabs.
This will not work, - he also stressed.
The withdrawal from the heights of Golan
Olmert also said that Israel would be removed from Golan's height, that is, that is to say, the essential condition for concluding this peaceful agreement with Syria.
But this would also require some effort from Damascus.
\"I do not propose the conclusion of peace with Syria solely on the basis of the withdrawal from Golan,\" he warned.
The Syrians know well what they will have to give up in order to get the heights of Golan.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with the Hezbollahs (Sciite Movement); they will have to give up their permanent support, which they offer to Hamas’ terrorism, Al-Qaida’s (Terrorist Network) and Jihad (Holy War) in Iraq, specified the premier.
Questions after the accident: Are the stewards illegal in the buses?
The law does not recognize them, you cannot walk on the bus that takes long distances
In the context of the tragic incident near the Italian city of Padua the coach of Student Agency company came out the question if the stewards and passengers can move on board the bus during the race.
\"If we want to comply with the laws severely and formally, the work of the steward is in conflict with the law of road traffic,\" says the spokesman for the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
Last week’s incident with which a 22-year-old hostess died was caused by a truck that cut the road to the bus.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver on the less secure spot of the coach, despite the fact that there were still two other seats assigned.
But the bus can do an accident or stop sharply even at the time of distribution of coffee or newspapers.
It depends on whether or not the bus is equipped with standings according to the circulation booklet.
If the passengers are not approved, they must be seated.
Student Agency buses have no standing places, confirmed it at Aktuáln .cz website the director of Radim Jančura.
We evaluated this with the Ministry and initially did not allow the passenger movement on the bus.
After it was revoked and we concluded that passengers can use the bathroom during the race if they have the place assigned, - expressed their point of view.
The law doesn't recognize the steward.
\"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of steward\" \"no law deals with the regularization of this role\"
However, no regulation prohibits the carrier from performing the services.
The Road Traffic Act recognizes only the accompanying term of the vehicle, its rights and duties are not defined, - it adds less clearly the spokesperson Hanzelka.
The director of the Department of Road Traffic of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorný believes, that the law cures this problem enough.
It depends on whether the bus has approved seats.
That's all, he says.
Categorize the buses in urban areas where there are the standings and the maximum limited speed, interurbans with standings with highest and long-traffic speed without the standings with the maximum speed allowed and seats equipped with safety belts.
As in the air, the expert says.
The expert BESIP on road safety Jaroslav Hořín does not find the background problem in the Steward movement on board the bus.
During a quiet race there are not many dangers, the situation can be compared to the service on the planes.
It’s not even safe there when a turbulence comes and the flight attendant can knock his head off —
‘If the bus does a sudden braking, obviously the laws of physics are valid.
Just like in the city bus or tram.
The carrier must resolve the security of the stewards with an internal regulation, - it also says and intends that, from the point of view of the law, the problem is not solved.
Jančura is willing to suspend services.
Student Agency is the only transport company that offers the services of the stewards..
It takes about two hundred.
Not even after the accident does the director consider their trade dangerous.
\"As soon as I have a feeling of having to consider the steward's profession as a dangerous job, I will abolish it.
Passengers can receive coffee and newspapers as they leave.
They would also reduce expenses, he says.
The director of Asiana Alexej Litvin, who manages a fraction of lines compared to Student Agency, has motivated the absence of stewards on his means as an interest in security.
\"We have no hostess, we are already opposed from the beginning.
Before or after it will end with a fatal accident, he said less than a year ago Týden.cz.
There is an immense tragedy.
In the incident of the line for Naples, a young hostess from the Plzeň region died, who had worked for the company for two years.
A Slovenian truck probably got out of the emergency lane without using the arrow and blocked the road to the bus.
The bus driver tried to avoid him with a sudden maneuver, but hit him with the front right.
Jančura rejects the fact that the two seats reserved for the rest of the Stewarts had been occupied.
\"It is not possible to reserve these seats in the long-distance buses, they are incessible\"
The company intends to denounce the driver of the truck.
The agency will not wait for the Court’s judgment to pay the damage to the girl’s family, but it is expected a financial compensation from the offender.
The law review?
Not in view
The review of the law, on which a group of 30 experts from the Ministry of Transport for more than a year, has worked, could lead to clarify the movement of the Stewarts on board buses.
\"But they have not achieved any concrete results.
They do not consider them so much the buses, they deal more with the system at high speed on the highway and use of the mobile during driving, says expert Hořín.
‘The Ministry of Transport does not consider the work of the Stewarts as a major threat to passenger safety,’ concludes Mr Havelka, that the control of bus safety is the responsibility of the police and security offices.
Düsseldorf’s hopes point to Frankfurt
There is no lack of words in the letter from the Director of the WestLB addressed to the employees of the house.
In the letter published on Monday that could be formed - the capital market centre of the financial group of savings banks - through the meeting of units of the bank institution of Düsseldorf with the deka-Bank of Frankfurt.
West LB would launch a competent block with lasting profits in such an undertaking.
Furthermore, all such a union could be a decisive boost to further links in the Länder banking sector.
Thus it is read, when a board of directors in difficult times wants to demonstrate the capacity of action.
As WestLB is still under heavy pressure.
Not only on the part of the EU Commission, but also through the National System for Financial Supervision, having pointed out time ago to the regional government of North Rhine-Westphalia that time tightens in search of a future solution.
Of the ties between the Deka-Bank, that the same customers of the Savings Fund because of their investment funds already know, and the WestLB has certainly been talking about it for a while, even by Frankfurt.
He reported to the end of August the head of the Deka-Bank Franz Waas at the time of the presentation of the turnover of the first half of the year that a merger of the house with a national bank such as Helaba or West LB makes no sense.
However, the board of directors of the Deka, which for half is brought by the regional banks and the consortia of the savings banks, has delegated the board of directors to conduct discussions with the West LB on joint contracts.
This could be market negotiations or parts of them.
The talks, however, have, as they say in the business square, just begun.
Della Deka-Bank, with its 3000 employees, is one of those that counts most in the business square in Frankfurt, it is not mentioned the first time when it comes to consolidating the sector of savings banks.
In 2003 for a short period it seemed that the Deka-Bank could merge with the regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate and Helaba.
There was nothing done about this three-way association.
As soon as the projects were published, the regional bank of Asia was opposed to the participation of Helaba.
The remaining two institutions have also proved unable to reach an agreement.
The regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate went instead to the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
Yet we have always been thought about a merger of the Deka-Bank with regional banks.
But in the end Günther Merl, president of the Helaba Board of Directors, expressed himself against design games to meet with his home.
Apart from this, it seems that knowledge is created, that it is necessary to approach the different homes in the public sector.
Since the election of the Bavarian Parliament has passed, a meeting of the Bavarian Landesbank with that of Baden-Württemberg could be held first.
For Helaba it's not a good news at all.
If it increases the pressure for other mergers, the partners will be missing as soon as possible.
In the South now there would be the junior partner, although so far it has overcome the financial crisis much better than the houses in Monaco and Stuttgart.
The association of the savings banks of Asia-Turingia, which participates with 85% of Helaba, put the chain to the meeting with the WestLB.
Only NordLB would be left
These geo-strategic reasonings are just an account.
On the other hand, there is also the question of how the different business models of the individual houses are combated.
In June Merl pointed out that the decisive question, with which business model the future of the regional banks would be ensured, would not yet be answered by the German savings banks' association.
In the end, the division of the West LB could also come out, which by that of course is not desired.
Thus the letter of the Board of Directors expresses the will to aspire in any case to a \"general solution\"
You will see how the reunification of the individual parts with the Deka-Bank will work.
The second weekend of the beer festival is dedicated to Italians
For Elena is the first time while for Luca is the third or fourth.
This time Elena is present at the party as a companion, and so says everything is different.
Behind them is a large barile of 5l. of the Kaiser brand and shows about 200 travellers what the deep tones can produce from the throat.
Elena before Luca's a pack and after a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here to the bus car park next to Porta Nuova station, leave this evening at 23.45 four couriers with destination Monaco, Feast of the Birra - , expected arrival 6.30.
Three couriers are reserved mainly for Italians, in another they only travel Brazilian.
In a corner of the parking lot the South Americans are singing with the flag in hand, having already celebrated during the night.
It's so noisy, says Marco, it's not for the Italians.
Marco who wears a long coat with fake fur lining and a couple of glasses with silver-plated broad seals belong to the buses.
For 5 years they've been going to the Oktoberfest, this year there are 3 tours.
The night walk, day to day at the party, back at 22.30.
Staying would only create unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The cost of 45 Euro includes the trip, the welcome of the toast with Kaiser beer, made according to Bavarian genuineness rules, the sickness box and German guide - Marco attended a German course in Frankfurt.
And so at night the buses leave at the turn of the Brenner.
There's no beer yet.
Suddenly the silence falls on the bus, the travellers sleep.
Better that way, they'll still need their strength.
They stop in Bressanone and Holzkirchen, where other buses with Italian plate on the A9 motorway before Munich take a short break.
When, as expected, Marco’s group arrives at 6.30 am to the parking lot near the Theresienwiese, there are already about 50 more buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather together, Marco explains for the last time the attack program.
First, put on the yellow hat.
On it on the left is written to you - Oktoberfest - next to Marco's travel agency's internet address: -Knowledge.it -
Second: \"When they open the doors of the beer tendon, it means running,\" quotes Marco from the early morning.
- Run - Run and occupy the seats at the bottom of the tent.
\"Not in front, we block, and not all the yellow hats sitting on the same benches, split into the tight space\"
The mouth costs 8.25 Euro, screams Marco.
And don't forget to tip.
- Demonstrate the security service, that we behave well!
As soon as you leave the seats, they disappear.
Third: “Saturday at 22.30 pontals we meet again here!
He's already leaving for the party.
On the road one attacks as follow the yellow berets to the trees, to the road signs and even to a billboard of a large Bavarian popular party.
You want to be ready to beat the retreat.
It is the second weekend of the party, known as \"end week of the Italians\"
Exact data do not exist, there is talk of 50 thousand, who leave to cross the Alps and invade the tendons, it is claimed that 10% of the visitors come specifically from Italy.
The police in Munich are reinforced with 7 officials from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which makes a statistics on nationalities, where Italians are first with 200 medical care in front of the English (about 60 medical care) and Austrians (about 80).
Especially loved by Italians is the tendon of the Hofbräuhaus.
1. Sleepless nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors
The German banking system is relatively stable, confirmed the Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück last week.
It is good that the politician has used the word \"relative\" and also mentioned that the German banking sector is not spared from critical developments.
Because the crisis started on the weekend.
IL Real Estate Financer Hypo Real Estate, noted in DAX, obtains from a consortium of German banks a billion-dollar credit, in order to be able to protect itself from turbulence on the markets.
One experienced person told Reuters on Monday, the support credits would reach up to EUR 35 billion.
The Hypo Real Estate must only pay interest for the requested party.
The money comes both from private banks and from the public.
In the end are the losses of the Depfa affiliate.
The state financier according to a newspaper article has been refinanced in very short-term - which is no longer possible because of the lack of market confidence.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's reserves had decreased by 95% over the EUR 2.37 million, and the share of its capital had also fallen from 1.6 to 1.45.
Current income and net income from financial affairs fell to 0 compared to last year, profits from increases in both applications and certain actions as well as from the liquidation of credit provisions dropped more than 70% over the 5 mln. of Euro.
Only thanks to higher income from the refund of subordinate compensation costs that come both from the restructuring of the former Depfa Group and from the repayment of interest according to the single text of tax laws and business management for business consortia, the negative profit was fairly moderate with about 16%.
The former public financier after being privatized in 1990 had been lost in speculation with commercial real estate credits, which were discovered in the Airel Bank.
Since income in the classic state funding was too low, Depfa has engaged more in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint projects of private and state investors (DPPs) and has diversified internationally.
The Hypo Real Estate must now amortize the value of the affiliate, which will have a fundamental material effect on the group's profit and loss account.
The fact is that dividends have been deleted.
In 2007, they had been reduced by 2/3.
The Hypo Real Estate after the absorption of the Depfa is an important financing of the State and the infrastructure.
It is more dependent on refinancing on the market among banks compared to other institutions, because it does not have customer trust deposits.
Because of the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago the lending of loans between banks in large part has dried up, because banks accumulate liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate annually needs for a portion of the Depfa credit portfolio - about 50 billion. - in the short term the means of refinancing.
According to Hypo Real Estate's opinion, the group's financial needs were covered by the credit for a certain period and the company protected by the influence of international monetary markets for the most non-functioning.
From other sources it is felt, that thanks to money the refinancing is ensured until the end of 2009.
The chairman of the Steering Committee of HRE Georg Funke said, on the contrary, that the HRE Group will not need monetary markets in a short time.
The Bundesbank and the National Financial Supervisory Service (BaFin) are based on the fact that the marketability of the HRE group is still ensured.
This is expected for bank shareholders and creditors.
In view of the dynamics and impoverishability of the crisis, there will be no guarantee.
Funding may not be used fully.
But even the opposite is not to be excluded.
After Sunday evening the bank was about to fail, the momentary rescue failed to calm the hearts.
The share rate drops by 75% on 3.30 Euros.
They're pretty good at the classes of the borrowers.
As front-grade debts are almost non-removable, they give way to deferred claims.
The loans are mainly the loans of the Württemberg-Hypo affiliate, which is understandablely due to maturity beyond 2009.
Before the HRE loans seemed to be an alternative speculative investment, their value now must, after strengthening the crisis of banks and the institution itself, which, with the emphasis of the Depfa, has reached the crisis, be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
Only when the central banks, governments and the less damaged banks are still ready, can one count on an annuality depreciation by the end of the year.
Or it goes into effect, which no one can hope - that the financial crisis will be overcome within the next 15 months.
But concerning the information overturned because of partial stateizations, the almost certain probability has become a justified hope.
It will create, above all, long-term investors some sleepless nights with the decision if they are divided by their commitments.
Short-term investors may conclude the return of losses for future payments of the compensatory tax on capital gains.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento-Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, the first day of the school should show up at Tachibana Highschool, the girls begin to redo: The German is completely -kawaii -!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas-nel new Exchange Log tells about Japan.
The first day of school in Japan
How excited I was.
I even had fun going to school.
I dress at the margins of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and I need 40 minutes by train to get to Tachibana Highschool.
I had to find her on my own, and fortunately I didn't miss her.
The beginning of the first hour of lesson does not seem to have been fixed as well as by us in Lower Saxony.
The students arrive flat from 8 onwards, until 8.40 starts a brief conversation with the teacher, the so-called \"home room\"
But before the lesson started, it was up to me to introduce myself.
I am not the guy who speaks willingly in front of people, in addition to a class of 40 students
Since I didn't have the uniform school yet, I put on an old skirt of the welcoming mother, along with a shirt, blue socks and black leather shoes.
Dressed so I stood in front of the chair and tried to say well: \"Sayonara Wo she Sylvana\" - my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and I celebrate my birthday in one week.
At that time I was very happy that I had already started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class have whispered, redesigned and made signs and I have heard the word \"Kawaii\" all the time.
I knew this from my Mangas.
It belongs to the essential lexicon of Japanese girls to survive and meaning - cute, sweet -
Then I ran fast in my shoes.
The girl next to me drowned, for her it was an honor to sit next to an exchange student
The rest of the class hour was continued quietly, but when he played the gong, I was assaulted in the true sense of the word.
Everything talked disorderly, and they were twisting and drying me up with questions - then it's really hard to understand the English of the Japanese.
In the break they all opened their Bento.
My hospitable mother also made me basket for lunch- is different from the boring German sandwiches.
I had risotto with spices, sausages, cucumber salad and algae, fruit and a kind of wrapper with meat and tofu..
I don't even know exactly what I eat in Japan.
Things look weird and have a completely new taste.
It's done, that everything is really good.
Maybe except the plums put under salt, brrr!
The Bentos are not just lunch at Japanese schools.
It happens sometimes that a girl gives a gift made by herself, prepared quite artistically, with the hope of becoming acquainted with the boy during the recreation.
I read it in my Manga comics.
I'm really curious if you can find out.
“Why Japan?” my friends asked me when I told them, which I wanted to go to school for a year in Japan.
I always said,
“Because I’m fascinated
Finally, I have been reading for years with fervor the Mangas.
And to better understand the comics and the culture they contain, sooner or later I started learning the Japanese language a little.
I was completely convinced to come once.
I am also fascinated by tradition, customs and customs.
There's a lot of them here.
On the one hand Japan is a place of technologies and latest trends - from the opposite side: severe, disciplined and traditional.
Since everything is organized well, I have never felt lost, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I have never seen in my life -
1. Rats also have feelings
A rat or a cockroach escapes when they feel the danger.
Neurologist Joseph Le Doux is convinced of it: even many animals have feelings.
4. But how can we verify that when they behave in our own way, they have our own feelings?
For some years, articles of well-known scientists have been published on the Internet newspaper “Edge”.
6. SPIEGEL ONLINE in a series presents answers to the question: “What do you think is true, without being able to prove it.”
I believe that animals have feelings or other states of conscience, without me or anyone else so far being able to prove it, because we cannot even prove that other men have conscience.
But in this case we must at least hope, that all human brains have the same basic configuration.
9. As soon as we turn to the other species and ask questions about feeling or in general about conscience, we enter an impracticable territory, because the reference base does not conflict.
When a rat is in a dangerous situation, he does the same things that other animals do. He pretends to be dead, run away, or attack.
People behave in a similar way, from which some scientists understand that there is a comparable subjective feeling.
I don't believe that.
Two aspects of the structure of the brain make it difficult for us to convey our feeling to animals.
On the one hand, the lateral prefrontal cortex is often linked with human awareness, the associated circuits (this for its direct sharing to short memory and to the executive and control functions).
In man this wide area is much more developed than in other primates and it seems that among other creatures it is missing completely.
At least in those aspects of our awareness dependent on prefrontal cortex, including knowledge, who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, the basis for the assumption that man is even different from other primates is allowed.
Another dramatic feature should be presented in the way of talking about man: since a large part of life is linked to the language, it is often said that it is linked to the conscience.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
Although awareness does not depend on the language, it would influence it so that the awareness of the animal, as it is done, certainly differs greatly from the circumstances of our conscience.
That is why it is difficult to find out how consciousness can be seen in other animals.
If it is not possible to measure it as an internal and subjective thing, in analyzing it through its experience because of the special hardware, their research will cause us great problems.
Most interpretations refer to the content of the conscious experience, but apart from this there is another aspect of the consciousness to which science would be easier to have access.
The processes of animal consciousness could be analyzed without regard to their content, and this is the case in studies on the short memory of primates, particularly in the example of visualization.
Therefore, for this principle, which Christof Koch und Francis Crick follows, he passes before to the neural correlations of consciousness that to causal mechanisms: both could be identical but not necessarily.
Interestingly, this principle also highlights the value of the prefrontal cortex for the implementation of the display.
What, then, about feelings?
I ask them that an emotional system such as fear is activated in one of their conscious brain activities.
What we point out as \"fear\" is therefore the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as the reactions of the body) occupies the working memory.
In this way, feelings are closely related to the regions of bark, which characterize primates and, in particular, human beings.
With the speaking nature you create subtle shades of hearing, because we with the help of words and grammar can distinguish and categorize situations, to describe them to others.
Regarding this, for example, Antonio Damasio believes that feelings result from more primitive activities in the body regions of the cortex and cephalo paleo, similarly to Jack Pankseep, who nevertheless concentrated more on paleocephalus.
Since this network in the course of human evolution has not changed much, this could absolutely be part of the feelings extended to the species.
At a purely theoretical level, I cannot contradict it, but I think it is indistinguishable.
Pankseep argues that what for rats and human beings looks like fear, is probably so felt in both cases: but how could it be seen, if rats and human beings prove the same thing when they behave in a similar manner?
Does a cockroach in case of danger run away as if he also felt fear?
In my eyes the simple similarity of behavior cannot yet prove any vital similarity.
And that is, the neural comparison continues to be helpful: rats and humans have similar paleoencephalies, cockroaches not even a brain.
But is paleoencephalo responsible for feelings?
And when even could it be demonstrated for humans: how would you want to prove it on rats?
I think that rats and other mammals, perhaps even insects (who knows?), have feelings.
But I didn't know how to prove it.
And since their feelings are fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on specific circuits and language), I prefer to study emotional behavior rather than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, there are progress here at the neural level, provided that you renounce the same procedure on rats and men.
As I don't search for language and conscience in rats, so I don't do it on their emotions, I don't even know if they exist.
This may be considered myopy, but I prefer to take steps forward, rather than continually banging against a wall.
I'm actually a practical emotional.
The President of the UEFA Plateni: referral to Poland and Ukraine
Vice Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik said that preparations will soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
\"The government sees the Uefa's decision in Bordeaux as a demonstration of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize the Europeans with Poland,\" said Wasjunik.
This, however, is not an amnesty for our country.
Work has just begun and there is still much to be done in both countries -
Both homeowner countries fall into the roadmap for the construction or reconstruction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports.
Eventually the number of stages to be used for the Europeans will even be reduced from eight to six.
We can't waste any more time.
Now we have to work with the utmost speed - the president of the Ukrainian association Grigorij Surkis said.
The UEFA will keep an eye on us constantly.
An even more radical step has been taken in Poland.
After numerous scandals the management of the Polish association PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee and replaced with the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of Sport Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.

\"In a letter we assured the president of UEFA Michel Platini that the preparation for the 2012 EM will not suffer from it\"

Dennis Quaid outraged ribbon
He wanted to promote a new film, in the interview he spoke about the private and now he has grain with the ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan declared his former Dennis Quaid an adult.
He foams with anger and retries.
Roses War to burst late for the former couple of Meg Ryan spouses und Dennis Quaid: seven years after their separation the two Hollywood actors now dispute with each other a bad quarrel - in public.
Meg Ryan in an interview with the American magazine InStyle last week expressed itself on the grounds of the failure of marriage: “Dennis has long been unfaithful to me, and this has been very painful.”
The extent of the betrayals she would have come to know only after the separation.
The occasion for the \"spoke of the soul\" was the work with Ryan's press for his new film \"The Women\" tells the story of an adultery.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his being publicly declared an adult husband was clear discard: it would be - unheard of - said the fifty-four-year-old at the \"New York Daily News\" - that -Meg for the next time repeats and reworks the history of our relationship -
It would also be - pitiful - that to Jack, the sixteenth-year-old son who had together, again - are publicly reminded of the pain and subversion, which a separation means for every child -
While Ryan from separation lives alone, Quaid is again married and will soon become a parent of twins.
And therefore his judgments are closed with the arrow: \"My life in every case goes on.
I think I'm lucky to have a wonderful family that's all for the best.
Prices for airline tickets and hotels are silent
In the first half of 2008 flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would be up to 50% cheaper
Flights and overnight stays at the hotel have become more convenient again - this is the result of a study by the financial supplier and American Express travel.
The company analysed its booking data for the first half of the year 2008 and after an increase in prices in the first quarter it observed an evident decrease in the second quarter.
After hotel prices have increased for years, overnight stays in many places have already fallen in price.
From January to March prices rise in 41 of the 48 European cities still reviewed on average around 6.9 compared to 2007
However, prices were already 3.6% lower from April to June than in the previous year.
The most evident trend would have been in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay 30 to 37% less than a year earlier..
The American Express sees as a reason why the dollar's fee was weak, which would lead to a “hot desire to travel by American tourists”
Financial centres such as Frankfurt and London would also be affected by the recession of hotel prices in a stronger way than industrial centres such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger
In the Norwegian city hotel prices with an increase of 26.3% even hold the record in Europe
As regards flight prices, the trend in the first quarter still stands at:
Due to the recovery of kerosene passengers from Economy Class had to pay on average 7.1% compared to 2007, long-range fuel intensive flights would be up to 29.2% more expensive
From April to June, economic class airline prices fell by an average of 12,5 % compared to the previous quarter, in the first class and in Business, however, price changes were far weaker.
In Germany prices have fallen even stronger than in other European countries:
From January to March prices rose by 11.9 %, in the second quarter fell by 23.6 %.
As for domestic German flights according to the study, prices have even halved.
The reason for the price collapse would be on the one hand lower economic growth, the company explains.
The demand in many segments of the air travel market has collapsed.
On the other hand, there would be an agreement on open skies, which liberalises air traffic between the USA and Europe, an increased pressure on competition.
Sign of the critical situation would be the abolition of unprofitable routes at the Airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 would have declared failure - only in Europe were 24 airlines.
HSV beats Gladbach for 1 to 0
With a simple goal and methods, Hamburg's SV becomes a chiefist.
Borussia Luhukay still can't find a group of 11 that works.
Here Kristoffer Klein worsens the lucky landing for the national Marko Marin player.
Gladbach's player first entered the game late and failed with a shot on the cross
His message was precisely formulated, passing on his lips convincingly.
He knew he was absolutely right.
\"We need the second goal,\" declared Hermann Rieger in the cabin corridor of the Hamburg arena.
It didn't happen much in the catacombs, the game pause was over and most of it sat back in its place.
Rieger was for nearly 3 decades physiotherapist of the HSV, enjoys an even greater esteem of some old players.
And so his monastery also found listening in the high spheres.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol announced and raised his thumb in sign of approval.
Cornelius is the brother of the head coach of Hamburg Martin Jol.
His order must have sounded like this: here is the second goal!
The change of position did not occur.
\"Today, not everything has been nice to see - he later admitted Marcell Jansen.
Even Bastian Reinhardt would have become more relaxed
For the 1 to zero Hamburgers must thank the head shot went to the sign of Mladen Petric (11) and the fact that the players many weaknesses of Gladbach could not hurt the weak players in Hamburg.
\"It was a dirty victory,\" re-enacted Martin Jol.
The SV in Hamburg this Monday will be 121 years old.
The spectators have already celebrated before, in the afternoon of Saturday, themselves, the blue sky on the arena and the flashing classification on the video screen, which has legitimized their sports society as before the class.
It'll be a birthday without a real party.
\"we're able to set things right,\" said Marcell Jansen.
It has the expectation that the provisional table certificate is more an indication of the unpredictability of the championship than of the dominance of its HSV.
The team with its new late arrivals - the Brazilians Neves und Silva, the defender of the Petric port as well as Jansen blowing at the FC Bayern - finds it slowly itself, but has not yet been able to shine.
\"We need more atmosphere and more Dribbling - relaunch with Jol force.

Dark matter influences the flight of space probes
For years a mysterious phenomenon creates perplexity among scientists: dark matter influences the speed of space probes during the so-called Swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einsteins' general theory of relativity might not be entirely accurate.
The Ulysses space probe has flown through space for almost 18 years.
Because of the fuel pipes that freeze in a hurry, death by freezing now rests on you.
Among scientists for years, a mysterious phenomenon creates a mess - the anomaly of the Swing-by
Swing-by is a flight maneuver of space probes, with which they get additional flash/spin/slip in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example Earth.
So the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The Euro-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical expedition as well as the solar probe Ulysses.
What surprises scholars for years: the breeds do not fully behave as we would expect according to the law on gravitation.
On the contrary, we come to irregularities in speed.
The probes suddenly become faster or slower.
So far the physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
The year has been renamed the Swing-by anomaly.
Some experts fear that perhaps even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which describes the attractiveness of matter with a curvature of space, might not be entirely accurate.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study firmly believes that before Einstein was wrong, and tries to explain the anomaly of Swing-by by means of the so-called dark matter that astronomers have warned in the cosmos.
\"Responsible for anomaly could be the dark matter that could also be very close to Earth,\" he writes.
Of the existence of dark matter, space scholars have only been aware for about 10 years.
From her evidently comes a force of attraction, whose effect on other celestial bodies is shown.
She herself is completely invisible, that is, she does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation of kind, especially no visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists the dark matter constitutes at least a good fifth of the entire mass of the cosmos.
The tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After 10 days in the hands of their kidnappers the tourists kidnapped in Egypt would be free again, as the Italian foreign minister confirmed.
Sudan's kidnappers had asked for several million euros of ransom.
In a shooting before release 6 kidnappers have been killed.
Five Germans were abducted in southern Egypt.
The ransom negotiations are already under way.
The Germans are always in the sight of the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are undoubtedly free.
This has consistently reported Egyptian state television, the Arab broadcaster Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the chronicle of the Italian television broadcaster Sky TG 24: Our fellow citizens and other hostages were released
We are examining their state of health, said Frattini.
The 5 Germans, 5 Italians and a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian companions would be in good health and safe, reported Egyptian state television.
The 19 components of an expedition to the desert are already on the journey to Cairo.
The backstage of a shooting occurred before the liberation of the hostages remains unclear: therefore the kidnappers after the indications of an Egyptian public security officer would be ready for the end of the kidnapping, before the Sudanese army killed 6 of them.
The problem had been solved.
They agreed on a ransom, the official said.
It would still only be trying to take the hostages in delivery - when suddenly came - this surprise -
The Sudanese soldiers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt had killed 6 of the kidnappers and captured 2 of them.
The kidnappers had claimed from Germany a ransom of 6 million euros; the money should have been delivered by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper - El Masri El Jom - reported in reference to a German intermediary, the liberation of hostages would have delayed, because the kidnappers feared for their own safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers wanted to release women hostage after the ransom was paid.
The men would have had to stay behind until the kidnappers had had a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to take a stand on the report .
The abuse of the father-in-law - led to suicide -
Years of abuse by the patriot brought a woman to kill herself, said a court.
Michael Trerise, 57 years old, from Stithians, Cornwall, was in prison for 6 years after having admitted eight cases of sexual assault.
Truro Crown Court learns that he regularly molested his daughter Stephanie Randle, when she was between five and seven years old.
Threeise wrote in a note of the confession: \"I feel responsible for her death\"
The court learned that Miss Randle had been killed in her house in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34 years.
When she was a little girl living in Coventry, Trerise bothered her and kissed her before having sex, while her mother was out working in a pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to Cornwall.
His daughter went to Plymouth.
But the court learned that Mrs. Randle, who had spent a lot of time as a volunteer to the National Trust, was tormented by the abuses they had caused her.
In 2006, the Public Ministry Ramsey Quaife told the court that Miss Randle's friends, who had been a very good surfer and cyclist, were \"emotionally dead\" and that she had - moved with life -
In April 2007 her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
She thinks she killed herself by suffocating with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle comforted his daughter's father, who wrote a letter of confession that ended: \"I tied her and blessed her.\"
I didn't sexually molest her.
I feel responsible for her death.
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: “She is an extremely strange fetishist, and for her victim she must have been terrifying, especially when she was only seven years old.
\"This unpleasant saga ends with the victim who takes away his life.
Even harder is the fact that if he hadn't done it, it would have been difficult for the facts to end before the court.
I'm aware of the effects Stephanie's father and mother have had on their daughter over the years.
\"Others was clearly likely that she was a promising and happy young man of success\"
The officer who lost the data will be punished.
The Office officer who left the top-secret documents on a train in June must be accused by the Officer Secrets Act, learned the BBC.
The man was moving from the Ministry of Defense when he left two highly classified documents on the train to Waterloo.
The documents were passed to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is the least delicate of the charges made under this law and there is nothing suggesting a criminal intent.
BBC defence correspondent Frank Gardner said the movement would come as a surprise to many of the administration.
They would have thought that this was being dealt with internally at the Mod and Cabinet Office, he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is to be charged under Section 8.1 of the Act, the clause concerning the safeguarding of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service recommended that the officer be accused by the metropolitan police because of the highly sensitive nature of his work.
The missing documents contained assessments of al-Qaeda and the capacity of Iraq's security forces.
He was informed of the decision Monday morning and was taken away from his home and taken to a hidden place.
Construction companies face the B&B account
English building companies could face an account of over £80 thousand after saving the Bradford & Bingley bank.
The government gave 14 billion pounds to protect the deposits of 2.6 million Bradford & Bingley savers.
The interest on that loan will be paid by all companies that take the money from the savers, including the 59 building companies.
The Director General of Building Societies Association (BSA) Adrian Coles said it is \"irritant\" that companies and their members have to pay.
The loan of £14 billion will eventually be repaid when the Bradford & Bingley loans are redeemed.
But the interest that will mature in the meantime will be paid each year to the 700 financial companies that take deposits, but the interest that will mature in the meantime will be charged each year to the 700 financial companies that accept deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies would be included in that number.
It's annoying that those institutions that behaved prudently... are now called to pay part of the account of those institutions that have been much less careful.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company had to pay in proportion to the deposits it had, and that companies among them had to pay 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that the interest on the loan will amount to £450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find 81 million pounds to pay the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, director general of the association of construction companies, told the BBC that he believes it is unfair.
\"It is annoying that those institutions that behaved prudently in the home recovery market are now called to pay part of the account of those institutions that have been much less cautious\"
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the documentation began in 1945.
\"We need to examine all aspects in the coming weeks to see what options there are to protect the building companies and their members from what might be a significant account,\" added Mr Cole.
The interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010 the interest of an entire year will be due and this could be almost twice as high.
Since construction companies are mutual organisations without shareholders, their members end up paying the account through higher rates or lower interest rates on savings accounts.
The milk salt has 5 pennies per litre
People in Jersey are facing the fact that they have to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy announced that there will be an increase in wholesale prices of its milk for an extra of five pennys per litre from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after an increase of two pennys in February, and comes after a research carried out by a consulting company.
Retail sellers must decide by themselves whether they want to download the price increase on their customers.
(DANILO) Before the February increase, the wholesale price changed for the last time in 2002.
Denied the bond to the former Prime Minister of Bangladesh
A court in Bangladesh refused a bail request from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which means that you could be arrested when you return to the country.
His lawyers said that the court refused to grant him a bail for extorting 50 million taka ($729,000) to a businessman when he was a member of parliament
The case is one of many accusations of corruption that hang against her.
The long-time political rival of Sheikh Hasina, Khaleda Zia, had been released on bail at the beginning of the month.
The return to Bangladesh of Sheikh Hasina is planned for the next few weeks but its party, Awami League, asked that the temporary government of the country supported by the military on the day before total freedom.
Correspondents say that while you were going abroad for medical treatment on the word, it is not clear according to the terms of your release, if you can stay free when you return to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say he will call on the Supreme Court against the order of the High Court.
\"The High Court has rejected the application for bail for Sheikh Hasina saying that she cannot have the security since she is already abroad on the word for medical care,\" says his lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
\"We shall present or appeal against the order of the High Court\"
His lawyers explain that he needs the security to return to the country from abroad to prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to home after October 17th, a senior leader of the Awami League party said Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the government sided with the military force took power, but was released in June, to go abroad to receive medical care.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against themselves.
Fear of Afghan anti-police campaigns
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan are missing from the recent immunization campaign due to violence related to the Taliban, says the UN.
The UN carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces last week.
But it is said that it cannot reach children in the Helmand and Kandahar parts in the south for security reasons.
A UN spokesperson said that this happens despite the promises of the Taliban who would not attack or hinder thousands of people from the staff carrying the vaccinations.
BSkyB loses legal battle with ITV
BSkyB lost its legal battle with the Competition Commission's decision to force the company to reduce its participation in the rival TV station ITV.
BSkyB was told by the competition appeal court to cut its shares on ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
Previously, the committee had said that BSkyB's participation hindered the competition and allowed an unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought participation in 2006 in an agreement that actually blocked NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading reported that the acquisition of BSkyB participation in ITV raises doubts about the independence of ITV, causing the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
Virgin's head, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and Ofcom's regulator opposed the purchase.
BSkyB argued that forcing it to reduce it is ITV stake was unreasonable and a disproportionate remedy - particularly as BSkyB had said it would surrender its voting rights.
New investigation into the case of the U.S. prosecutor
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special Public Ministry to examine the dismissal of nine American lawyers in 2006.
The transaction took place when a report on the case by the Inspector General of the Department of Justice criticized the actions of the administrative officers.
The report was critical of the White House, the legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was made based on the fear that prosecutors would be removed for political reasons.
The Special Public Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officers questioned during the investigation lied to the investigators in an attempt to hinder justice.
\"Series charges concerning potentially criminal behaviours have not been fully investigated or ascertained,\" said Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
The assignment of a special public ministry with the power to compel witnesses to testify was one of the main recommendations.
The dispute began when nine US prosecutors were removed from their positions by the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At that time, the department said the lawyers had been fired for failing performance.
But later it emerged that the lawyers fired had not been assessed earlier than many other colleagues, leading many observers to conclude that the dismissal had been motivated by the policy.
Some of the prosecutors had been involved in the judicial action against Republican members of the High-profile Congress, while others had refused to investigate the charge of fraud against the damage of democratic electors.
U.S. prosecutors investigate and prosecute on behalf of the government.
They can be fired at any time, but they cannot be fired for political reasons.
The then head of the Justice Department, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, found himself in the storm for dismissals, and eventually reviewed his position.
A number of other officers in the Justice Department were fired.
(The Inspector General's report was very critical with regard to Mr Gonzales' role in the case, saying that he held primary responsibility for dismissals, which had abdicated his role as leader and had been extraordinarily detached during the process.
Other officers, including Bush Karl Rove's former senior assistant, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigations.
The epic of the Meat Loaf will be celebrated
The rock star Meat Loaf is to be honored at the Q Awards for its epic Bat Out Of Hell anthem.
The singer, who will withdraw his special gold prize at the ceremony next week in London, said he was \"honoured\" to gain recognition.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the track of the 1977 Meat Loaf album.
Coldplays will lead the nominations for this year's awards, being on the list of nominations in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor of the magazine Q, said: “There are some songs that transcend things like time and gender, and Bat Out Of Hell is undoubtedly one of those”
The song, composed of Jim Steinman, required a strong vocality that was provided by the Meat Loaf.
It opened with an instrument section that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was made as a single in UK in 1979 and reached the 15th place.
But Meat Loaf's album Bat Out Of Hell remained almost nine years in rank and came to sell more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered from health problems in recent years, including an intervention for an irregular heartbeat in 2003 after having collapsed on stage.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel the concerts.
He later emerged that he had a cyst on a vocal cord.
Dark city streets, often forgotten and perhaps soon for sale
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other crossings, some famous, some merely for use.
But also many veteran taxi drivers and residents for a long time find it difficult to give the position of Extra Place, mostly because they have never heard of it.
The tiny road is in the East Village and goes north from the First Street - without making the Second Street - between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet in width and 120 feet in length, it looks more like a dusty alley than an active trafficked road.
There are no road signs.
It's virtually impossible to see her on a normal atlant.
The road must, however, have admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the real estate company of luxury buildings recently built on the First Street.
You want to reopen Extra Place and create a cleaner passage for shops and boutiques that should open in the new buildings.
Other admirers include neighbors for a long time who say that they were hit by the truncated road simply because it was one of the last remnants of the lady district of the past.
But the department of preservation and development of the city, which has control of the roads, has no interest in keeping it.
During a meeting of the land use committee of the municipal committee of the district some representatives of the city agency and Avalon Bay outlined a proposal for the real estate company to buy the roads.
But the committee prefers that the road remain in the hands of the city, and asked for a new plan to be presented next month, says Susan Stetzer, the district director of Community Board 3.
\"There is very little space left to the property of the city, and we would like the city to continue to own Extra Place,\" he said.
‘There could be proposals to fix and manage it, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want to guarantee public access’
Avalon Bay many months ago announced that he wanted to reopen the small road and install seats, including some to use for a coffee to which the real estate company hopes to rent space.
The idea that Avalon Bay would buy the road was made public for the first time at this month's meeting.
Michele de Milly, a spokesperson for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the road, it does not necessarily mean that it wants to own.
\"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renew this derelict alley and turn it into a public threat,\" he said, adding that the city suggested the sale.
Seth Donlin, a spokesperson for Preservation Accommodation, said it was in fact the city's desire to sell the road and pointed out that the purpose of the agency was to develop the property rather than administer it.
Compared to its most colorful neighbour, Bowery, Extra Place has left a light historical print.
Some believe that he took the name in 1802, when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was divided among his many children and the narrow strip of land was not claimed.
The back door of CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened on Extra Place, and the road is perhaps better known as the set for cover photo of the album of Ramones-Rocket to Russia -
\"The ground was beautiful,\" said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976.
\"It was full of garbage, clothes and pieces of boots, posters, leaves, ropes\"
Some residents, including some bloggers who write “gentrification” of the East Village, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, suggesting that the piece of public property, modest as it is, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rarity - a fragment of city almost for nothing changed that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who has a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled, \"The Book of Complaints: A little nostalgic look at the city in the process of extinction,\" published part of a City History Talk that appeared on The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: “Extra Place is an angusta widow without exit, even day-open and delimited doors of warehouses in rusty iron and windows with the Saracines, with old newspapers of weeks flying along the bottoms”
With few exceptions, the road seemed almost the same as a recent evening.
A rat rushed through the back of the road near a door leading inside the CBGB, which is now the site of an aristocratic clothing store.
On the walls there were graffiti and a 22 ounce empty beer bottle lying next to a group of fresh abandoned newspapers.
Few passersby said they rarely thought of Extra Place but suggest that they would need to be a little embellished.
Mr Fields, for his part, said that he thinks that some people also underestimate the attractiveness of the road in their current state.
\"The best years of my life,\" he said, \"were in black places, dirty and disgusting. \"
The bilingual debate: immersion in English
In this episode of Education, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the position of candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, senior member of California's studies and senior director of education studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book \"Not as good as you think: Because the middle class needs to choose a school\"
Truly attracting Hispanic voters is a complicated deal.
Barack Obama's educational projects are a significant example.
Mr. Obama's campaign notes that — African-American and Latin American students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students — what is true.
To combat these deficiencies in achieving the goals, Obama's educational plan specifically supports, among other things, transitional bilingual education for English students.
Yet, the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes teaching in language classes other than English, does not take into account his interest in filling learning gaps.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in the eastern county of Los Angeles.
School students are mostly Hispanic and low-income.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have recently arrived, are studying English.
But among the fourth students, a surprising 100 percent of the students did the higher level test in the 2008 state math exam.
An equally surprising 93 percent of fourth-grader students did the expert level test on English-language-art.
This incredible result has been achieved using a different ingredient than that preferred by Mr Obama.
Sixth Street emphasizes the passage and exercise, constant evaluation of skills and an attitude of the \"no excuse\" type.
Also, and this is where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, director of Sixth Street, the school's obstructive approach to English students is \"full immersion\"
The use of English emphasizes the almost exclusive use of English in the context of education.
Mrs. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, told me, \"we had a fantastic success with a student just came from Mexico and if you had entered the class 12 months later you wouldn't have been able to find out what it was.\"
\"It works, and it has observed - for us it works -
Would Obama take a model school like Sixth Street Prep to replicate it in other schools by Spanish majority and with English students?
The results achieved by the school make the answer to that very easy question, but the educational policy in its own party (the National Education Associations is a long-standing supporter of bilingual education) and its own continued support for bilingual education prevent the prediction of Mr. Obama's response.
While he agrees that immigrants should study English, Obama has recently trivialized the subject when he said that people should stop worrying about legislation - only-English -
Instead, he said, \"you have to be sure that your children are able to speak Spanish\"
If Obama really wants to close these achievement gaps, he should carefully consider the educational models that work rather than despise or banalize them.
Oil decreases sharply and renews economic fear
Oil prices have declined sharply on Monday because of the concerns that even the American rescue plan for financial markets may not be able to raise the economy.
The futures of the crude fell from 7 percent to 99.80 dollars in the barrel at the New York Stock Exchange in the morning operations.
Prices have lost more than $20 a barrel since last Monday.
In the last two weeks, raw materials markets have been shaken by the financial turmoil of Wall Street, and by a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a peak of $145.26 at the barrel in June, prices were dropped to almost $90 at the barrel at the beginning of this month, before rising again, in the background of tremendous uncertainty in financial markets.
Anxiety influenced investors again Monday even after the Congress leaders said they had reached an agreement on the weekend about the rescue plan, the largest in history.
The news was obscured by the fresh concerns that the financial crisis was far from over.
In the last episode of the progressive merger, Citigroup will buy the banking operations of Wachavia Corporation, the government said Monday.
At the same time, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Barclays Capital analysts said that the frantic negotiations of the weekend had led to a rescue agreement - they seem to have failed to revive the feeling of the market.
As the economic situation worsens, we expect that demand for raw materials, including oil, will calm down.
“The outlook for global equity, interest rates and exchange rate markets has become uncertain,” Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
We believe that raw materials will not be able to escape the infection.
From a perspective of raw materials our most pressing concern is to what extent the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China.
Bank analysts have lowered their expectations for next year while home oil consumption due to slowing economic growth, reducing oil and gas price forecasts by about 20 percent for 2009.
The exploit in the second fourth marks a team record.
After spending more time than anyone with the Jets uniform in the last eight and more seasons, defender Shaun Ellis thought he saw everything.
Then he watched the second quarter of Sunday, when the Jets turned a match without points into a rally.
\"I've never seen such a thing,\" Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals had equalized the grey of the minacious clouds that overshadowed them with a sharp game.
Then the quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles for a touchdown of 12 yards, providing the perfect signal for an afternoon when their growing tune made a huge step forward.
Favre found Coles for two other touchdowns in the fourth, including one when one cornerback fell and another with 10 seconds left at the end of the first time.
\"I didn't leave my path,\" said Favre of all the steps that came to Coles.
He's a great player.
Our communication has been great, despite what people can think -
While Favre and Coles were playing catch games, the defense heavily hit the quarterback of Cardinals Kurt Warner.
The Darrelle Revis cornerback intercepted a wandering launch and released it for 32 yards in a touchdown.
Security Eric Smith planned another move and intercepted it.
The David Bowens linebacker forces a Warner fumble.
The last turner, the smoker forced by Bowens, could have been the most remarkable.
The Cardinals went to the advantage of that ball possession, with 10 seconds left, and after the Jets had resumed the ball with 10 minutes left, Jay Feely laid a 20-yard goal, for an advantage of 34 to 0.
It was more than the Jets ever scored in a quarter.
When asked to describe the madness, Jets coach Eric Mangini said, \"The second fourth or third fourth\"
When he was told both - the Jets granted 21 points with no answer in the third quarter - Mangini said: -I can tell you that I liked the second fourth much more than the third one -
There have been a lot of points in a small time span -
Rested Gebserlassie surpasses his world record
Haile Gebreselassie of Ethiopia showed again because many consider him the best marathon ever, breaking his own world record to the Berlin marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person to run a race of 26.2 miles under 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a win on the well-favourably flat race at 2:03:59, Gebserlassie sends his previous score for 27 seconds at 2:03:26, during last year in Berlin.
At 35 years of age, Gebrselassie sets out the 26th record in the world of such a stunning career that has produced a world championship or a world record at every distance from the thousand metrics to the marathon.
Last month, Gebresselassie jumped the Olympic marathon of Beijing, fearing - perhaps too alarmingly, in retrospect - that air pollution would worsen his asthma problems.
Instead, he decided to run to Berlin.
Under almost perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees on departure, 55 degrees on arrival - Gebresselassie has won Sunday with a discounting average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
As soon as half-fashioners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya went to long distances, the marathon record fell more than two minutes in the past decade, since Ronaldo from Costa del Brazil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After the victory on Sunday, Gebresse told the reporters that two weeks ago he had the crabs to his octopus and he missed a week of workouts.
Clearly, the rest left him fresh, not rusty.
\"I'm so happy,\" said Gebrselassie to the reporters.
- Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and I had some doubts today, but in the end it all went well -
He was a bit criticized - especially in Kenya, East African rival of Ethiopia - for having excessively orchestrated his races, generally avoiding many of the world's best marathon stars, counting on apripit as if it were a mid-bottom race, and putting the world's records above the sense of competition.
But these criticisms rarely diminish the size of Gebressesie's skills as a marathon.
With the pass cadenced by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie reached the mid-way point at 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, held in the Gebrselassie competition after the beekeepers disappeared.
Just over three miles from the finish, Gebrselassie made a final impennade to separate himself from Kwambai, which ended second at 2:05:36, improving his best personal time of almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi arrived third at 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan who is now a German town, has completed a remarkable year winning at 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time ever.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, Mikitenko, 36 years old, was a surprise winner of the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
The Beijing Games have been lost with what is described as a bad accident, but it is healed to win in Berlin, making its best personal time of almost five minutes in the third marathon that has taken place.
You ran a race by doing the calculations well, letting a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners depart with a great detachment, taking them back after about 18 miles and a half.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia arrived second on 2:21.31, while Kenya's Helena Kiprop ended third at 2:25:01.
In a separate city, pride and processes of a black life
Hidden in the theme park extended on the suburbs of Orlando, a few miles from the splendor, from the noise, from the enormous, lies the quiet city where pride and complications of the African-American experience enter life.
Eatonville, the first whole black town built in the country and the home of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as described in 1935: -the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, abundance of guava, two schools and no prisons -
Now it's a pilgrimage place.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to show their respect to Hurston, the most famous writer of Harlem Renaissance.
Yet in many ways, the city that he described - and which makes tourists stop including it in the Florida tourist guide produced by the Federal Writers' Era - remains a separate place.
It is as independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted to share their thoughts with the white man, who, knowing so little of us, does not know what is being lost.
Even now, in a year when a black presidential appointee, Senator Barack Obama, was called for an opening speech on the race, many here remain disinclined from the outsider's gaze.
\"We are very careful about how our story is told,\" Hortense Jones said, 59 years old, a lifelong resident and a member of the oldest church in the city.
\"It must be right\"
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and difficulty.
It is both a historical model of black power taking and a community of nearly 2,400 where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a literary center but also an example in the shade of the oaks of the rural culture of the blacks of the south - sometimes undignified, sometimes awarded - born of American slavery.
Not surprisingly, the residents here are both proud and protective.
And the concern for Eatonville's imagination really started with Zora, everyone here calls Hurston.
She presented the world to her hometown through sincere, dialect-rich books, such as \"Mules and Men\" (1935) and \"Their Eyes Were Watching God\" (1937).
Five paragraphs of Florida's guide turned the city, just outside Route 17, a road that runs through the often forgotten center of Florida within a scenario from black history and human drama
Low as a barn in both life and literature, Hurston brought readers to the shop owned by Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then deviated to more private areas.
\"Out of the road to the left,\" he wrote, \"it is the modern public school, brown with white finishings, with its well-maintained gardens and courtyards, to which Howard Miller always looked, thinking he could just read and write.\"
She also mentioned the new husband of the widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn - sells drinks of all kinds and whatever suits her to the passing rooms -
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston connected Eatonville with self-government but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
Clearly this was not Fodor's.
In fact, it was not a portrait that everyone appreciated.
\"He said it as he was,\" said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's girls who Hurston immortalizes her by quoting men who sing rough songs about their beauty.
Add: -To some people you don't like -
Hurston is still remembered here as a lively eccentric that often returned from his family transferred to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembers that when Hurston rained in the city, he usually arrived without notice in a triumphant Chevrolt, smoking and wearing pants in a city that also today boasts dignified clothing.
Many inhabitants were fascinated, says Mr. Franklin, while others were swindling.
\"People were always very happy to see Zora,\" said Mr. Franklin.
But, he added, giving himself to his chair on the backyard overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, - they never stayed for a long time -
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of print.
Along with the rest of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten it.
Although he was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, he was buried in a dead tomb in Fort Pierce, Fla., where he had lived.
In Eatonville, there were no great commemorative ceremonies, and no major conference.
\"I don't think they understand his contribution to the world or his legacy to everyone,\" said Valerie Boyd, author of \"Wrapped in Rainbows,\" a biography of Hurston published in 2003.
A change occurred in the 1980s.
Orange County officials wanted to place a five-lane highway across the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the main two-lane road.
Orlando's expansion has already pushed the Interstate 4 through the western boundary of the city.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult period of her history.
Forced integration, in addition to other things, had put an end to its idyllic isolation of the community
In the 1950s, the battle over racial mixing brought hatred on the door of the community's home.
\"During that time, a group of white boys came and threw oranges and stuff to the people who sat on one side,\" said Mr. Franklin.
\"In fact, we had a girl who was killed by that once.
They threw a coconut out of a machine -
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston made the Supreme Court a request for forced integration, defining his decision in Brown against the school office - an insult rather than an honour for my race -
Residents now say that the disintegration of schools, despite having been positive in some respects, detracts from Eatonville's cohesion and endangers the confidence of its young people.
\"Black children were used to hugging - I remember this - you embraced your teacher in the morning, hug your teacher in the evening,\" said N. Y. Nathiri, Ella Dinkins' daughter and the executive director of Preserve the Eatonville Community, a non-profit group.
This lasted, he added, until the teachers and students came from the same place.
\"You didn't embrace your white teacher because your white teacher... \"I mean, there's a cultural division there,\" said Mrs. Nathiri.
Civil rights, however, helped and created space for many other Zora Neale Hurstons - black writer, actress and artist who overcame prejudice, as he did, with joy of self-security and lines such as: \"As some may deny themselves the pleasure of my company!
I just can't understand.
In 1975, writer Alice Walker began a long journey into the Hurston Plateless Tomb and began to fight for the resurrection of his reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Robert E. Hemingway's Hurston hit bookcases, reintroduced it into the American canon.
The highway project arrived just as his most famous daughter had held back the lights of the downhill.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The community began to design a festival dedicated to Hurston in 1988 to show what could ruin the state with its highway.
Thousands of fans came to the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return for the commemoration.
Many years later, the state pulled itself back from its road project.
\"The five lanes of the Risen Highway have brought what would be called the high speed, a real pride for the city,\" said Ms. Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd makes it easier: \"Zora saved Eatonville\"
The victory over the highway project helped change the idea that the city has its own.
Those from outside the city like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began coming to church here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and the residents began to re-evaluate the past.
Eatonville was added to the public historical register in 1998.
A new bookstore on a single floor (called Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on a renovated and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly of Florida: only six miles from downtown Orlando, can give the feeling of a secondary road under the summer rain, small as when it was founded with only 27 black families in the 1980s of 1800s.
(It's 90 percent black today.)
The outsiders who come to look for the history of Eatonville, for its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
A permit requested in advance is required for most of the interviews, to some things - like the walls on the older church of Eatonville, painted by a white man, who show black men in the fields - do not have permission to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Ms. Jones, a fat teacher, with a weak for bright red, still fear that their island community will be misunderstood.
Yet, as the Hurston festival expanded, a high level of citizen pride also emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville with Hurston saw his entire race: beautiful, problems and everything, no better, no worse and proud, creative, great worker, foolish and confused like other ethnic groups and races in America.
It is sincere civic affection what can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew Edwin Harvey, 18 years old, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or the Police Department, who said he might need help.
And even those younger, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
\"Many people, if they have just entered here, will think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others,' said Alondra Kenon after the Mass on a recent Sunday.
\"But if you really stop and take a moment to look at the story, it's really a pretty city\"
Here in New York we all talk fluently about finance
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan were to stay away from newspaper stalls and the huge TV screens in Times Square, they would not notice to be in the eye of the cyclone.
They would never guess that the glass offices, at the bee nest above their heads the bankers and hedge fund managers that monopolize New York live every day the worst - gross day in the office - since the fall of 1929.
The farmers shake metal carts for the through the sidewalks, carrying muffin trays for breakfast meetings.
Latin-Americans drag their feet between condoms, carrying, like human mules, 50 and broken shirts pulled attached to a stick on their shoulders.
Employees are still waiting in line for their bagel in the morning to the food carts on the sidewalks, and it is still impossible to take a yellow taxi between 16 and 19 on a working day.
It did not seem that there was a real crisis, until, with all the talk of ruin and sadness, I decided to open a new savings booklet on Thursday afternoon.
Although I had planned the matter so that it coincided with the late afternoon break at my JP Morgan Chase subsidiary, a tail of about twenty was already waiting in line.
Not in front of the door of the cashier, to withdraw money or make deposits, but in front of the door of the customer service, where old customers order cheque books, tourists ask for directions for the large store Macy and new customers open accounts.
Many of those who are in front of me, I would have learned from Starr, my \"trust banker\" were in line for my own reason.
Unlike me, however, they have already taken savings from smaller banks from places where commuters, such as those from New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They have taken money from so-called Thrifts (a little like a construction company), credit cooperatives and types of city savings banks whose subsidiaries operate only within a state, and say they treat customers as family.
In the past years, 15 of these banks have failed.
In recent days, the Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, was submitted to the controlled administration, and while the New Yorkers were heading home for the weekend on Friday afternoon, another bank, Wachovia, with savings deposits of $440 billion, was looking for a buyer who saved it.
The employees and traders who were in front of me, frightened by another collapse, were moving their money to a bank perceived as a safe port, the bank that is asking for more security on Wall Street.
Common New Yorkers in recent weeks have become financially competent.
A woman at my trusted Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the bank went bankrupt, and to her emaciated CEO Dick Fuld in all familiarity, as if licking off a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the doorman in uniform, almost fifty years from my condo, has changed the subject regarding our normal conversation topic about Brad and Angelina or the delivery of my expense.
She told me, after my visit to the bank, \"So I have all my savings in market funds!.
I've changed, I'm not taking any risks.
Desecrated Muslim Tombs as Austria turns right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, on the left of the Austrian right wing of the Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right party of Vlaams Belang, take part in an event to present the organisation \"City Against Islamisation\" in Antwerp, Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry signals such as those road representatives mosques with a red line passing in the middle.
The police blamed the right-wing extremists for desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same week that the political parties on the far right earned a lot in the national general election.
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged at the Traun cemetery, near Linz, in a few hours between Friday night and this morning, in what the police think was an organized action.
The culprits traced with the Jewish symbol spray like David's Star over some graves, but the detectives believe it may have been an attempt to mask the extremist motivations led by a hatred for Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is somehow tied to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said that they were \"deeply shocked\" by the news of the desecration, which took place towards the end of Ramadan, a month of religious significance for Muslims.
In the meantime Austria embarked on a journey of spiritual research following its right turn in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two extreme-right parties that took almost 30% of the votes, the Austrian Freedom Party and the Alliance for Austria's Future, made a campaign with vehemently anti-immigration ticket and some of their slogans were defined by xenophobic critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the votes, made a campaign against the sails and the burkas and also expressed his opposition to the foods that are perceived as related to Islam.
At the final meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a \"European brotherhood\" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties seem to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, indicating that they are political symbols of a continuous Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which established the extreme right as the strongest political blockade of the nation, indicating that the change was led predominantly by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Travel abroad banned at Gary Glitter.
Gary Glitter, the glamorous rock star guilty of sexual abuse on minors, was forbidden to travel to France and Spain from the court.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed the authorities that he was in charge of wanting to go to Spain through France.
The ban on travel abroad was granted to the Kent police on Thursday after he provided the magistrates with evidence of previous arrests of Glitter for sexual abuse of minors.
Glitter, the real name Paul Gadi, was not present at Ashford's high school hearing in Kent but was represented by Corker Binning's lawyers.
A spokesman for the Court Service said: \"On Thursday 25 September, at Ashford, the Kent police filed a request to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd's travel abroad in France and Spain until 25 March.
‘Paul Gadd was not present in person and
Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad as requested by the register of convicted persons for sexual offences.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
He is also asked to give the police a seven-day notice on his planned departure date.
Failure to notify the authority may lead to a five-year prison sentence.
Kent police said they don't want to discuss individual cases or possible Glitter movements into the country.
A spokesman for the Kent police said: “Kent police will do everything they can to protect children in this country or abroad.
From our point of view, it is easier to control someone who stays in the UK because we have suitable comprehensive systems to manage any potential risk more effectively.
\"Protecting Kent residents is the main concern of Kent police and we work closely to monitor the behaviour of convicted persons for sexual offences registered in the country to minimize any possible risk to the public.
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after having spent 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for having abused two girls aged 10 and 11.
When Glitter arrived, he flew to Bangkok where he was supposed to be on a flight to London.
But he said he was sick and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities would not have passed him into passport control and finally took a flight to Hong Kong.
Even the Chinese authorities did not let him in and returned to Bangkok where the Thai police and immigration officers insisted that he return to England.
At the end he arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on August 22 and remained there while his lawyer David Corker went to Uxbridge's Pretura in West London, since Scotland Yard had successfully applied for an order to place him in the register of convicted sexual offences.
Glitter had previously been imprisoned in the UK in 1999 for having had images of child abuse.
A source of the Ministry of the Interior said that Jacquei Smith, the Secretary of the Interior, felt reassured and happy that Glitter had been stopped by travelling to France and Spain.
\"Photographer away from the scene to extract his character\" Günther Bauer, photographer
No heels, no flying, no clothes before.
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenco, stripped of the concentration that characterizes the interpretation, to look at the relaxed appearance of man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Two inseparable faces, except in private, at those moments away from the audience, when the intimacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of the hands, are natural because they must not go on stage.
The German Günther Bauer in -Flamenco-People - alternates the theatricality of some shots to singers, dancers and guitarists on the stage with the least known side of these masters.
With this objective, the photographer offers an original iconography of the flamenco, taking it from different visual angles.
The exhibition, included in the planning of the Flamenco Photography Month, reflects the international importance of this dance, every day increasing, - explains the artist and clarifys that in \"Flamenco-People\" could also be common people, but seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists, performers or performers on the scene.
These people portrayed - on the road - are artists able to transmit passion, sadness, joy when they are on stage ... and capture the public.
In order to grasp the personality of these great ones it is not necessary to portray them on stage,
because their personality and character are inner.
What I was interested in was creating an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture with the camera the personality of the flamenco’s big ones -
With the passion for the festival -Sante de las Minas - Bauer began in 1997 a long journey to portray singers, guitarists or dancers using a camera with slabs.
They are portraits that, because of the type of machine and the material, remember the classic photograph.
The application of different stylistic techniques breaks with the traditional principles of the image, giving the photo modernity, according to an idea that reflects the conception of Bauer's own flamenco: \"A music with very traditional roots that evolves and is able to surprise each day\"
Not dancing, singing or playing in itself, but the artist's personality, his character, capable of conquering the audience with his art.
The search for a meeting with essential elements, with the magic that becomes visible in a certain way of hearing and being, are and have been the constant of this work, in exhibition these days at the El Fotomata gallery.
Famous flamenco artists such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, appear in this selection of about seventy portrait artists.
The project has become a sort of anthology of flamenco, and will soon be published in a book that will collect the exhibits on the occasion of the exhibition.
The passion for portraits led Bauer to repeat the idea two years ago with \"PortARTproject\" portraits of veteran athletes.
Although in -Flamenco-People - the concept is different, the photographer admits - I love to portray people, to know them and to be able to penetrate for a moment in their lives, both a long or a short moment.
I think the portrait is the most difficult kind in photography.
You meet or meet people, characters you sometimes don't even know, or they only give you a few minutes to take the picture.
Beyond these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas -
The collection of portraits of the contemporary flamenco, entitled \"Flamenco-people\" is set up at the El Fotómata gallery, at the number 20 of Via de la Mata, parallel to Via Alameda de Hercules, and will be open to the public until the next 16 October.
Vargas Llosa reveals that the novel she's writing is a \"lucky\"
He is set up in places that he does not yet know and deals with unknown topics: despite this, Mario Vargas Llosa is at the scene with a new project he is working on, a novel whose protagonist, Roger Casemant, is an Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in Congo and crossed the Amazon.
Always favorite for the Nobel Prize for Literature, the writer confessed yesterday on the occasion of the Hay Festival in Segovia, that the project he is dealing with today - he is a gambler - and that - everything indicates that I should not write it -
\"If I had a good sense, I wouldn't write it, but I will do it equally, and I hope to finish it as soon as possible,\" he concluded his intervention at the festival for the exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that for four days he saw passing through the city of the Aqueduct a hundred writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people.
The author of \"The City and the Dogs\" was, as a forecast, the figure of prominence at the third edition of the festival of the word.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award to be the most voted writer by the participants - an ancient edition of Dickens' book Our mutual friend - filled the places of the Juan Bravo theatre.
Presented by Félix Romeo, the writer found himself in front of an audience to whom time has flowed when the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with great doses of humor, has re-evoked as he was born the literary vocation, derived from the \"extraordinary adventure\" of the \"pleasure to read\" and -to live beyond what I lived - as he writes in -discipline mode - to supplicate the \"lack of inspiration\" with an intense work of documentation, writing and continuous re-doing; as Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexander Dumas have influenced his vocation and how - the images of memory - are the basis on which his stories are placed.
The Spanish-American novelist, he acknowledged that - there is no way - to measure and know if the books can change people's lives, - but I refuse to believe that literature is a pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience, - he stressed Vargas Llosa, claiming that, on the contrary, \"has effects\" and that -renders the most anticonformist people - That is why he invited the writers not to give in to frivolity - and to - assume responsibility for their vocation.
Time hinders the Festival of Pozoblanco, depriving it of corridors
The celebration of the corridors that should have sealed the days of the Pozoblanco Festival was suspended yesterday morning, after the towers selected for the corridors had verified that the ground conditions of the square were inadequate.
Therefore, the company, in agreement with Fermin Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernandez, decided to suspend the celebration of the race.
The weather has come to an end against this festival, preventing it from celebrating two days out of three.
On Saturday, the rain prevented the second race of bulls from taking place.
In signposts were Jose Luis Moreno, Curro Diaz and Juan Bautista, who had to face a bull of Castilblanco.
Therefore, the Festival had regular performance only on Friday.
On this occasion it was Daniel Luque to triumph, cutting three ears and being brought out in triumph, after having toasted with taste and aesthetics.
The same afternoon Alejandro Talavante completed his two runners by collecting greetings and an ear, granted more by the public than by the race itself.
The worst among all was El Juli, passing through the arena of Los Llanos without glory and without pain.
With the second bull, after a tremendous crutches, you earned the chips most of the audience.
A truck with two thousand pounds of hashish overpass the block seat in Alava
Five minus ten in the morning.
Agents tell the two occupants of a van that instead of stopping, they're running away.
Agents have summoned the high two occupants of a van that instead of stopping, they've run away.
Their load, more than two tons of hashish, is a good reason not to stop.
The officers after having followed them, manage to arrest one of the two occupants, a man of about 28 years old, identified as A.A.J., as reported in the statement of the Department of the Interior of the Basque Government.
The arrested individual is accused of drug trafficking and forgery of public documents.
The incident occurred when some officials of the Alava road were carrying out a transport check on the N-1, at the point where it crosses the municipal constituency of Armiñón.
They rushed to stop a truck for inspection when the driver, transgressing orders, rushed sharply and crossed the block.
Agents followed up until the vehicle, after a couple of kilometres, stopped on the side of the road and its two occupants ran away in a forested area.
The Ertzaintza agents were thus able to arrest one of the fugitives and to kidnap the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they carried and have once inspected the van, an Iveco Daily.
The hashish panthers, which were located in the back of the vehicle, were subsequently placed in police custody for a thorough investigation and the detection of weight.
In addition, since the officials found that the registration had been (doubled) because it did not match that reported in the documentation of the van, the arrest was also charged the offence of forgery of public documents.
Ertzaintza is continuing investigations to arrest the second suspected person, who has managed to escape as already said, and to determine the origin of the kidnapped drug.
Detainee A. A. J., 28 years old, was brought to the police station to carry out the appropriate procedures and be available to the judge in the next hours.
Arrested actress Heather Locklear for driving under the effect of drugs
The actress Heather Locklear, the Amanda of the popular Melrose Place series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the effect of drugs.
A witness saw him perform risky maneuvers while trying to get out of the car from the parking lot in Montecito, as revealed in the magazine People by a spokesperson of the California road.
The witness specified that around 4.30 p.m. the Locklear -- she was tearing down the accelerator, making a lot of noise, and trying to get the car out of the car from the parking lot with sudden maneuvers forward and back. Doing back March, she passed several times in front of her sunglasses --
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who had apparently not recognized the actress at first sight, saw that Locklear had stopped on a nearby road and had left the vehicle.
It was this person who alerted emergency services, because - she was worried about Locklar's life -
When the police patrol arrived, he found the actress sitting inside his vehicle, which partially blocked the road.
It seemed confused, and for this reason the agents led it to a specialist drug and alcohol use center to undergo a test.
According to a police spokesperson, the actress has been collaborative and the hypothesis of over-alcohol has been discarded since the beginning, even if, according to what the officers have observed at first, we believe Locklar was under the effect of some medication -
The Locklear was arrested with the suspicion of driving under the effect of some not better specified substance and was imprisoned in the local prison around 19.00, to be released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear was re-established by a specialist clinic in Arizona after being recovered following an episode of anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian UI federation to take responsibility in the Silva case
The General Coordinator of the UI and member of the Izquierda Unida Party, Gaspar Llamazares, confirmed today that it will be for the regional training federation to make a decision on the case of the former advisor to the Youth and Sport of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week following the accusation of clientelism.
\"In these cases I am particularly federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that has to assume its responsibilities,\" Llamazares said with regard to the resolution that the party will have to adopt with regard to what has been up to today in the Seville Council.
However, the UI leader stressed the need for “transparency” in all possible investigations regarding the irregularities that Silva would have committed. “The UI has always wanted this type of investigation to have the utmost transparency.”
Similarly, he stressed that training is regulated by very strict ethical codes for all public positions.
‘Sangre de May - the epic bet of Garci
Inspired by the National Episodes of Benito Pérez Galdós, Jose Luis Garci reproposes in Sangre de May the famous revolt of the Spanish against the French, in what is the most ambitious film of his filmography, with almost 15 million euros of budget.
With this film, the director tried to \"illustrating the multitude of characters and at the same time the social analysis - which has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutierrez and Paula Echevarría in charge of a wide cast of interpreters.
Sangre de May, for more than two and a half hours, debuts this Friday in cinemas, to become a television miniseries in the future more than four hours on TeleMadrid.
A great admirer of Galdós's literature, Jose Luis Garci argues that he had made this film, a dream of his childhood, and believes that he should thank Esperanza Aguirre, that the Madrid Community had commissioned him three years before he turned a memorial film for the second centenary of 2 May medrilègno. The director had agreed on the basis of the story of the novel Episodios Nacionales.
The 15 million budgets allocated for the whole of the Madrid Community represented for Garci a unique opportunity to recreate the appropriate scenography and costumes to portray a - a twisted Spain that erred the leader's choice to fight for and the fact that the struggle for independence brought to the people a huge delay in development under Ferdinand VII's kingdom - observed Garci.
However, the director regrets that he did not receive funding equal to those of Alatriste or Los phantoms de Goya - more than twice as much as Sangre de Mayo, so it was not possible to turn some scenes provided by the stage which he himself had signed together with Horacio Valcarcel, a collaborator of almost all his career.
This, for the director of Volver to begin, influenced what is his usual work practice, the staging with the actors, with whom he often uses to try before turning together with those who will not be part of the cast, because he considers it \"humiliant,\" considering that \"part of the director's work lies in going to theatre and to cinema to know what is going on in the field in which he works\"
Many of the performers, part of which are part of the cast of Sangre de May, are facing his car, as in the case of Michael Rell, Carlos Larranaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Candidate to the Oscar for four times - winning one - Garci believes that none of the three films candidates to represent this year Spain at the Hollywood Academy - its Blood of May, Seven tables of French billiards and, the last selected The blind sunflowers - do not represent the younger generation of Spanish cinema - which should instead be known -
From this movie Garci you don't expect prizes.
\"At first you believe you work for posters, then you realize that you only work for prosperity, and at a certain point you conform to simply spinning an extra film,\" explains Garci after more than 30 years of career.
Isabel Bayon rediscovers the Swiss essence of the dancer Tortola Valencia
A Seville ballerina pays tribute to another same dancer in Seville.
Carmen Valencia Tortola, Catalan father (Florence Tortola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the district of Triana, and at the age of three he moved with his family to London.
She was a free dance dancer and an oriental dance specialist.
He led a fascinating life and was a pioneer of female emancipation, the calibre of Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was Buddhist and vegetarian, and defended the cause for the abolition of the corset that prevented women from moving freely.
The life of this woman, who marked a revolution in dance and aesthetics in Europe between the two wars, has always fascinated Isabel Bayon.
“I would have liked to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposes this character to me. I felt incredible.”
She supports the ballerina: \"We do not intend to tell her whole life, but gather her spirit.
The titles of his dances suggested some basic elements of flamenco.
So, - the butterfly dance - suggested me a guajira, or - the snake dance - some tangins.
His dance was sensual and it was told me that my way of dancing is also part of this aesthetic, explains.
The staging includes two exceptional contributions: that of Miguel Poveda, who will sing again Isabel in one of her performances, as she does, \"The Open Door\" and that of Master Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work with the one who had been a girl of hers.
“Mattilde plays Adult Tortola, the character of maturity.
I'm happy because you agreed to work in my work and I feel very honored about this.
The installation also includes the musical composition and guitarists such as Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, the song of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga y Moi di Morón; the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa La Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfran Juárez - who interprets the role of eternal companion of these artists who have been dive all round, and who have always had many spasimants -
In the work is also present in some form the life of this woman, which takes place in faraway places, especially for that time, such as India, the United States or Russia, and then the whole of Europe, as she habitually resided in London.
“I wanted to remind you because I think it is one of the women who have had a huge influence in a given historical period and now nobody remembers it and so much less considers its work as something of value,” Bayon says.
The show will begin today at 8.30 p.m. at the theatre of Lope de Vega.
With the publication of the \"Diary of a newly married poet\", the Triennium is also closed
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the \"Diario de un Poete Reciencasado\" at the church of Saint Stephen (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Council for the Culture of the Junta dell'Andalusia to celebrate the \"Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramon\" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the death of both.
Thus, the “Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramon” concludes with the reissue of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel's museum house and with the traveling exhibition “Juan Ramón Jiménez: That flood of light” which was inaugurated last May and which, after touching the various provinces of Andalusia, will be expected to arrive in New York in conjunction with the International Congress.
In addition, the Alderman for the Culture of the Junta dell'Andalusia acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the \"Diario de un Poete Reciencasado\" by Pietro Tabernero and illustrated by James Perez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and the work of one of the most valuable Andalusian poets.
America likes a little less without Paul Newman
God sometimes creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of these -
The phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him in \"Ausencia de malice\" and gives the idea of the impotence of American cinema, and of all America, in the face of the shocking idea that Newman left.
And yet it cost him a lot to deliver an Oscar to him.
And since 2007 he has been retired.
And he also knew he was very sick.
Despite this, it was a very hard shot for everyone.
\"Sometimes what one proves goes beyond any expression, and I have now lost a great friend,\" cried Robert Redford, \"my life and my country could have been better thanks to its existence\"
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or overreacting.
A father of cinema and homeland died in a particularly dark moment, for fear of terrorists and markets, with self-esteem from the American people on the ground, in desperate search for new motivations to feel worthy.
When the times are so difficult, men so without virtue and there remain good people to admire, it does not need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For everyone he embodied the ideal platonic of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and defender of lost and winning causes, from the foundation for the fight against drugs created in honor of the firstborn dead of overdose to the creation of the brand of home and organic food.
All gifts to a country that has cost a lot to go beyond a suicidal food culture.
The wave of admiration went beyond Hollywood, without caring for nationality or passports.
The last James Bond, the English Daniel Craig, observed that he did not die a man, ended a time.
Another Englishman, Sam Mendes, award-winning director with Oscar, said that working with Newman constituted nothing less than the apex of his career.
The bad boy who arrived from Australia, Russell Crowe, has darned to define Paul Newman as his greatest inspiration.
“He left a very high-level example for all of us,” notes George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today try to live as Paul Newman did: keeping in high regard the need for rectitude and to have a serious private life away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or possible in today's media jungle.
Some, however, are trying and Paul Newman is a good example for them.
He divorced once but remained married for fifty years with Joanne Woodward, to whom he remained faithful even though he certainly did not lack the opportunities not to be.
\"Because today I'm going to eat out hamburger, if I have a steak in my house - it's just a joke.
In heaven he accompanies the pride that his daughters on earth are also his admirers, something not so common in America.
\"Of all the great roles that he interpreted, no one was as proud as that of a devoted husband, loving father, noble and passionate philanthropist,\" they say.
The imperfect race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that sooner or later the Olympics will be held in Madrid and, after the failed attempt for 2012, this could happen in 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday's race, I'd say no!
They called it the \"perfect race,\" but in my opinion it was by far the worst one I've ever witnessed.
A lot of nonsense, which would then be taken into account when evaluating and I had to examine them, would be totally negative.
But let's go by order and start from the beginning.
The nonsense began with the removal of the back, which supposed to go before.
It didn't seem like a wrong idea, but if you're forced to go, that's to withdraw everything (including the chip to avoid the code during the race).
No, you don't.
You had to go just to take the back (first nonsense, go only for this) and (after its tail), surprise! they only t-shirts of 'S' size (second nonsense, because I need an XL size).
What world do we live in?
Is it the fault of the crisis if they decided to buy only small shirts, made with lower fabric and thus less expensive?
Well, things like this are ineze compared to the same day of the race.
In addition to having to go very soon to take the chip, the queue was 15 minutes and, moreover, you had to deposit the backpack.
The waiting period lasts more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a race to which more than 11,000 people are expected.
So, as expected, the race began that we had not even yet deposited the backpack, although, once successful in the enterprise, the recovery was even worse.
In addition, the rain threatened the wait of more than 40 minutes, to which attempts of popular rebellion and assault at the stand were added.
In at least 500 people tomorrow we'll definitely have pneumonia, and some, like me, won't even be in the correct rank because of the chip that, I guess, didn't record the arrival correctly.
In the future, if they ask me about the perfect race, this will not go into my thoughts.
So I think we will continue to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft search receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT Conference on Emerging Technologies, Microsoft first presented a new system of recognition of human image and interaction, a kind of artificial intelligence, but without much intelligence, able to perform some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or, in the case illustrated by Microsoft, a shuttle service to move within the company campus) assisting the phone user.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this \"receptionist\" is able to know how many people there are in a room, who are - including remembering their position in the company - and to listen to and understand the keywords in a conversation with them.
You can also group those in conversation groups.
In the video of example the receptionist detects a third person, but realizes that he does not belong to the group he is talking to and that he is not an employee of the company.
She asks if she's there to visit someone and tells her she'll be at her disposal soon.
All without blue screen.
Impressive.
But this, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better to focus on, for example, the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week we talked a lot about a change of strategy in Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if computers were equipped with the essential functions and less loaded with commercial trashing, they would go five times faster - hey! Steve, it will be for the least -
All of a discovery, if you take into account that Microsoft, version after version has continuously added to Windows functionality and -extra -
The change of direction is appreciable.
Microsoft is right: the operating system is increasingly losing importance, and with it the software.
When Google launched Chrome into the network, I was one of those who supported the theory that it was Google's first step to compete with Windows.
Many rightly stress that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is an essential element for hardware and software to communicate.
Do the same thing as your wife or husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law.
It's true.
It will never disappear, but perhaps it is necessary to think of the \"death\" of the operating system not as an absolute but relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People always pay less and less attention to the operating system, and increasingly to the web browser.
You take the computer just to launch Explorer or Firefox - or Chrome - and daily we spend more time browsing the network than in a remote window environment.
What are half the applications of the operating system for?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less overload, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services to make them a valid alternative to Google.
They have a desperate need, indeed, and I bring here a small example.
I took the photograph inserted in this post in one of the recreation venues for Microsoft employees, in Redmond, at the beginning of this month.
On the bible machine a sign prompts them to use their own research tool - -Your search. Our future -
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees use Google to do a network search.
Last week, the delay in the development of the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was confirmed.
It will not be placed on the market in the early months of 2009, but probably at the end of the year, if not even in 2010.
Microsoft will definitely try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
After all, the cell phone is becoming more and more a computer.
But the delay, with Android and iPhone already on the market, is penalizing.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the Blue Coast, Leonardo di Caprio shined in Edward Zwick's 'Diamante de sangi', as well as Al Pacino ne 'Il Padrino' by Francis Ford Coppola as well as being part of the typical uniform of the gay church musculosa.
And if we try to list the appearances of the stars, we can recall the image of the force with the pointed poach that lifts the weights in the traveling circus.
It is essentially the typical men's shirt, with the inside of cotton, attached and without sleeves.
It is the 'tank', as the Anglophones call it, even though the Belgian Fabulouse Marcel stands out above all.
La-Marcel - excels in comparison to others for the high quality of cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive stem and for the small Belgian flag (only recognizable), that the most emblematic models of the shirt bear as detail on the neck.
La-Marcel - excels in comparison to others for the high quality of cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive stem and for the small Belgian flag (only recognizable), that the most emblematic t-shirt models carry as a detail on the neck.
And be careful, because the Belgian company's production is not just about the famous \"tank\"
It also includes college sweaters, retro boxer, cashmere cardigan, cotton pants, marinara shirts, baby-dolls, mini shorts...
Intimate clothing designed to be comfortable.
And it's a shame to use them as underwear.
They're too nice.
\"I want to be a young mother, the candidate doesn't worry me\"
The great resemblance to her sister did not prevent her from developing her personality.
Monica Cruz is small, but full of vitality.
Currently, Cruz sisters have taken their new fashion activities very seriously.
For Monica, they are much more than beautiful girls and celebrities who lend their name.
It was in Paris for the promotion that the company Mango made of its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important prizes that the Spanish fashion house sponsors.
Warm and shy, you win quickly.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that we designed my sister Penelope and me for the fall-winter season of Mango, as well as to participate in the presentation of the second edition of the Mango Fashion Awards and the dinner at the Opera in honour of Valentino.
Let's say, a very intense day, but at the same time, exciting.
From what elements does your new collection for Mango take place in this fourth working season for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I like the movie of the '50s, it's '60s, so we get a lot of inspirations from here.
Then, I love to lose myself in the city and observe how women dress, how they combine and mix their clothes. I often do.
Ballerina, actress and stylist, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, even if at the end, everything is confluenced and there are many elements in common.
As a child, I liked the clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to rub in my aunt's cupboards and see her clothes.
It was a bomb, even better than going to the playground.
Then, once a dancer, I always paid a lot of attention to dressing.
It is known that dancers like to have their own style to go to lesson and to the wise, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of an actress, when they deliver you the wardrobe, it's the moment when you really meet the character.
So, everything goes together, yes, with a lot of respect for stylists and professionalism.
Not long ago, you turned 30, you went into crisis?
But no.
Never heard better, I like the 30-year-old idea.
I find that at that age women are mature and have a good experience to enjoy life by making less mistakes.
I'm not afraid of the biological clock.
I've done the things I wanted since I was little and this has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, you think you're going to be a mother, right?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because she asks me for my own body and also I want to be a young mother, that's not what I want to miss.
As for the candidate, I don't worry too much.
What I will do will be to give my son great happiness and educate him with great love.
As far as cinema is concerned, you're waiting for several films to be shot last year in different rooms.
That's right, and I really want them to come out.
Being a woman who comes from the theater, I am very impatient and restless, I would like everything immediately and clearly, but it cannot always be that way.
I want you to get out, the last hour, and, in search of the tomb of Christ,
Let's see if you'll like it.
A few days ago you debuted on the walkway with Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like you're on the bridge as a model.
Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for a long time, simply called me to ask me to go to London to participate in a charity parade for her organization - Donna for a better world - and the clothes we have exhibited - I brought two pieces of our collection to Mango - were auctioned to collect funds for this Naomi NGO.
People don't know this tender side of Naomi.
So many things are said about her, that I have known her for a long time can confirm that they are not so true.
Besides, I'm with this good part where you're involved.
He asked me to show up for a noble cause, but if he asked me to pine, I would have done it the same way.
If it's to help women in the third world, you can't go back.
Reciprocal drivers of alcoholism will have to install the ‘alcolack’
The Ministry of the Interior requires that drivers with three administrative sanctions for excessive blood alcohol, install in their car the system that prevents driving the vehicle in a state of wear or if it does not blow in the appropriate device.
The measure was announced last June and is already included in the annual report of the Attorney General's Office, according to which it will be a one-year pilot project.
The purpose of this project is to reintegrate the driver, since this will have to take a rehabilitation course on the road.
On this initiative, in addition to the Attorney General's Office for Road Safety, the Directorate-General for Traffic (DGT) and the Technological Institute for Automobile Safety (FITSA) Foundation will participate.
According to the statistics, between 30% and 75% of drivers reported more than once to drive in a state of hebness then back to drive the car.
Alcohol would avoid it, because it is a vehicle-related system that measures the alcohol rate in the air inspired and prevents the car from being powered if the driver does not blow, or when a higher alcohol concentration is detected than that permitted.
The cost is more than EUR 1000 and would be borne by the sanctionee.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles fitted with such devices allow to reduce up to 65% of the offences committed during the first year of introduction.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people a year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to put an end to these conducts before they become criminal offences.
And in order to facilitate its development, since legal reform can be carried out on a regular basis, and without doubt the reform needed for the criminal procedure would require an organic law.
However, the device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial solution, although it has already been introduced experimentally in some industrial and public vehicles.
Just tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote for an initiative by the PSOE in which it intends to install this system on school buses, as has already been done in France.
In Mexico, and without \"peep-toes\"
With British punctuality, at 17.40, the second programme, the Spanish plane in which the principles of Asturias were travelling landed in the presidential hangar at the Benito Juárez airport in Mexico City.
The sun was setting but the rays still forced to use the hand as a visor to see the real pair descend from the plane.
At the foot of the ladder, the Spanish ambassador and the other authorities.
A few hours earlier I had asked a taxi driver, on the road, if he knew that the Spanish princes were going to visit the city to formalize an official trip.
- Ah, very well, so you can't go to the airport to load people at that time... you're from here or...
No, no, sir, you're Spanish, but you lived here for a couple of years.
- Oh, very well...
The Mexican press, on the other hand, knows very well who are the principles of Asturias and the importance of travel.
There are many waiting in the airport hangar crushed to the red carpet and the military cord composed of 27 marine soldiers who offer the honour greeting.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in sea blue, and she, the princess, hot in the wind, very sober, does not use her usual-peep-toes, - perhaps told her that in Mexico City he threatened bad weather.
They give the photographers a smile and a short break before they pass through the hall where they are expected by the official committee.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four largest in the city, they are expected to have a beautiful Mexican television reporter.
The best prize offered by fashion
There is probably no place in the most appropriate world to present a fashion award, which is not Paris and probably there is no more exquisite stylist and bont viva di Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of El Button-Mango Fashion Awards, to promote the international promotion of new talents in the field of fashion.
It offers a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at his drawings in the window of Mango at number 54 of Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost cried out of emotion.
On the other hand, it is the second store of the company per size in Europe and has just been opened with 1,335 square meters of extension.
The first one is located in London.
The many events, combined with the desire of pleasure to the stylist Valentino who presided over the jury of the competition, started with a luxury dinner at the Opera Garnier in Paris.
With the proximity of Chagal's most exquisite canvases, the presidential gala table prepared by Mango, it was even more spectacular.
Born, with the heart breaking and making necessary virtues, due to the recent death of his brother, he wore a dress of the House and some complements of ELAH to remove the breath and arm of his son Luis - a young man nearly two meters high - accompanied Valentino to the presidency of the dinner of homage.
Andik, owner and lord of Mango, did the honors of the house and of the knight who finished, together with Baron Rotchil, without jacket, because they had both given them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who has managed the shop in pants and shirt - designed by her hand - has transformed for dinner, wearing a long, very sensual black dress and has excited herself during the night walk accompanied by Goya Toledo inside the work, when they showed us the room for the ballet essays and she, remembering other times, has grabbed a bar and dropped a - big fold -
Inés Sastre did not stop for the walk in the premises of the palace, but he had shown us his son's photos on his cell phone before.
The next day we were delighted by the presence of Olivier Martinez - another young man who moved by motorcycle - and John Travolta, who had arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris, with his sheets, towels and had previously made sure that there were no odors in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, this is life.
1001, the number antistress
There are not 1,000 but 1,000 and a way to forget the chaotic and frenetic daily life.
And as if that was not enough, they are all collected in a book that will bring relaxation in the libraries on 30 September.
Awakening is almost a punishment when it flashes every morning at 7, but it is still worse to imagine involved in the frenzied pace dictated by modern life.
The office's called tension and the computer's back damaged.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
However, there are neither one nor two methods to combat daily exhaustion and the struggle to get out of the world of work.
No, this number amounts to nothing more and nothing less than 1001.
Beyond the yoga positions, the classic massage or treatments - spa - Susannah Marriott collects in the pages of his book, all a -menu - of tailor-made options for each one's taste and time.
The anti-stress work is entitled -1001 ways to relax - and its calm will reach the bookstores thanks to the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If anyone believes that it is not possible to conquer calm in areas such as work or personal relations, this -manual - disagrees with such conviction.
It also suggests alternative solutions, such as being in contact with nature, or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline doesn't flow into your veins already to regain the balance of the body and stress has become a problem, it's time to sit on the sofa, turn your mind off, and focus on reading.
Speaking in sleep
Some children talk during the night.
I am not referring to those who wake up very agitated to tell us something that happened to them the day before, but to those children who speak being asleep.
The first time it happens, at most one gets scared, but it doesn't really matter very much.
It is a benign alteration of the so-called dreamloquio sleep.
It is manifested with a certain frequency, especially in children and adolescents.
Of course, most of you said you talked in your sleep.
This phenomenon can occur in a very sporadic way (once in life, for example associated with an episode of high fever) or with a greater regularity (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the day after the child no longer remembers anything.
There is no single reason to explain this phenomenon.
Sometimes there are episodes related to other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night fears, night enuresis (doing the piss in bed), or sleepwalking, but not necessarily so.
As already mentioned above, it can be associated with very high fever stages, stress or overcrowding situations.
In any case, it is still a little studied phenomenon.
Also the intensity with which it appears is extremely variable.
It can happen that the person speaks with a very quiet tone of voice, with loose words, almost in a whisper or that it happens the opposite (scream, scream, long speeches ...).
In cases where the event is particularly intense, the child should be observed and a specialist should be consulted to see if there are any issues that are causing an abnormal state of anxiety as a result of the situation.
We have said that it is a benign alteration so there is no treatment unless it is associated with other sleep disorders that can be treated (for example, if coupled with insomnia or stress).
What can be done instead is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to overexcite the baby before he goes to sleep.
Provide quiet games and avoid television programs or series that provoke fear or suggest violence.
With very nervous children for whom it is hard to relax, you can use relaxation techniques to help them gain some inner calm.
This will allow the child to sleep more quietly.
Once sleepy people appear try to keep calm.
Remember that I am harmless to the child and that the next day will not remember anything that has happened.
Useful tips
Don't wake him.
It's useless, because he's not aware of what's happening, and you'll interrupt his sleep.
Although he's talking, he's asleep and so he's resting.
Remember that if you appear very anxious and the episodes have a certain frequency it is better to consult a doctor or check where there is such a great anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not the most common situation), do not fall into the temptation to question him for information.
You will get nothing, because he is asleep and therefore not conscious to organize his thought.
In addition, you are able to hear what it says but not to see what it is dreaming to say, so you must pay close attention to the interpretation of the information and the conclusions to which it might bring.
Don't ever tell the child that you could ask him questions during the night to know his secrets.
Not even for jokes.
Something like that causes a lot of anxiety.
In short, don't worry, it's nothing serious, it's an episode that only takes a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
The Illhaeusern finally found the road to victory in the house after a long period of infictuousness.
Without playing a great game, the Giallo-neri have created the largest number of network opportunities transforming one into the win of the game.
The rhythm was not much sustained during this meeting in which the attackers expressed themselves to fatigue.
After a first attempt by the captain of the Kauffmann guest team who shot the seven with a long shot, the Illhaeurn began to have the best and one after another provoked the defense of Dannemarie, Fonderflick from afar, then Hirn alto, Romain from a point point and still Diebold.
The Dannemarie responded with a block at the center of the camp, leaving only the Riahi shooting at the point of attack.
The beginning of the second time was decisive with two initial occasions signed Riahi and Temporal for the Dannemarie, and immediately after the first network of Marais for the Illhaeusern, well positioned, took a ball rejected on a first attempt by Diebold (53').
But the canonier of the Illhaeusern will not enjoy his happiness for a long time and will be expelled a dozen minutes later leaving his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But the Dannemarie will not be able to take advantage of it and will not put great problems to the Eleven of the Illhaeeurn, buried just to \"strengthen\" the defense, except in the last minutes of play when, after a rock action, the ball struck the cross.
Sarkozy meets the fishermen in anger
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a stop in Britain.
In the first place, the President of the Republic decided to go on Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in the Finistère department, to charm its representatives.
The latter promised to welcome him, in a constructive spirit, and hope that he will be present with concrete proposals.
A presidential visit that takes place at the same time with the general assembly of the \"crisis committee\" created by Breton fishermen in order to take measures to deal with the impennata of the price of gas oil, which reached its record with an average of more than 1,14 euros per litre.
According to Eliseo's spokesman David Martinon, the president - with them - will discuss possible solutions to help companies regain competitiveness and to secure working conditions and the remuneration of seafarers -
The fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy to get worse.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out \"lumaca operations\" in Morbihan and Calvados, causing almost 10 km of ingestion.
The port of Quiberon has also been blocked, but the connections with Belle-Ilele have not been interrupted.
A roadblock has been implemented on the Quiberon peninsula.
On Monday the sailors have already proved their determination by burning, starting from dawn, tires and pallets in front of the fuel deposits at the ports of Brest and Lorient, while taking foot demonstrations in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement extended to the ports of the Atlantic coast and the Manica, such as Sables d'Olonne, in Vendée, where the vessels remained on the dock, or in Havre, where twenty boats prevented the movement of the commercial ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe et del Croisic, at the Loire Atlantica, stopped in the evening the blockade of the refinery note Total of Donges.
In Boulogne-sur-Mer they decided to wait for the meeting to be held on Wednesday at the Ministry to decide on any actions.
In the Guilvinec, the \"crisis committee\" will decide on Tuesday the future actions of the movement and the possible participation in the planned meeting of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by those responsible for the National Fisheries Committee, who did not support the movement.
\"The strike will continue,\" said Liliane Cariou, president of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel oil, currently pay about 50 cents per litre, but estimate that the yield limit of a vessel is reached only with a gas oil of less than 0,30 euros per litre.
Paul Newman the Magnificent
The unforgettable performer of \"Butch Cassidy\" died of cancer, at the age of 83, in his Connecticut home.
Hillary et Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and again Sam Mendes welcomed the film legend and busy actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains delivery forecasts in 2008
This year, the aircraft manufacturer has 215 deliveries, despite the recession threats on the world economy.
Embraer, the fourth world company in the sector, maintains delivery forecasts for 2008 with the delivery of 215 aircraft, confirmed its President Fredrico Fleury Curado.
During the first semester, he delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian company relies heavily on the Chinese market, especially for the aircraft of the range between 30 and 120 places.
To date, Embraer delivered in eight years 41 aircraft to Chinese customers.
AIG would yield more than 15% of its activities
The American International Group insurance company, which was set up by the U.S. monetary authorities, would give more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion loan, according to the Financial Times' Sunday edition.
The AIG is ready to consider the sale of much of its activities, in addition to the sale of life insurance branches to the international market and to the United States, it specifies the newspaper on the basis of more than authoritative sources.
The Board of Directors of the AIG met on Sunday evening to consider any transfers, according to the FT.
No confirmation was obtained at the IGA.
The activities that the AIG intends to give up include the International Lease Financial Corp. Air leasing subsidiary, its share equal to 59% of the Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and its investments in private equity, adds the FT.
No definitive decision was taken on these transfers, the FT continues.
The AIG must quickly find liquidity in order to repay the loan of 85 billion concessionaires from the Federal Reserve, at the cost of seeing the US authorities impose 80% of its capital.
Paris: History Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange accused a historic collapse on Monday, after the House of Representatives expressed itself against the Paulson Plan for the rescue of financial institutions: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, i.e. a decrease never seen, approaching 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Media (DJIA) ended at 10.365,45, below 777,68 points.
In terms of points, the worst loss in its history (684.81 points) exceeds that of 17 September 2001, the day of the reopening of the Stock Exchanges following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
Nasdaq, the index of the main technological titles, lost 199.61 points closing to 1,983,73 and the extended Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 8.81% (i.e. 106,85 points) closing to 1,106,55, being the final closing figures.
Delayed at the beginning of the session, Wall Street was deepened after the unexpected rejection of the bank rescue plan, designed to restore stability to the markets.
With 228 votes against the plan and 205 in favour, the representatives refused the funding required by Treasury Minister Henry Paulson.
About two out of three Republicans refused the plan.
\"It's a negative signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan,\" said Lindsey Piegza, of FTN Financial.
\"All this indicates how much the market counts on the project,\" he added, fearing that in a few days it might already be - too late - to adopt one.
\"If the project were actually dying (...) then the witness would quickly be passed to the Fed-Fed-Fed Reserve- (the American Central Bank, ndr) and other central banks to resolve the crisis, which would further limit credit conditions,\" said Brian Bethune, head of the finance and economy sector at the Global Insight.
And still highlighting the state of emergency, - every day that leads to the collapse of a financial institution - in the United States, has emphasized Piegza.
After the fall of the Washington Mutual on Friday, the authorities organized the purchase of the banking activities of Wachovia by the rival Citygroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated sharply, calling for urgent action in favour of the banks of the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that the markets - not only face an American crisis but also a global crisis - have added the analyst of FTN Financial.
The bond market has risen strongly.
The yield of the Ten-year-old Treasury bonds is down to 3,632%, against 3,827% on Friday evening, while the one with 30-year maturity is 4,161%, against 4,357% on the previous day.
Obama to the advantage of the first television duel
After the first Friday debate between the two candidates at the White House, here's a second to know who, between John McCain and Barack Obama, was the winner.
Without any surprise, the headquarters of the republican and democratic campaign proclaimed the respective victory of the television duel, followed by a third of the American families.
Politologist David Gergen believes that the performance of John McCain, although worthy, has not been brilliant enough to allow him to slow down the five-week surveys by the presidents.
The Gallup Institute, of which a published opinion poll on Saturday gives a five-point advantage to Obama (49% versus 44% for McCain), shows that the democrat had the best.
An instant poll conducted by CbsNews on a sample of undecided voters, noted that 39% of them consider Obama the winner, while 25% points to McCain.
An excellent performance by his teammate Joe Biden, expected during the first and only debate with rival Sarah Palin, should confirm on Thursday Obama's advantage.
\"To underestimate it would be a mistake.
He has a good intuition - however he warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
Seventy-year-old McCain has never stopped promoting his undisputed experience in foreign policy, stressing the \"ingenuity\" of the opponent regarding the issues raised during the first face-to-face.
Senator Obama does not seem to understand that. He has often said many shots.
\"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and skills needed to become president,\" he said.
What has been an ongoing target for the republican television campaign since yesterday.
Obama, for his part, stressed how his election would represent a new future.
Without delay, it has proved concise and precise.
He promoted his predisposition to the right decisions and his intention to restore the United States image on the world stage.
\"McCain has never understood, unlike Obama,\" he said, \"this weekend, a democratic spot, reproaching the Republican for not taking the necessary measures to deal with the impact of the financial crisis on the American people.
During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had much to say about me, but nothing about you, he denounced Obama yesterday, before 20,000 people gathered in North Carolina, under heavy rain, for an election meeting.
He has not even spoken the words \"media class\" or \"workers\" The financial crisis goes in favour of Obama, considered by Americans to be the most suitable person to save the economy on the edge of the precipice.
\"Next week could be a turning point,\" said the influential democratic senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's economic intuition with that demonstrated by Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current collapse - is the final verdict after eight years of terrible economic policy adopted by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain -
Reiterating the intention to reduce taxes for 95% of Americans in spite of Wall Street's successes, the Senator of Illinois also mentioned among his priorities the achievement of a possible energy independence of the country through the promotion of renewable energy and the implementation of a health insurance system.
McCain, for his part, would build a park of 45 nuclear centers by 2030.
With caution, the two candidates drew up the applications focused on the $70 billion financial rescue plan (470 billion) adopted last night by the Congress and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, you did not notice that the elections were in place.
Young people and opponents displayed Sunday evenings in the main square of the Belarusian capital to contest in advance the results of the legislatures.
A few hundred Belarusians met on Sunday night immediately after the closure of the electoral seats in the central square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent character of the legislatures.
While the results were still awaited, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexandre Loukachenko: - the dictator, resignations -
Some confess that they didn't even vote: \"What's the pro? They'll do what they want, my vote,\" says a boy.
They do not believe that the regime which has made it clear to the foreign observers in order to resume dialogue with the European Union is ready to take a democratic turn.
Penalties, including the visa ban for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of property, could be removed if these elections were considered legitimate by the observers.
They weren't, according to the opposition.
We have been removed from the electoral committees and our observers have not been able to take part in the vote cast - Jouri Potemkine, spokesperson for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous alliance of twelve parties.
It is a factional change, says Alexandre Milinkievitch, former candidate for opposition to the presidents of 2006 and head of the pro-European movement, because the important thing is who counts the cards and in this case is the executive.
If Members of the opposition enter Parliament, it is because they have been appointed, and not elected.
But their entry into parliament may include a television space, regional meetings and proposals for legislation.
The opposition therefore has a duty to enter the political game because it needs to start dialogue with the European Union.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, is in crisis, and we do not provide for any reform, we are in danger of becoming a Russian protectorate.
Now we want to be independent. -
The opposition fears that the ‘security and cooperation organisation in Europe that followed the electoral process will recognise the validity of the vote.
It stresses that participation rates appear to be too high, and that the generalization of the vote in advance (26% of the voters in Minsk) has led to all manner of manipulation.
\"Did you not notice that the elections were in place?\" asked Social-Democratic leader Alexandre Kozoulin, one of the last two political prisoners released this year in August.
There was no one at the polling station.
And there will have been no more than five Members of the opposition to parliament, the most appropriate Members of the Parliament -
The night silence falls on the square of October.
On television, President Loukachenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission welcome their success.
The meeting - Blood is safe again
The Héma-Québec celebrated yesterday the tenth anniversary of its foundation, and its president, Dr FrancineDecary, had every reason to rejoice, for Hema-Québec has become one of the safest and most effective providers in the world.
And above all, it has regained the public's confidence, seriously shaken by the scandal of the infected blood between 1980 and 1990.
As we know, the national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were infected by the acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C in the 1980s.
In the face of such a tragedy and the protests of the population, in February 1994 the Government of Canada conducted a public investigation, conducted by Judge Horace Krever, which aimed to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to disseminate recommendations to prevent the recurrence of a similar disaster.
While Judge Krever was slow to draw up a report, some provinces set up a committee with the aim of designing a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, this mandate was carried out by the Gélineau Committee.
Following the Gelineau et Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Hema-Québec to provide Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society for all other provinces and territories.
In 1998, when Hema-Québec started its activities, just 38% of people declared that they still had confidence in the donation system in Quebec, Dr. Décary recalls.
The situation was mortifying.
Thanks to our continued efforts to improve the safety of blood samples and field research in the following years, we have regained public confidence - it explains before saying proudly that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of Quebec's population had already trusted in Hema-Québec.
However, Dr. Décary is convinced that trust is something extremely fragile.
Since its establishment on 28 September 1998, Hema-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At the time, there were many cases in Europe of the human variant of the mad cow, a new manifestation of the softness of Creutzfeldt-Jakob, telling the president that she has been in the presidency since 1998, the year of the foundation.
“And we didn’t know at all if that disease could be transmitted through infected blood.
There is therefore one of the main recommendations of Krever and Gélinau's reports, according to which when there are doubts and there could be a serious disease, in this case the disease of Creutzfeldt-Jakob which manifests itself with a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, exclusion measures are taken.
In April 1999, the blood of those who had spent more than a month in the United Kingdom since 1980 was refused.
Now, for some years now, it has been shown that this disease is undoubtedly transmitted through infected blood.
This episode has thus shown us that it has made sense to apply the precautionary principle -
In 1999 a much more efficient technique appeared on the market for the identification of HIV: Nucleic acid (TAN) tests that allow the blood of donors to recognize the presence of the virus and not that of antibodies against it, on which the tests used until then were based.
TANs have allowed to reduce the window period, that is from the moment the person contracted the disease to that in which the first viruses can be detected in the blood thanks to our techniques, explains the specialist.
This period could have been reduced to less than one week.
The risk of ignoring the presence of infected donors and therefore not being able to identify them is thus greatly diminished.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS with a blood transfusion.
Today, one out of 12 million people are at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
In other words, this means that it will be necessary to distribute 12 million blood samples before someone gets infected with the HIV virus.
Since Hema-Québec distributes between 400 000 and 500 000 blood samples each year, it will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmitted with a transfusion is found.
I think we can feel calm today when we receive or prescribe a blood transfusion to recover the health, says the head of the Hema-Québec management.
Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen will emerge in the system.
No later than a year ago the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted into the blood by an insect.
We need to be constantly vigilant - Dr. Décary continues before stressing that in addition to having secure resources, Hema-Québec must also provide enough for it.
The need is increasing as the population is ageing.
Being the most aggressive cancer cures, patients often need a supply of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has consequences on the number of donors that on average constitute only 3% of Quebec's inhabitants acceptable as donors -
However, all healthy people who have attained 18 years of age and who meet the eligibility criteria may donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14% of those who offer themselves as donors are not accepted, because they are affected by AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have traveled to a country where the latter is widespread, they will be refused for a period of one year.
With this 3% we manage to maintain an inventory capable of meeting the needs of hospitals.
The cases of hardship are very rare.
But it is necessary to renew the members of this group of donors as they age and can no longer make donations.
It is now difficult to convince people to donate blood, but above all to keep it and to encourage them to become regular donors.
Today life is so frenetic that it is difficult to find an hour to donate the blood - says desolate Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Québec not only distributes blood samples but also human tissues, including bone transplants, globular heart valves and skin that is used almost exclusively for severe burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being deposited with Hema-Québec, which manages the only public bank for umbilical cord blood in Quebec.
In the umbilical cord, which was once considered a biomedical waste, it has blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
\"We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the insertion into the bank of our thousandth cordon blood sample and planned to take over more than a thousand each year.
You should start to propose them for transplants at the beginning of next year - says Dr. Décary who describes this practice of drawing cord blood as very popular.
Many mothers are delighted to have no access to you - because Hema-Québec does not have the means to propose this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Calcium - The Impact in semifinal
The Impact Montréal qualified for the semifinal of the eliminations of the A series, winning 3-1 against the Seattle Sounders yesterday, during a second decisive match of the quarter finals, at the Saputo Stadium.
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro marked the decisive goal at 90'.
After an empty first time on both sides, David Testo and Rocco Placentino marked the successive networks for Montreal.
For the Sounders, Roger Levesque was ready to score Matt Jordan.
Let's remember that on Friday's first round of the journey-back, the Impact had a defeat of 2-1 at the Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, on the outskirts of Seattle.
The Impact will face Vancouver Whitecaps in semifinal.
On Saturday evening in Minnesota, the Thunderler has filled a first 3-1 in the game of return winning 4-3, but the Whitecaps will still participate in the semifinal.
The Impact will face the Whitecaps both Friday and Sunday, but further details will be confirmed during the day.
Brief - Decisive Kovalev Network
The Canadian and its axes are ready to start the season again.
The trio formed by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn animated the offensive phase of game winning 3-2 against the Panthers, Florida, last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the star of the first meeting, scored a goal, made two steps, and picked up a passage for victory, in the fourth of the Hab's preparatory games.
Decisive for victory the only network signed by Kovalev.
\"I'm not ready yet, he warned the Russian.
I need another game to feel at ease -
\"He tried to cheat in the first period, he noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he enjoyed the success of the game.
There was a beautiful ovation -
Charest to the North
The Prime Minister does not rule out the launching of elections before the end of the year.
At the conclusion of the General Council of the Liberal Party, Jean Charest went to Jean-Talon yesterday, in Quebec where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (on the left), tries to get elected during today's partial elections.
\"Enlarge the borders of our last major north border: this is Jean Charest's long-term ambition, presented yesterday in Levis, by means of tools with strong visual impact, on the occasion of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec.
Behind him, during his speech, the projection of a sort of \"Muline to images\"
On three maxi screens, they were confused with the spectacular negatives of hydroelectric dams, mining crops, images of Quebec seen with \"Google Maps\" maps, etc.
Big means like in the middle of the election campaign.
During the press conference, moreover, the Prime Minister refused to exclude the opening of the autumn elections, even though he pointed out that he was very busy.
The North Plan is the fourth point of a project, which the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a new economic area, which includes a first agreement with France on labour, a second agreement between Canada and Europe and other agreements with Ontario.
Often appointed in the most recent speeches of the Prime Minister, the opening of the North - the northern territory to the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister has only explained why the North would be - a jewel of immense potential - but it has not spoken about timings or investment quotas, as it has not explained what the precise priorities will be in the implementation of future projects.
At the same time, it has only pointed out what it considers to be a priority position: hydro-electricity, forests, but above all the mining sector, which has experienced several improvements since the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
According to Charest's list, the North contains — nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds —
That - large territory the double of France - is here, is Quebec.
Not only is it here, but it is inherent in us - he insisted, as if he wanted to call for a national founding myth.
The foundations of Quebec are rooted in its relationship with the North, he stressed: gold fever in Abitibi, national engineering, James Bay.
\"It is our future,\" he added, after a theatrical pause to contemplate the vast map behind him.
The North, 70% of the territory of Quebec, includes a part of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, specified the Prime Minister during the press conference.
It is a traditional position maintained by all governments.
There is a border line on which no agreement has existed for a long time and, when the occasion is presented, I will reiterate that position in the name of the government - it indicated.
On the other hand, - in view of climate change, we must re-evaluate the North - he said he was talking about the passage of the north-west, which will be open all year round because of the melting of ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister estimates that occupying the territory is a duty.\"
And the inhabitants of the place, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec Government would be very careful about this and that the project would meet their interests, especially those of young people.
Two former ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former MP of the QP of Ungava), have already set out to consult about thirty communities.
An inter-ministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has taken an important position, has started work.
The Prime Minister does not rule out a great meeting, not necessarily a summit, but a time when common visions will be provided.
The development of the North would also adhere to the principles of sustainable development.
The North Piano will be - concerted, ordered and will respect the environment - promised.
Jean Charest described this project as a continuum with that of the first liberal ministers who preceded it.
- Like the liberals who have preceded us, we know how to distinguish ourselves in order to transform the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.
On the other hand, this was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a great cocktail in honour of the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage as head of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to re-establish the Beauharnois Centrale in Dice Adélard-Godbout.
“From Godbout, creator of Hydro-Québec, to Lesage who nationalized hydroelectricity, to Bourassa, creator of James Bay, our party has always been able to forge the future,” Jean Charest said.
During the press conference, he used another reference, conservative this time, John Diefenbaker's \"Strade North\" programme, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
Faced with the project on the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam, Charest stated that its operation would be planned for 2012.
\"All of this remains between us, but I feel that we will do it,\" he confessed to his militants, raising applause.
In fact, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and probably not even in 2009, did not miss the opportunity to start a poll in autumn, which could happen in accordance with the law.
It stresses that it is certainly very committed, particularly in a mission of the Federal Council in China and the Quebec-New York Summit.
The General Council of the weekend provided the Liberal Chief Executive with a platform for nationalist resolutions, in particular of the - constitutional aspirations - which have passed read like oil: the PLQ calls above all for the recognition of the \"specificity of Quebec\" in the Constitution.
It also hopes that Quebec will appoint the members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and that the latter will have a veto over the decisions taken in Quebec.
With regard to the opposition, the Northern Plan's abbot has been sceptically accepted.
The PQ leader, Pauline Marois, resold the North Quebec Development Policy launched by the Landry Government in 2001.
According to you, the liberal government, which came to power in 2003, would not have respected its application.
If he had, - we would have progressed today - the Marois commented alongside the candidate of Jean-Talon (scrutinity happened today), Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has stated its support for the adoption of the Northern Plan by the government.
\"What we hope for is that all of this is not just perceived as a show,\" said leader Sébastien Proulx, a substitute for Mario Dumont, returning from his holidays today.
Letter - A Dishonored Country
It was Vic Toews, the former minister of the \"Justice\" (irony of luck) of cabinet Harper, to allow himself to declare, last summer, that Louise Arbor was a \"virgin\" for Canada.
Dishonoring in this way a woman who has fought tirelessly for justice and who deserves all our admiration says much about both the Prime Minister's entourage and Stephen Harper himself.
First of all, there is a government that is the only one, among all the countries in the West involved, not to have repatriated its citizen held in the concentration camp of Guantanamo.
A government that does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a mere teenager at the time the facts were committed.
The only government that, despite signing the Geneva Convention, refuses its word and lets a child-soldiers march in inhumane conditions.
The only one who trusts in a parody of justice to establish the guilt of the accused.
We remember, for information purposes, that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Order of Canadian Advocates, in particular, call for the return of Omar Khadraffin to be subject to a regular process in Canada.
It is precisely the same government that closes its eyes from the beginning to torture: it does little to care that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, perhaps forever, after many years of suffering.
We are not yet aware of this, but we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, freedom and democracy - word that Harper does not stop resisting and that sounds so foolish about his lips.
Here we have arrived at the time when there is no moral anymore: one can abuse, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen according to the discretion of a head of government until today's minority (to see what will be after 14 October...).
Numerous voters believe that a party that preaches the Virtue, the Respect for Law and the Order represents salvation: they do not see that this government has renounced what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame is right here, Mr Toews, in giving up all this, and nowhere else.
Free Opinion - The Orwellian speech by Barrick Gold
In the 17 September edition, Le Devoir published a letter by Mr Patrick J. Garver, vice-president of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Pursuing an Orwellian logic, the latter asserts that the world's largest air carrier has carried out a six million defamation claim against three authors and a small, quadruprinated publishing house with the intention of starting a \"transparent public debate\"
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of a complaint for defamation, but the law.
Without any surprise, this substantial difference is completely hidden by Garver.
As for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would lead to ruin anyone who supports a position contrary to his position.
The success of the process, the writers and the publisher of the book Canada Black will have to spend a huge sum of money in order to organize their own defense and fight, with resolutely learned weapons, against an army of lawyers funded by the pockets practically without the bottom of the mining company.
On the other hand, in these struggles with learned weapons, the tactic is often to ruin the defendant in order to impose a consensual regulation that strikes the opposition beyond scaring anyone who can pronounce themselves on the issue again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it is first to the public that he should have presented his own view of the facts.
Contrary to what is happening in many countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada usually take place with the exchange of views and not with the use of manganel.
It would therefore be sufficient for the company to open its books, documents and establish a real debate, through newspapers, media, publications and the financing of independent research teams that could shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold doesn't seem to have too much confidence in public opinion and misappropriate petitions and letters in support of the authors of Black Canada.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he can ask for a debate - public - when his contempt for that same public is very evident?
In the vice president's world, it seems that this word only indicates the perfumedly paid lawyers and not the entire Canadian; here is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In a democratic system, even denigrators have the right to speak.
What Barrack Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - is that the public who supports the authors and editors of Canada Black does it first because it rejects the brutal means adopted by the mining company.
This audience is ready to listen to Barrick and judge, but on the basis of civil exchanges of opinion, and not in the perspective of what many perceive as a sort of engagement (searching the \"public debate\" Barrick Gold has just given the authors of Canada Black an ultimatum urging them to suspend the use of that word...)
Beyond Garver's surreal speech, the Barrack Gold's complaint is a direct attack on the freedom of university research and the pursuit of truth, indispensable in every democratic society.
It denies the right to citation of authentic sources and to debate on facts and interpretations, which are the very basis of intellectual work.
If, in a country like Canada, it is impossible to study and discuss uncomfortable subjects to the world's richest businesses, it is a pity for many who want them, who can do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, he could do so by following scientific standards as the authors of Black Canada do.
You have the right to reply.
For a long time, the university environment, which we are part of, has been able to handle debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
The excessive measures of Barrick Gold clearly show that, contrary to its claims, it does not seek a transparent debate at all.
This goes to the detriment of the university world, as well as the same public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to take measures that can limit abusive desires.
Operation - rescue for Wall Street - Dialogue between Republicans and Democrats
The Bush administration and the leaders of the Congress, representatives of the republican and democratic deployment, came to an agreement yesterday on the biggest plan saved-finance after the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the 700 billion US dollars plan, which aims to put a stop to the financial crisis that has been on Wall Street for months, still needs to be ratified by the two chambers of Congress.
It provides in particular: checks on its actual implementation by the elected leaders, new mechanisms that guarantee the reimbursement of public money, new provisions to contain the number of damaged houses for non-payments, as well as a right of inspection on remuneration paid to the managers of the protected companies.
The U.S. Secretary to the Treasury, Henry Paulson, the President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi and the Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday at the end of a two-day negotiation marathon.
\"We have made great progress towards an effective market agreement,\" said Bush administration representative Henry Paulson.
Every decision has been taken in such a way as to safeguard the American economy and people from the current crisis on Wall Street.
\"It's the crucial point: if we hadn't acted in this way, inestimable discomforts and disturbances would have poured over the daily lives of Americans,\" said Republican Judd Gregg.
The conclusion of the negotiations was marked by concerns about the impact of a new bankruptcy on investors.
The agreed time limit corresponded to the opening of the markets this morning.
Together with the negotiations later, the two candidates for the American Presidents were rather in favour of the agreement, but did not, however, express their dissatisfaction with the adoption of extreme solutions.
The democratic senator Barack Obama has the merit of adding some provisions to the agreement, in particular that will enable the owners to maintain their home and the one related to the remuneration for managers of companies covered by the State.
When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of others, there is nothing to rejoice about.
But these measures are necessary - he commented on the American TV screen.
Interviewed on another channel to know if he will vote in favour of the plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied: - I would like to analyze the details, but I hope so -
\"As far as I've read, this is something that we all need to digest and that will allow us to move on\"
The option of a non-intervention is simply unacceptable - he said.
The 700 billion plan aims to re-purchas with taxpayers' money the debts, the risky and invincible assets of the American financial institutions.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis due to the outbreak of a real estate bubble that led first to the collapse of mortgage loans at risk (mutui ) , and then extends to other more widespread forms of credit securities (PCAA) and result in the freezing of liquidity and the disbandment of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republicans in charge to air the first draft of an agreement last week.
It seems to have come out of that blind alley since the Democrats agreed that the \"toxic\" asset of some companies in difficulty is only protected by the government, rather than purchased.
In order to meet with everyone at the Congress, a provision was made whereby, if the government were to cope with losses over the five years to come because of this programme, it could impose new taxes in order to maintain its balance.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion to which an additional 100 billion may be added if the President deems it necessary.
The payment of 350 billion should be ratified by a further vote of the Congress.
In exchange for his assistance, Washington will obtain shares of participation in the protected companies that will remove dividends in the event of profit and which can resale when the waters are calmed.
As set out in the plan, the federal government will have the possibility to delay the piping procedures for real estate loans and to set limits on remuneration and start-up allowances paid to the managers of the undertakings involved.
From today, the architects of the plan would like to submit it to the vote of the House of Representatives, and to the vote of the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all the efforts, it is not yet sure that their plan will be given free access.
In fact, there were several votes against the project yesterday, both in the republican and democratic elections.
\"Of course, Washington doesn't hear you,\" said Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House's Finance Committee, to his constituents.
- Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not to take advantage of taxpayers..
Leader of a small group at Congress, nicknamed the caucus of skeptics, the democratic representative Brad Sherman presents the situation differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred eminent professors of economics, including three Nobel Prizes, have written to us to say: we ask Congress not to draw quick conclusions and to carefully examine the way to be taken,” he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, we were once again witnessing the global nature of the crisis.
After an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion dollars).
The intervention by the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary when the French bank BNS Paribas indicated that it would have given up buying its competitor, in full bankruptcy after the loss of EUR 2 billion (US$ 2.9 billion) for the crisis in real estate loans at risk in the United States.
Fortis has 85 000 employees and is one of the twenty largest banks in Europe and the ten largest insurers.
\"It's not money lost,\" said Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
In contrast, influence and the right to vote in banking matters are collected.
It is certainly something that the savers and families now appreciate that the times are uncertain -
During this period, at the other end of the Channel, the British government seems to be in the process of nationalizing another bank in the bank for the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would charge itself with all the loans currently under way from the Bradford and Bringley bank, of which more than $41 billion ($75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it will be you to buy the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
Since the beginning of the economic crisis Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank, after Northern Rock, to undergo a nationalization process by the English government.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a busy icon
The beauty of the blue eyes was for a long time his ace in the sleeve, for others his weak point.
Did he get rid of the narcissistic mirror, the American actor from the sickening smile?
Yes and no.
His discretion, sensitivity and obvious talent would have expelled him from that circle of powerful consecrated to true sacred monsters.
That's rude.
Paul Newman, who disappeared on Friday, at the age of 83, in his Connecticut ranch, following lung cancer, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the past years.
Less monumental than Brando, to whom he resembled and for a long time was a sort of rival on the screen, more prudent in his game, certainly more fragile, but he also spoke of freedom and the development of dramatic beliefs.
Mixed couples often give birth to magical children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 as a German Jewish father and mother of Hungarian origins.
One of the glorious faces of the American dream will come from these European roots.
A humble ego, last quality brand.
As he recognized himself as a whole of an invaded country of the safe made man, of the fighter of the Pacific War, proud in the fight, which in the early 1950s studied dramatic art in Yale, he later attended the Actor Studio in New York, before triumphing in theatre, in television and early in the cinema.
The same militant man for civil rights was also the car driver who ranked according to the 24 hours of Mans in 1979, as well as sex symbol, although part of a model couple since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
They leave with him the shadow areas of a secret, discreet, committed, allergic star to the scandals of the show-business, of which the mystery will never be fully revealed.
An honest man, in the noblest sense of the term.
This weekend Paul Newman's disappearance was a dive to the heart for the cinemas, while his great characters populated the black screen of memories.
Over half a century of American cinema in full transformation is reproposed through its interpretations.
The charming cowboy of Butch Cassidy (1969) and that boy who was unable to wish the hot wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in La cat on the roof that bursts adapted by Tennessee Williams in 1958 are confused in his memory.
More recently, we remember it in the cloths of the sensitive Mr. Bridge (1990), upset by a marriage that did not keep as promised.
So many other Paul Newmans have gone to history.
The boxer Rocky Graziano, a criminal, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Lassù someone loves me, by Robert Wise, a role destined for James Dean and resumed after his death, which officially launched Newman in 1956.
That nice bad guy in the excellent Stangata, Oscar as the best movie in 1973.
Player of bitter and vindictive billiard in the Lo Spaccone, magnificent film by Robert Rossen (1961), The color of Martin Scorsese's money, which was worth him in 1987 the only oscar on 9 appointments.
That face over the years, it was hers.
Still him.
The eras occur through its path.
Young people know him above all for the cult movie Slap Shot- Dry Colpo by George Roy Hill (1977), in the role of Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in Mr. Hula Hoop, of the Coen brothers.
The circle had been closed with a final role as the godfather of the Irish Mafia in My Father's Era in 2003.
Unlike the greatest legends in the cinema that soon abandoned the trade, Newman will stay in the halls for a long time, reporting Hollywood in all its cover, parties and concessions.
Bertrand Tavernier, French filmmaker, defined it, with a hint of irony, a living challenge to underplaying, judging his performances exaggerated.
The profession has not always been a game for the beautiful Paul Newman, to which the roles seemed to fall like manna from the sky.
However, he often preferred the role of the outcast to that of the young actor: neurotic characters, alcoholized carrots or desperate, of which he expressed discontinuing and rebellion with his perfect traits.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown nuances of his true, pure sensitivity.
Jennifer's first time, 1968 (based on the Canadian novel Margaret Laurence), with Joanne Woodward's wife in the role of the protagonist, traced a thin female portrait of melanconia.
He, who lost his son Scott for an overdose, dedicated him in 1984 to the film Harry and Son, a discreet and sad film.
Among the countless tributes rained yesterday on Newman, his great friend and old gunmate Robert Redford (they recited together in La Stangata and Butch Cassidy) stated with infinite sadness - His presence made my life and this country better -
Generosity and love for life, two great characteristics of the missing actor.
Beyond a legend career, a great civil rights activist, ecology, independent cinema, and a Hollywood drift contestant are turned off.
We'll have his face blown out on bottles of vinegar, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging him as a choice of bad taste, although he was born as a gag.
However, the revenues of those sales were intended for its Children's Foundation in difficulty.
Newman, instead of leaning on his myth, chose to commit himself to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter that he was saying - Always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful to his good star.
Exercising, it was a privilege.
And it was also a privilege for us to follow the path of such a clear and generous American artist.
Model citizen, therefore, and much more.
What was produced in the invoice factory of Zuschlag & partners?
Soon, on 8 October, the hearing of the criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his associates will be discussed.
The political man and his associates are accused of repeated commercial fraud committed in the framework of a criminal association that has caused considerable damage, and other crimes, including forgery of documents.
According to the Procura the money obtained from competition bands, it was used by them for private purposes, and have often certified the performance of the activities through false invoices.
The state and municipal money, in total 65 million florins, ended in part in the caskets of the Fairal Baloldal organization, partly in the pockets of some people.
According to the method, made known by the investigating authorities, they have taken the money obtained from competition bands on the basis of invoices for non-existent transactions and the associations have never fulfilled their obligations.
According to the indictment, most of the invoices were false.
To do so, the invoice blocks were purchased at the market of Józsefváros, the circular stamps were manufactured in Kiskunulas.
And in order to decide on behalf of which to issue the invoices, it was established among other things during the trip between the hills above the Balaton where János Zuschlag had sent István Lados.
According to the confession of the latter he had to choose pensions and restaurants.
He asked for invoices for the consumption, on the model of these then were prepared the invoices to be sent to the competition bands, among others, to those of the Ministry for Youth and Sport, of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and of the Municipality of Budapest.
Most of these are the work of István Lados and András þri, who, according to our information, has primarily drawn up the reports needed to obtain funding.
One of the choices of Lados’ study travel was a brewery.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and its partners in 2003, the catering place provided meals for a group of 90 people from the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
But so many people, according to the restauranter, would not all enter the premises together.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, later known as Együtt at Harmadik Évezredert, pulls formal and content errors.
A pension of Badacsonytomaj has only three rooms, more than 10 people could not stay, however in the invoice there were 130 guests.
But the compilers of the fancy invoices exaggerated when they reported the Pigal Kft., this too deals with catering, in which accounting - according to the information issued to the judicial authorities - did not even appear the documents on behalf of the companies Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá.
Győző Farkas, company administrator, told hvg.hu that when he was summoned to the prosecutor and showed him the invoices, he immediately realized that it was false documents.
\"On stamp the name and the Iva game of our company were at a wrong point\"
He added: in addition to the formal reasons, there was no return to the fact that according to the invoice a hundred people were accommodated, when in total they have eleven rooms and there are not so many beds.
By the time the bill came, it was catering and their restaurant has been out of function for a long time.
The so-called invoice compilers did not worry about informing themselves that the Budapest travel agency from their choice, organizes only trips abroad, so they accidentally indicated on the invoice with payment in cash trips to Hungary, which did not agree with the company's invoice issuance practice.
Moreover, as demonstrated during the survey, the invoice also included Iva, while travel to countries outside the European Union is free of Iva.
Among other things, the amount of the Iva was incorrect on the four documents issued by the Hotel Revfülöp Kft. in favour of the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, in fact, on the services offered by the company it was necessary to apply the Iva to 15% and not to 25% as indicated on the invoices, in addition the hotel employees issued only printed invoices, while the invoice was handwritten.
In addition, the issuers have ruined other invoices, in the case of a company they have indicated as activities carried out the goods on the road, as can be seen from the Procurator's procedure, which was not carried out by the company originally founded for investment advice.
In addition, for formal defects - cause non-compliant invoice format, fake stamp - it has been found that invoices issued in favor of Együtt at Harmadik Évezredert Alapítvany, of XXI. Századi Kulturalis Egyesület and Biztos Pont are false.
The same happened in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehértó Sport Camp, whose representatives refused to issue the invoices in question.
The forgers did not even pay attention to the fact that the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in liquidation when (2001) had lunched you a group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület, precisely for this reason the manager of the company's liquidation, according to our information, refused to issue that invoice.
They have issued invoices knowingly
Another group of invoice issuers consists of those who were aware of having to issue fictitious invoices.
The Foundation Esély Budapestért Alapítvány has issued an invoice on request from Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták in favor of the Együtt Foundation at Harmadik Évezredert of almost 4 million florins.
Ludovic Györfi, one of the accused, according to the indictment, persuaded the director of Collab Kft. to issue fictional invoices.
He collaborated with Zuschlag and members also the Biogate Kft currently in liquidation, which in 2003 provided invoices issued for a value of about 5 million florins to the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány Foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület Association and the Vörösfenyő Egyesület Association, behind which there was no real economic activity.
Nor did money move because the prepared invoices were then distorted, but the associations forgot to make this look in their own documents.
In the following group of invoice issuers belong those who are related to the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov, authorized to the address of the Director General of the Delta Trió Kft, headquartered in Budapest but not available there, who deals with the trade in fuel and motor vehicles.
The company issued several invoices in October, November and December 2005 relating to the sale of IT vehicles, for a value of about 18 million guilders.
According to the investigation data, Kiskunalas's Cash Investment Kft has been under liquidation since 14 September 2005 purchased these invoices.
The general director of this company was a Romanian who between 2002 and 2005 Ivan Kubatov would have submitted the documents relating to the company.
As far as we know Kubatov, during the investigation, acknowledged that he had issued invoices on behalf of the company to Atlasz, Hoppá and Együtt to Harmadik Évezredert Alapítvány and the value was taken from him.
At the express request of Ivan Kubatov Romanian murals founded Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
However, none of the firms were operational, because according to the defendant they had not received work.
However, the companies became useful because, at the request of the co-invoiced lawyer Zsolt Szente, editor of the company's founding documents, invoices were issued to the associations linked to Zuschlag: Atlasz and Y-Generació.
On behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade Kubatov has issued 15 invoices to the various entities for a total value of 14.2 million florins.
The Prosecutor considers that Kubatov has intruded 10% of the amounts shown on invoices, as well as Iva.
The man also used the Szi-Beri Bt. to issue fictitious invoices, manufactured for the contest ban of Biztos Pont.
Y-Generació and Szövetség in Modern Magyarországért in January 2006 presented a ban on the public utility institution of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapitvány (TMA).
They also won 500,000 florins on their heads but the sums were not used for the purposes indicated in the ban.
To avoid this, they presented to the TMA five fictional invoices received by the Works Team Kft.
These invoices were found during the search of the Árpád Kemecsei office at the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing a portion of the defendants, as they have already done in the prosecutor's office, will probably report the development of the production of invoices.
However the most interesting thing could be if the defendant number one, János Zuschlag, would decide to raise the veil on everything.
His confession so far has not been very detailed and even though he has promised to speak more and more extensively, he has not yet done so.
We need to see if it is in his interest, it may also be possible that the socialists have made agreements with Zusi, which - in exchange for a compensation of 50 million florins, much of the damage - would be willing to make the scapegoat.
Zuschlag could have been offended by the fact that his requests for relief from his prison conditions, that is, the granting of house arrests, have not yet been heard.
While the perpetrators of non-responsible commercial offences and causing much greater damage may freely pass or at least wait at home for the end of the proceedings against them, which is not granted to him.
The psychology of bidding in excess: why spend more money?
Buyers are willing to spend more on auctions, to overestimate the goods.
Neurologists and researchers at the University of New York have been able to discover the neuro-economic bases of this known and apparently irrational behavior.
According to their study published in the journal Science men do not want to stay back in a race such as eBay auction, so they are available to pay even a higher price.
The research sought to trace the nervous pattern of this part of the nervous system through experimental astements.
One group of volunteers played the lot, the other group of players participated in an auction while using the functional magnetic resonance method (fMRI) examined the active areas of the brain of the participants in the experiment.
In both games the participants could win money, but in the auction game, in which the substantial element is to bid more than the other, the body striated under the cerebral cortex comes intensively into operation when you lose the game.
This brain area, in addition to other functions, plays a role in the mechanism of self-gratification of the nervous system.
Therefore, according to researchers, the rise of the price is explained by scanning the vehemently reaction of the striato body.
To support their theory, the economists of the research group conducted a financial follow-up investigation.
In this investigation, three groups have tendered against a partner under different conditions.
The control group reported on the actual value of the product in question and made their bets.
To another group besides this they promised that in the case of winning they will receive another $15 prize.
The third group would have received 15 dollars before the auction, but the members of the group would have lost the money in the event of a loss on the auction.
The difference between the two groups consisted in the fact that for one of them the win was emphasized, while for the other the loss.
By checking the hypothesis of the neurologists the members of the group that played - against the loss - were willing to make higher bets of the control group or - winning -
These results are not deductible from any of the previously existing economic theories.
In fact, these so far explained the phenomena encountered in auctions with the joy of winning and avoiding risk.
Only the methods of creating the neurological image have helped to resolve the contradiction between the two theories, so that we have come to a third explanation - said Andrew Schotter, professor of the Faculty of Economics of the University of New York.
Hepatitis: when do you contact your doctor?
Almost half a billion people in the world suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, in Hungary, chronic liver diseases are mentioned among the first causes of death.
In Hungary, the number of hepatitis sufferers amounts to one hundred thousand, of which only 7000 are treated: the reason is that many patients do not know how to be infected.
Hepatitis is the collective name of contagious liver disease caused by different viruses.
There are many similarities between symptoms, typical of hepatitis and jaundice, but their pathogenic agents and caused diseases differ from one another.
Hepatitis viruses are spread in two main forms depending on the pathogenic agent: hepatitis A and E through the food channel (e.g. water and food), hepatitis B, C, D and other blood viruses and organic fluids (sperm, vaginal losses, saliva).
For those travelling it is useful to immunize against A and B virus, against C there is no vaccine.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear two-three weeks after eating infected foods, accompanied by general malaise, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After yellow spots are formed on the skin and on the white of the eyes, the faeces become clear and the dark urine, the healing takes place in two-three weeks.
A million people die every year worldwide for hepatitis B, the most serious variant of the disease, which causes liver tumors and liver cirrhosis.
The main reason is, according to estimates, that only one in ten persons receive pharmacological treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if it is not treated it can cause liver cirrhosis and tumors.
Most infected people do not know that they have contracted the disease because pathogens subdolently destroy liver cells, in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
Therefore, it is very important to prevent and carry out regular medical tests.
This disease is much more common than the average in three groups: those who had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts and tattoos.
Today in the world the number of people infected with chronic hepatitis C virus amounts to 200 million.
Since a routine laboratory examination also reveals that the disease is worth addressing the family doctor when you notice any symptoms of unknown origin.
Recognized in time the disease is curable, the virus can be eliminated by the organism, so ceases the infectious power and can be prevented the formation of tumors.
September 30 is the world day of hepatitis, organized for the first time in 2004 by disease associations worldwide.
The aim is to draw attention to chronic viral hepatitis, the causes of its development and early recognition of the disease.
Who believes in God feels less pain?
According to the result of a recent investigation, religious faith functions as a sort of painkiller that made the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
Scientists at Oxford University carried out an interesting experiment, examining how faith in God influences the feeling of pain, the British Telegraph reported.
Within the framework of the rather bizarre investigation, an electroshock was carried out with 12 Catholic believers and with as many atheists, while all observed a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
Based on the results, Catholic believers were able to reject much of the pain.
Thanks to the exploratory technique of the human brain it was discovered that Catholics were able to activate the part of the brain responsible for the control of pain.
The test is the first of a series of research in which, in addition to academics, scientists, philosophers and theologians of the University also take part.
The test was carried out exactly this way: a tool that emits discharges and passes the electroshock was connected to the left hand of the experiment subject.
The researchers asked the participants to focus on two paintings, the Virgin Mary painted in the 17th century by Sassoferrato and the Lady with Leonardo da Vinci's hermellin painted in the 15th century.
The authors of the exam hoped that the image of the Virgin Mary would originate a sort of religious state among the believers, while Leonardo's painting was chosen because it did not differ too much from the other and they considered it to be a reassuring effect.
The subjects of the experiment spent half an hour in front of the MRI scanner and in this time period they received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive series, while observing or painting on religious theme or the other.
Catholics reported that the vision of the Virgin Mary made them feel \"safe\" as if \"someone took care\" of them and \"they were calmed down and were pervaded by peace\"
Looking at the religious image, they realized 12% less pain than they had before them the work of Leonardo.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who took part in the test himself, believes that such a result can be achieved with any image with a strong effect even for atheists, but we must find the image suitable.
\"We must look for an image to which very positive feelings, like a mother or a father,\" said the psychologist.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright was pleased with the result of the search.
“The practice of faith should change, and in many cases it manages to change our personality,” Wright added.
After the excellent results, only the question remains if the painting of a Madonna of Leonardo or another painter of the same caliber is presented to the believers, what effect could it have on the control of pain?
Would the vision of a virgin Mary of quality bring better results?
You're what you say about yourself.
On the day of the tenth birthday Google can claim to be in the pockets of people as well as the sky above their heads; it knows where they spent the holidays, what ambulatory they attend and what interests them.
This, however, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the directors of the company, is not enough yet.
What about the sceptics that compare with the Orwellian nightmare, they do not see the substance of the web 2.0.
Recently Eric Schmidt told the Financial Times that Google's main purpose is to collect as many personal data from its users as possible and this is necessary to meet the original goal of Google's founders as it was: \"we insert all the information in the world into a system.\"
According to Google's director interviewed the company, after 10 years of revolutionary work, it is still at the beginning of being able to manage all the information.
To the question what will happen in five years Schmidt replied: he would like if Google knew how to answer questions like - what I do tomorrow - or - what would be the right job for me, but software does not know how to answer seemingly simple questions because they don't know enough about users.
Not all users are aware that exactly the words they search for during their internet searches are recorded, from which IP address they are searched for, and on which page they stop those interested after the search.
Through the Personalized Search started two years ago users e.g. can memorize their browsing history, they can relate to what they have searched for and clicked, these then long go will generate results to a much better extent; on this same logic it is based Recommendations with which the system offers us products and services according to our previously declared and registered preferences.
What happens if my data is used against me, if they look at what I do? - they ask the concerned users of Google data monopoly.
In most cases, the counterreactions of the internauts are caused by the fear proved by the size of the potential power represented by the company, and not by the sense of guilt, by the fear of punishment, by the desire for freedom or even by the rebellion to power.
One fact, however, is confirmed that all expressions sought are not only recorded but in motivated cases can also be provided to third parties, in such legal cases there is nothing to defend the personal rights of the residents.
The most striking example of this in recent times was perhaps the coordinated action against the paedophiles of Brazil, in which Google has forwarded to the Brazilian government the information that made possible the identification of the pedophiles from the page of the Orkut community maintained by Google.
The inmates concerned about personal rights instead were relieved in May when the company - in agreement with the EFF e-legal protection association - has successfully demonstrated the truth in court against the FBI: even later Google cannot be forced with any point of the constitution to provide any information specifically requested by the FBI.
(At the same time the federal government successfully ripped down nearly 50,000 web addresses and thousands of research expressions obtained in connection with the confirmation of the child protection law passed years earlier, but nevertheless failed to obtain the individual users' search lists and the entire list of web pages and keywords dating back to two months.)
Google's judgment is therefore quite contradictory: those who fear to provide their personal data differ Google because they believe that in this way their intimate sphere and private life are being affected by the use of their services and raise themselves with the rebellion of the multinationals that stand out for the conservative image.
Meanwhile, American geek culture and the proliferation of computer enthusiasts, activists and users in many countries see in them the future generation of big firms, the \"cool corporation\" unlike their rival, Microsoft liquidated as the world's conqueror because of Windows, however they both fight for the same goal.
This can happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for an identification code, does not ask for money for its services, the source code always kept up-to-date and the program package is much more accessible, young and cool than the official practice of the software colossus.
But it can also happen because geeks see exactly the problematic relationship between personal rights and the internet, which involves just one of the most frequently repeated keywords in recent years, web 2.0.
Web 2.0 speaks only of collaboration, of intentionally leaving traces behind us and exploiting communication channels at our disposal and while the size of these changes for each individual, the substance is the same: to show ourselves.
A young average can create profiles in multiple community pages, from Facebook to Shanghai, you can connect them with other services such as Twitter or last.fm that lists your musical tastes, all of which can be inserted into systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, you can also write blogs about which automatically appear your latest photo galleries stored on Flickr or Picasa.
Meanwhile, we read of numerous exemplary cases from which it is clear that the girl, seeing the series of photos taken in the morning by the common tour of friends, comes to know easily with whom she spent the night her perfide boy or a company can fire her employee because she has written a sincere opinion on the company summit: one thing is sure, the concept of private life has now been completely reconsidered.
Those who live an online life make it possible to show themselves and so we can formulate the fundamental thesis that is hidden behind the behavior of young people.
On the other hand, anyone who wants to hide something or only wants to avoid Google's monopoly can do so (e.g. by starting with Scroogle using Google's search system but at the same time does not leave traces voluntarily).
There are few people who do not register on purpose to community pages for not being found, Google's online applications, from text processing to image management and news collection, can be replaced with alternative versions not related to huge server parks and that do not make up our best existing profile so far.
Public opinion does not wait as much in secret for the moment when Google will pull out its arms.
Currently, the company with its $156 billion worth worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising spaces threaten the revenues of advertising agencies, record-time services cause major malaises not only to Microsoft but also to numerous software development firms.
However, critical observers next to all this find some warning points: the company summit for example completely rejected the employee protest after doubling the corporate asylum line, considered it too costly the repeated daily restaurantation of employees, all of which decreases in the fact that in 2006 Google broke the head of the Chinese government and according to their agreement the company will filter all the results that offend the good taste and interests of the Chinese regime.
An internal rule of the company seems to be not to advertise a new service in advance but only when it will be usable, however, one thing is certain, that the foreseeable problems of the coming months and years will move the world at one point: while some believe that the project of scanning and storing Google books and magazines will take on such proportions that the firm will soon find itself in front of the U.S. Supreme Court, others are afraid of the health system, since in this we can create a health profile with our references, doctors and problems.
The fact that Google is building a genetic database can offer good material to the next generation of science writers, the story Scrogled by the famous Cory Doctorow describes the future with orwellian accents, in which a man with Google data can be approached in an alarming way.
Two minors helped Ozd's double murder disappear.
The police questioned two minors regarding the double murder of Ozd, suspected of having helped to clear the traces of the crime - said the spokesman for the Borsod Region Police Complaint Tuesday.
Young people have recognized the crime against them, and they are currently accused of favouring them.
The two minors, two girls according to MTI information, defend themselves on a free foot basis.
The favour can be punished for up to 5 years of imprisonment.
The suspect of the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old local man, was put in pretrial detention on Sunday.
He's suspected of a premeditated multiple murder committed for profit.
It turned out from the investigation that the 20th-year-old had a big debt with a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to pay the debt, for this reason last Wednesday attracted with a deception his creditor in a construction site of Ozd where he and his daughter of nine years were killed.
According to MTI information the young man had prepared to commit the crime, a signal is that he committed the murder with a weapon hidden on the spot.
The police are examining the weapon and circumstances of use with the involvement of an expert.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange made an offer for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered 200 million euros, about 5 billion Czech crowns, for the purchase of 100% of the stock list of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwig Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer advanced by the Poles despite the Czechs having previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange as a possible buyer of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for the exclusion is the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is owned by the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state which intends to sell over a few months more than 60% of its securities.
The Czech financial journal E15 states that the offer of the Poles represents the highest figure so far advanced for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the German Stock Exchange have submitted an offer.
Petr Koblic, director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among all those interested the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst owner and did not exclude that this could lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange in 5-10 billion crowns.
According to the shareholders' agreement, almost 90% of the securities would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Finance Land with a share of almost 25%, followed by the Bank Česká Spořitelna with 14.7% and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5%
The economic crisis from the point of view of European newspapers
The main European newspapers in their Tuesday comments on the international economic crisis already speak of a second 11 September.
The global financial disaster was due to the American President - accused La Repubblica - who was unable to compact his party behind a law that was soon dulled, whose aim is to remedy a desperate situation.
Instead of a second Pearl Harbour, as the billionaire Warren Buffett said, it would be more accurate to speak of a second 11 September.
Also part of the Madrid press sees in Washington the scapegoat.
According to El Mundo the lack of American political guidance has thrown the world economy on the edge of the coffin.
The danger of the collapse of the American financial system is growing, and this will suffer the whole world later.
Bush's plan was not perfect but as a result of the Congress vote there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political means of managing the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air, just when the most transformation of the history of capitalism is taking place.
It is no longer possible to release the threat - it mentions the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva.
Some states today can still offer a lifesaver to the financial institutions boating and with taxpayers' money can save them from failure.
But if more and more banks collapse as in a domino effect then it will not be enough either the financial means or new improvised solutions.
In the long term, it is necessary for the Member States of the European Union to overcome their national selfishness and to concentrate control on the financial markets which have been dismembered.
Only Monday, the weakened financial institutions have received more than 100 billion euros - it recalls the Venetian Der Standard, according to which the anxiety that European taxpayers, like Americans, also seem to be more real, will have to turn to their portfolio to remedy the crisis.
The EU has not so far been very concerned about the crisis that has crossed the old continent like a tsunami.
The \"salvators\" should not immediately unwind the EUR 100 billion, however it would be better if they established in which case the taxpayers' money should be tapped to prevent larger damage.
Smart machine mimics calabron flight
What could be the best way to develop anti-collition technologies if you do not imitate the sensors of the obstacles in nature?
For example, bees.
In the amazing project presented to the CETAEC in Japan, the calabron gave the initial strategic trigger to Nissan engineers on how to build the next generation of anti-lock systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the biomimetic robot BR23C, a robotized mini-car with bees properties, with the ultimate aim of creating a system able to scan all collisions.
Flying the bees form a personal oval space that really resembles our protective shield - explained to the exhibition Kazuhiro Doi, director of PR technology and research and development.
Important is the role of the ape view, capable of a view of 300 degrees in each direction.
Engineers have drawn to the telemetric laser idea to copy the function of the ape view.
The BR23C detects the obstacles up to two meters away within a 180 degree radius, calculates the distance and sends a signal to the onboard microprocessor that immediately transforms it into a command to avoid collision.
In a fraction of a second the robot perceives the obstacle and then, imitating the movements of the ape, changes direction immediately by turning the wheels of the measure necessary to avoid the accident.
This avoidance maneuver, unlike the current system, is carried out in a completely instinctive manner.
“If it wasn’t so, the robot car wouldn’t be able to react quickly to avoid collisions,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the auto robot project.
It must react instinctively and immediately because this technology corresponds to the harmful layer and more internal than the protective shield, within which the collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what a bee does to avoid the other bees.
This process must take place in an eye beater.
But unlike bees the deviation cannot go up or down or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional and in the direction of steering wheels.
In this way, instead of the infinite possibilities available for bees to scan the other bees, the robot, as a possibility available, can rotate on itself, accelerate and slow down.
The BR23C is powered by batteries to lithium polymers, lighter and with high energy density, which means that their duration is greater than those of lithium ions.
According to Andoh it is important the instantaneity of the intelligent reaction, not the processing of data or even less the ability to store them.
This robot must process some inputs in a few seconds and react.
There is no need to memorize and react with intuitive logic based on previous manoeuvring data, so it uses only a memory of a few tens of Kb.
No need for a memory of gigabytes or megabytes.
This is the first step towards the development of a technology for the immediate avoidance of collisions that, for Nissan, within 10 years can be installed on standard vehicles.
Further application possibilities can be represented by unification with GPS satellite navigation system that avoids obstacles on the road leads to destination.

The written version of the $70 billion Economic Rescue Act for the purchase of disproportionate credits has been drawn up, to be applied in several parts.
In the first passage, half of the sum is spent.
In the new agreements protracted up to midnight on Saturday according to the Eastern Coast time, the leaders of the congress decided to save 700 billion dollars after a debate lasting for days - Reuters reported.
We have taken serious steps forward - Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President of the American House of Representatives said that she has only remained to put the agreement on paper.
Both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain, supported the plan's compromise.
The Treasury Minister Henry Paulson talking about the outcome of the compromise said: the program will work and it will be effective, but there is still much to be done. According to Pelosi it is not the rescue of Wall Street but the reversal of the economic car.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of the Asian markets at 8 a.m. in Washington time (2 p.m. on Monday according to the time of Central Europe), but did not bring a great growth in the stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will first vote on the project defined Economic Stabilization Act 2008 concerning the program, after which it will touch the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke on Saturday night with Pelosi, then he welcomed the White House with joy the news of the agreement.
We are pleased with the progress achieved tonight and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and defend the economy - said Tony Fratto spokesperson of the White House.
However, the programme differs from the Bush administration's original proposal, which provided that the $700 billion would all be spent for the purchase of securities with disproportionate credits behind them.
Now as a first step you will be able to spend as much as half of the sum of $700 billion, $250 billion immediately after the Congress's Monday vote, with these, the Treasury Ministry will buy securities with disproportionate credits behind, the fate of the remaining $100 billion will decide the president.
A special college will control the program to which the President of the Federal Reserve also takes part.
The expenditure of the other half of the 700 billion depends on a new Congress decree.
Under the law, the Ministry of Treasury may apply a combined tactic: it can purchase at the same time credits, mortgages and securities with mortgages and other types of loans -veiled
The purchase can take place through auctions and in a direct manner - they have announced the competent authorities of the ministry.
The legal rule makes it possible for the companies concerned to take part in an insurance programme where the Treasury Ministry guarantees the means that give concern, for which the companies will pay a price appropriate to the likely damage.
Henrz Paulson said: the law provides the necessary means for 700 billion dollars to come to the urgent needs of the American monetary system, whether it is the purchase of the wrong financial means, or their insurance or to avoid the risk of the collapse of a large financial institution.
We will take all necessary steps to get ourselves ready to introduce the law just signed - added.
The directors of the banks in crisis and awaiting state aid think instead that the government will limit their success, defined by the slang of overseas simply as gold parachutes.
The limitations of payments will only occur in some cases, and the limitations also depend on how the Treasury Ministry will offer the aid.
In essence, the limitation means that if the Ministry buys in an auction, it will impose an overcrowding on the gold parachute, unless the deceased bank manager is retired.
At the time of the direct purchase of disproportionate credits the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the money of directors is not exaggerated.
In addition, the existing gold parachute contracts will not change, the limitation is only valid for new ones to encourage participation in the programme.
This is the first case in the American history of the entry into force of a legal limitation concerning the remuneration of the general administrators - commented on the provision of the democratic Barney Frank chairman of the committee responsible for the financial services of the House of Representatives.
In addition, the state has the right to take advantage of a share of the banks participating in the programme, reducing the risk of taxpayers, since in the end they can also earn us if the economy, and together with it the bank saved, will stand again.
The proposed law includes that in the next five years the President must submit to Congress a proposal which has the means of restoring to taxpayers the expected losses arising from the financial sector.
Of course, on both sides there were those who expressed their doubts about the project.
This is not what American citizens have asked us not to defend taxpayers' dollars - said the Republican Member of California Darrell Issa.
His democratic colleague of Ohio Mary Kaptur believes that the measures have been taken by the same ones who are responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

The prices of paper production, publishing and printing activities have not changed.
In the other sectors of the manufacturing industry there was an increase in prices between 0.2 and 0.9%.
In the field of supply of electricity, gas, steam and water prices increased in August by 0.3% in national industrial sales, first of all as a result of the dominant effect of the increase in the price of gas made by the authorities since 1 July.
Compared in 12 months, given the national sales of the manufacturing industry, the major increases were in the oil processing sector (32.4%).
In the manufacture of products from metal processing, the price increase was 13.2%, 11% in the production of food, drink and tobacco representing a decisive weight.
A decrease in prices occurred in the textile sector (2.5%) and in the production of electrical instruments and machinery (0.3%).

Next year in the United States without a visa?
Kinga Göncz sees the possibility that about 12 January the American-Hungarian visa-free agreement could enter into force - the Foreign Minister spoke about this in Chicago with the Hungarian representatives of the place.
According to his opinion - now everything depends on the fact that overseas seats are built in time the electronic system of entry and control -
However, it drew attention to the fact that in the new system there will no longer be permission to enter, however before departure tourists will have to be registered.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy will continue negotiations in Washington today.
He will meet with Foreign Minister Condoleeza Rice, to whom he will give the Medal of the Hungarian Order Cross with the Star and will engage with foreign policy advisers of Democratic candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and John McCain also joined the bank rescue plan
Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates for the two major American parties, have guaranteed their support for the 700 billion dollar government plan for saving banks on Sunday, but there are politicians who claim resignation from the Treasury Minister.
The representatives of Congress and the administration after the marathon negotiations lasted for days, Sunday night announced that they had reached an agreement in principle on the rescue plan of the banks.
The Wall Street crisis and the financial package for clearing the frozen claims market have become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain want to be more appropriate than their rival to bring the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent surveys with the development of the economic issues Obama once again recovered a bit of advantage, while McCain’s advantage, obtained after the Republican convention with the appointment of vice president of Sarah Palin, has disappeared.
Obama in a speech to Detroit expressed hope that the congress would quickly approve the 700 billion dollar plan.
He stressed that the proposal contains those consumer protection steps which were supported by him as well.
\"Now we must act responsibly (...), the danger threatens your work, your savings, all industrial sectors, complete economic stability,\" said a crowd of 35,000 people.
McCain's economic ideas were not left out of the question.
McCain in an interview with the ABC explained that all of us who are going to send this situation down with difficulty (...) but not doing anything is not a road to go -
The Republican senator reported that the proposal included the creation of a supervisory committee of the Minister of Finance and the limitation of the good outputs of top managers, which he insisted on.
Obama told the CBS that McCain did not have a meaningful role in the agreements, but he was in daily contact with the minister.
President Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that the House of Representatives will probably vote on the bill on Monday.
Press release of the German-speaking world
The pole on the right is intact, only inside the pole the voters have become more self-aware - thus analyzes Der Spiegel the weak result of CSU in Bavaria.
Haider's party is ready to rule Austria to prevent the red-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spigel.de)
Franz Walter, in the internet edition of the German Left Magazine, in the article The Bavarian Revolution devours its parents analyze the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known polytologist, the erosion of the CSU started long before the sad Beckstein-Huber couple came into office.
Christians-socials have modernized Bavaria for decades and these modern citizens are now moving away from them.
The change of time is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, as well as Angela Merker.
The defeat was not a great surprise for the CSU, but on Sunday it ended a process that exactly ten years ago had been feasible: it ended the undisputed hegemony of a party-state.
Already 10 years ago, in 1998, the CSU had fallen to 47.7%, for the first time under the 50% threshold since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago at the Bundestag elections in 2005 still in the period of the so-called Stoiber.
The reason for this is the subsequent modernization in the region, which devours parents.
Sociologists have predicted it already 40 years ago, but they have made a lot of mistakes in time. But secularization, the results of education, the settlement of East and North Germans in the developed Bavarian region could not remain without consequences on the loyalty of voters to the CSU.
Modernisation goes hand in hand with increased possibilities and the political consequences are evident.
The pole on the right is intact, only inside the pole the voters have become more aware, critical, obstinate cars.
It is also surprising that in the last few weeks, the classic bourgeois groups — the free professionals, craftsmen, diplomats and graduates — have departed from the CSU.
Support for CSU has fallen below 40% here.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The Viennese Conservative newspaper - Who with whom - In the article - The party presidents are blocked in coalition issues - deals with the confused Austrian internal political situation created following the elections.
SPÖ intends to deal with ÖVP.
ÖVP prohibits intervention by SPÖ in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ shows itself open to negotiations in all directions, the Greens still do not want to discuss coalition.
The elections were made, it now revolves all around the coalition; in the discussion broadcast by the public TV the party leaders just showed the cards.
Werner Faymann President of SPÖ confirmed that he wanted to deal with ÖVP.
SPÖ wants to demonstrate that cooperation between the two parties, in some regions and in social partnership already exists.
Faymann left the question open if he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of ÖVP, as vice-cancellier.
As he said, the Schüssel-Molterer course was in any case rejected.
The repetition of this direction is not considered.
Manyer has reacted prudently to the red offers.
As you said, collaboration will certainly not succeed if Faymann tries to interfere in ÖVP's internal affairs.
If your party chooses the opposition or enters the coalition it is still an open thing in the party, the issues must be discussed in any case within the ÖVP.
Jörg Haider leader of BZÖ repeated to be opened in all directions.
\"To prevent the red-black coalition, we are ready to assume the responsibility of governing,\" said Haider.
Jaróka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, in Paris, the European Summit for the Equal Opportunities started, organized this year by France with the European Union's presidency.
Lívia Járóka, Member of the European People's Party Fidesz in the message addressed to the plenary as the principal rapporteur of the congress, drew attention to the school segregation because it is the most serious legal violation that affects Roma children and to reach the most serious obstacle to their affirmation.
Xavier Bertrand French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, on behalf of the French Presidency, and European Commissioner Vladimir Špidla responsible for employment, social affairs and equal opportunities opened the conference at the highest level.
Among those invited to the conference were governments, European social partners and representatives of the major European civil and rights organisations in equal opportunities.
Járóka, according to the press office of the Fidesz PE Group, recalled, in addition to discrimination in the recruitments, that the Roma are expelled from the labour market in the first place because of their low schooling.
‘Most Roma youth are not entitled to a medium-level study and as a result of elementary education of poor quality only an irresorious number of them can reach a higher degree of study’
Járóka also stressed, as a fundamental human right, the key role of education in the realization of human rights.
Investing in the education of Roma children can mean strengthening the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the Member, it is necessary to make aware of these links in the wider area between the Roma and the non- Roma.
In fact, as soon as a Roma school begins, its chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market are increased, with taxes paid for income and consumption contributing to the nation's budget.
\"The right of European Roma citizenship must guarantee their right to a quality education and the elimination of low-level and segregated schools,\" said Lívia Járóka.
According to the Member, it is necessary to bring together the purpose and action of the European Union in order to speed up the process of disintegration of schools, and therefore it is vital that the right respect for existing and designed anti-discrimination directives be respected.
\"The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be interrupted, Roma children must be given the opportunities afforded by the democratic space so that they can contribute as full citizens in the future of Europe,\" Járóka asked.
In the sign of the \"European Year of Equal Opportunities\" to be guaranteed for all, the aim of the European Summit for Equal Opportunities organised annually, at the Berlin meeting last year is to ensure a single forum to promote the objectives of anti-discrimination and equal opportunities set at the state and European level.
CSU: pity for a transitional period
At the end of October, you will decide the fate of the impassioned Huber-Beckstein couple.
Despite the bad electoral defeat the heads have not yet fallen, at the summits of the Bavarian CSU the discussion of personal issues has been postponed for the time being.
The president of the Erwin Huber Party and the regional governor Günther Beckstein remain in their place, the question is as long as the piety lasts.
The fate of the tandem that has suffered a catastrophic loss of votes of 17% will decide the party's extraordinary congress on the last weekend of October.
The two highly criticized politicians have in any case reported not being attacked with all the forces at the chair.
They have thus tried to soften the angry members of the parliamentary group and the base that one day after the Bavarian tsunamis have claimed the personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
5 years ago, under the guidance of Edmund Stoiber at the end of his career, the Christian-Social Union obtained 60.7%, now after the coup against Stoiber fell to 43.4%.
The CSU for 46 years was an absolute monarch in Bavaria, which gives 18% of the German GDP.
However, the conservatives in the southern region are always of fundamental importance to the Hungarian economy, and in the future they will be forced in every way to become a coalition.
As the first sign of the reorganisation within the party the Federal Vice-President and Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, considered as a legacy of Huber, obtains a place in the narrow exploratory group that will begin negotiations with the FDP Liberals and with the Right-wing Free Electors for a possible governmental coalition in Munich.
For a strange joke of fate in the list of Free Electors, Gabriele Pauli enters the legislature whose attitude against Stoiber had been exploited as a coup opportunity by the Huber-Beckstein couple and then treats the woman without regard for the great ambitions.
CSU leaders now concentrate all their forces to stabilize Beckstein in some way.
In the meantime, Stoiber will also be playing an active role, which he had been playing in the shadow so far. The former regional governor and former president of the CSU defined on 28 September the most bitter day of his political career.
On Monday Huber issued some statements to the faithful to the CSU, according to which they would have deserved more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
Merkel will not be able to be chancellor after the elections of the Bundestag set for September 2009 if it will not be re-established with common forces the CSU that has played a decisive role in the national victory of 2005.
According to Merkel, which does not hide disappointment for the fiasco, the loss of land of the CSU will not negatively affect the great coalition of Berlin.
What is of course relative: it will not be easy to manage the CSU wound, the crisis of the Social Democrats still lasts.
The SPD reached its lowest result since 1946 in Bavaria with 18.6%.
Lukashenko-opposition: 110-0
Not even a representative of the opposition entered the Belarusian Parliament after the Sunday elections.
According to Russian observers, it is the sign of the well-being and stability ensured in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) instead explains with the broilers made in counting the votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the elections.
Although the legislation of 110 people from a country of 10 million inhabitants has been unopposed for more than a decade before yesterday's elections, the opposition gathered under the name United Democratic Forces (ODS) was seriously hoping that Lukashenko, with the presidential mandate renewed for the fourth time following the constitutional amendment to the 2006 elections held under disputed circumstances, had given Parliament some seats to opposition representatives.
The ODS has thus renounced a previously assessed boycott.
Behind the expectations of the opposition was that Belarus, increasingly economically dependent on Russia, which called for a credit to reduce the import of increasingly expensive Russian natural gas and agreed to give the Russians the gas pipelines owned by Beltransgaz that cross the country, intended to improve the relationship with the EU where Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians cannot enter due to the Belarusian political situation considered anti-democratic.
He referred to a distension that the OSCE in assessing the electoral campaign placed the emphasis on positive movements and not on shortcomings, such as the prohibition to appear for a third of the opposition's candidates.
However, the OSCE's speedy Monday report also criticized the campaign, during which the candidates for the opposition in practice could not appear on the press, and in particular that the opposition could not be present in counting the votes.
Even so, according to the opposition, an improvement is perceived in the political climate: political prisoners were released, Minsk is also prepared for a small confrontation with Moscow, continuing to deny the recognition of the South Ossetia and Abkhazia from Georgia, even though Russia, with which Belarus forms a federal state on paper, considers the two countries independent for a month already.
We have made two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun - it has told our newspaper Aleksandr Milinkevich.
According to the presidential candidate for the 2006 elections, it is desirable that it remain despite the fact that - the power has been afraid to bring even one opponent into a Parliament without weight -
The opposition does not provide protest actions for the results, but rather tries to get the voters to feel the message of the need for economic reforms.
Of course we have many problems, we have to print the opposition newspapers in Russia, for distribution the local authorities raise difficulties, but also so I see that more and more people support change, even among the elderly - Milinkevich said regarding the fact that not even the officially most aided cetum, that of the pensioners, believes the Lukashenko regime that its main result is the creation of social security.
Because of the country's indebtedness and the increase in economic deficit it is only a matter of time the breakdown of social security, which recalls the secular silence, says Milinkevich.
On the contrary of the opposition's policy, the Russian observers considered the elections democratic.
Sergej Lebedev President of the Community Independent States said to the Russian press agency RIA Novosti: \"Men believe not in words but in facts - so the lack of opposition is nothing but proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: \"From now on breakfast before work\"
It never happened in the history of Palazzo Chigi that there were rotating doors for the entrance and exit of the employees.
But since today he has taken this new measure against the sneakers, against whom he screams and then goes to drink a coffee at the bar at work time.
The antifannulloni news was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
The swivel doors - says Brunetta - are a tool for working better, with more productivity, more presence and more services - the minister says.
-Now a new season of responsibility and transparency opens.
This is reformism - Brunetta still emphasizes.
With Palazzo Chigi we complete the installation in all the buildings of the Presidency of the Council.
For Masi - the choice of rotating doors is also important from a symbolic point of view -
There were no resistances from employees, he assured the Secretary-General: \"It was a process shared by the workers and there was the collaboration of all\"
I mean, no more breakfast at work time; no more coffee and cornetto.
The Word of Brunetta, which suggests, smiling, a beautiful cappuccino at 7 in the morning is a holy hand.
During a conference at the Higher School of Public Administration
in Rome, the minister then makes it known that in three months the absences for public employees' disease have decreased by 50%, i.e. 60 thousand more people to work in one year -
It adds that it is necessary to make the Public Administration more efficient
Italian, whose wage dynamics - explains the minister - in the last 8-10 years have been double compared to the private sector and well above the inflation rates -
Meanwhile, thousands of public employees joined together to challenge the rules of the Brunetta decree by adhering to the appeal supported by the Codacons.
\"While the Minister of Public Service is today releasing numbers about the lower absenteeism at work because of illness - writes the association of consumers - the people of 'operable children' is constantly growing.
In fact, there are thousands of employees in Italy of the correct and productive public administration who have joined together to declare war against the illegitimate rules contained in the decree -
In particular, the Tar will contest the exclusion of additional economic treatments for dependent sickness due to service; the extension of the hours of repermissibility of the sick worker, within which the checks are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions of the Minister.
Labour Incidents, Napolitano: -Criminal Prevention -
Every day, in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur at work, 3 people die and 27 remain permanently invalid.
For 2007, Inail data confirm that white deaths were about 1,200.
Figures that testify to the seriousness of a phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice as many deaths as in homicides.
In order to draw the attention of institutions, social forces and media to this dramatic issue, Anmil today celebrates the 58th National Day for Victims of Accidents at Work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
“The worrying data published by Anmil and the same tragic chronics of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is,” said the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the President of Anmil, National Association mutilated and disabled of work, Pietro Merandelli.
The Head of State expresses his deep appreciation for the continuing commitment to prevention in the workplace, the protection of unlucky workers, the assistance of families of victims and the awareness of public opinion.
\"It has, of course, lifted up an indignant 'quite', sincerely shared, in the face of tragedies which, because of their size, arouse the cry of the media and the involvement of the public opinion but the daily reality challenges dramatic, even repetitive, cases in their dynamics.\"
Napolitano does not hide that there is undoubtedly also a resource problem: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
Particularly significant are the numerous initiatives promoted in school for a more direct awareness of young people facing the world of work.
It is a duty to pay attention to the phenomenon, not to dwell in the alarm of its social gravity, to apply and improve the legislative rules.
On the other hand, the President of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini stressed - as the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each one of us and imposes on all institutions a firm commitment to put an urgent end to you -
‘The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not take away that the number of white deaths is nevertheless impressive’ noted the president of Anmil Pietro Merandelli.
\"We would not, in fact, like to see this \"lower trend\" translated into less attention, because it is precisely when attention slows down that explodes the tragedy.
We believe that at general level there is still too little done to counter the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be exercised through multiple actions.
In our view - it has emphasized Merandelli - greater controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this from the school world -
\"There is a need for further effort - he added - in terms of communication and public awareness.
But, above all, there needs to be a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards a phenomenon that represents a social emergency.
Merandelli then denounced - the gradual deterioration of the levels of indemnification provided for by the victims of labour - and the -care policy to which the system is moving in recent years -
The aim, then, is to return the insurance guarantee to the worker - he added - because the fate of those who are fortunate should not depend on spontaneisms or expansion from time to time made available by the legislator -
Mp3 readers under accusation risk hearing
Listening to high-volume music for an extended period of time using portable musical devices such as Mp3 readers can cause permanent hearing injuries.
This is what the European Commission refers to, which in a statement issued in Brussels quotes the opinion of the newly identified Scientific Committee on Emerging Health Risks (Csseri) of the EU, published today.
\"From this scientific opinion - it is read in the note - it emerges that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable musical apparatus weekly for more than one hour a day holding the high volume apparatus risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity\"
“I am concerned that so many young people who often use portable musical devices and mobile phones at high sound levels can unconsciously damage their hearing irreparably,” says Meglena Kuneva.
\"From scientific findings - the head of the EU continues - there is a clear risk and we must react quickly.
What matters most, we need to sensitize consumers and make this information public.
We also need to review existing control systems, in the light of this scientific opinion, in order to ensure that they are fully effective and keep pace with the new technology.
Brussels asked the independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the large use of portable musical devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise from them.
‘Scientists — concludes the EU’s executive — confirm that there is cause for concern and the European Commission will now examine with the Member States and interested parties what measures could be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable musical devices and related equipment.’
At present, there is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable musical equipment to 100 dB, but concerns about hearing damage that can result from excessive exposure to such noise sources are growing.
It is possible to limit these damage by using solutions such as reduced noise levels and duration of exposure.
In its opinion, the EU Scientific Committee notes that users of portable musical equipment if they listen at high volume (more than 89 decibels) music for only 5 hours a week exceed the current limits on maximum permitted noise at the workplace.
Those who listen to music under these conditions for longer periods risk a permanent loss of hearing ability after a period of 5 years.
This would involve 5-10% of the users of these devices and their number can be quantified between 2.5 million and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Germany gives way to the Commission for the future of the capital
Today we start, in March we end, in June we will draw the sums.
This is the schedule set by the Campidogly for the work of the \"Commission for the Future of Rome Capital\" which settled this morning in its new headquarters behind the Terme di Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the 49 other members of the Commission will develop the guidelines for Rome.
Once the beatings are closed in March, the Junta and the Municipal Council will evaluate analyses and projects, so that they can present the strategic plan for Rome in June with the \"official ball\" of the Campidoglio and its mayor Gianni Alemanno.
The Commission is completely independent and all the political, social and cultural ideas - it wishes to emphasise German - will have to provide proposals for an idea of development in Rome, of which the political decision-makers, which remain the Junta and the municipal council, will then be able to make use.
There is no overlap of roles but only the will to have a place where to develop a great project for Rome.
In March he will finish his work and then he will dissolve, because this experience must have a precise time limit.
In June - announce the mayor - we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of Rome Capital -
If the Commission is accused of being useless, as its opinions will not be binding, German replies: 'Everything depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and on the quality of its proposals.
If the quality is there, as well as in France with the Attali Commission and as well as I am sure in Rome, its contribution will be essential.
Too often politics is crushed by the management of daily life and the emergences that are sometimes being manipulated.
On the contrary, we want to look longer and farther, from a deeper perspective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future -
In addition, the mayor of Rome wishes to point out that this Commission is neither an unnecessary body nor a wagon: it is absolutely free, it will not cost a euro to the Roman citizens and will serve to reason and involve the best intelligences that the capital expresses.
For German, in fact, it is necessary to have a strategic, not closed or immovable reference design, to allow our city to make a genuine leap of level, of which it has absolute need, thinking with unitary spirit to its future -
A future that, he specifies the mayor of Rome, will not be limited to the current municipal boundaries but will look far beyond the point of view of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as Capital, but also in view of the role that Rome can and must play as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean.
Obama? The first anti-American president. That's why
He wrote a well-known American politician who keeps us going independent: \"Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, with his decisions, decimated the US economy and had relations (as he does today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam -
The attacks against Obama are increasing just as the election date approaches.
She wrote a Miami lady on a website: “This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a big face: he believes he will win the highest office of a nation that has had in all two governors and five black senators.
They are actually attacks that don't say much; they are clearly racial attacks and they don't answer the voters' question: will it be a good president? Epoi there are the chickens; they all say that Obama will win and with good detachment.
In this case too, there are those who speak with the heart but not with the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper, in the belly of the southern United States, wrote an editorial: once in the cabin to vote, we know who will vote the American patriot.
He's out on one side of the American mentality, covered to the last one.
\"Say what you want, then we'll think where to put the cross, whether on Obama or on McCain\"
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we'll leave America.
Things never said before, which almost certainly appears the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all these reasonings, the winning weapon for democrats is George Bush.
They asked 1500 people: what were the mistakes made by Bush during his term of office? 89 percent answered: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam this nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and was sent home to kicks in the seat.
In Iraq there are 4500 soldiers who have lost their lives and Americans have not been forced to carry out the suitcases.
Yet Iraq for the majority was Bush's weak spot.
Those who take the place of George W will have a huge task to do.
U.S., economic shock is also felt by journalists: in newspapers it is time to cut. And many blame the internet, \"killer\" of printed paper.
Fifty hundred US journalists have been questioned by the PEW Research Center on the state of their profession and mental control regarding the future.
Well, today journalists are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, newsmen have not openly stated that they feel less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like once.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is an economic model crisis destroyed.
In addition, the cuts made in the newsroom, in the room where editors work to put newspapers together, is a big problem.
It is a problem that must be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if we do not want traditional journalism as the general public sees it to be remixed substantially.
A clear but complex pessimism pervades the American journalist today.
Six out of ten newspapermen and executive seniors are convinced that journalism at national level is following a wrong path.
In the local field, the executive group is 65%.
Printed against broadcast.
It's not hard for journalists to see where the web is going.
The biggest publishing houses open up an internet tour, for many views such as the \"killer\" of printed paper.
The \"economic pressure\" that journalists warn has increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope that it will do something good for their journalism.
The biggest gap today in American journalism is between those who run the newsrooms - i.e. the directors - and the reporters who work for them.
56% of executives at national level are sure that their reporters share their values, while at local level the percentage falls to 23%.
For some this has to do with the \"security of work\"
Executives who think they lose their jobs over 3 years are 47% at national level.
For the staff reporters, it's going to be 30%.
The one of the \"safe work\" at the staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work with a contract.
In an immense country like the U.S., with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and internet employers often offer what they want and thus become a matter of -take it or leave it - take or leave.
The directors receive almost always large wages, while the editor can also earn 10 thousand dollars a month, in addition to pension and payment of insurance.
For holidays, then, reasoning becomes complicated: every day after the first year, after the third to reach 15 total days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, for their admission, are \"familiar\" often during the year.
It's all about climate.
UNIPOL: TRIBUNAL ROME, DANILO COPPOLA RESTA A GROTTAFERITA
The president of the second criminal section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the instance of the immobilirist Danilo Coppola who had asked to be able to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a home in the city of Rome.
Coppola is investigated for bankruptcy in the context of the counter-scaling investigation of Unipol-Bnl.
In the course of his trial last week, he obtained the discharge from the residents transformed into a residence obligation in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the realtor could travel from the town of the province to a home in the capital.
According to the court, however, these movements (which it has held against the PM) would allow it to influence its company and access the evidence that accuses it.
Elites in danger
The phenomenon had already manifested a few days ago with the vote of the House of Representatives against the 700 billion dollar rescue plan launched by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and is, more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
It gives us a confirmation yesterday's New York Times informing us that the ongoing crisis is breaking the Republican Party, increasingly divided between its old East Coast soul, moderate, favorable to the federal institutions and business community, and its new soul, instead, conservative, hostile to \"the Washingtons\" and the world of finance, strong especially in the Central and South states.
The soul, for the point of fact, which became preposterously alive with the vote I was saying at the beginning.
But this just mentioned is just one example of the changes, of the major changes, that the current economic earthquake may or may already show: not only in the United States but throughout the West and perhaps not just here.
Both in the USA and in Europe the crisis seems to function as an accelerator for long-term incubation phenomena that in the new climate solidify and finally come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-updating, the extraordinary revival, of the dual state-sovereignty category in relation to a sort of renationalisation of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking-financial institutions which, yes, have strong ties with abroad, but which, first of all, are very much involved in the budgets of people and families living in a single country, in a single state.
This creates immediately a political problem for those who govern it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and families who, among other things, are also an electorate.
I mean, the crisis seems economically global, but politically it is almost exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems essentially out of play or not to have much to say: the flashing test is given by the European Union which divides as usual between the different interests and between the different state strategies cannot decide any common political line.
And so it is by the government of every single state that all expect interventions, rescue and relaunch plans, new rules, and above all money provision: since when you get to the narrow are only the states that have the economic resources, the mass of financial resources able to try to put things back in sixth.
They also have the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of immeasurable value, in certain circumstances, of which no market and no international organisation is likely to be able to have such a value.
This new emphasis that the crisis puts on the national-state element is, of course, in perfect harmony with the increasing importance that the most recent developments in the economy tend to attribute to a very closely related factor to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we were now meant to be in the realm of the network, of increasingly sophisticated technology, of immaterial, while we were convinced that globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we realized that our future will have to make the accounts increasingly with those very little immaterial things that are water, crops, oil.
All things that, look a little, can be transported from one place to the other of the earth but are nevertheless absolutely linked to a limited space, to a territory.
Because those who find themselves sovereign, certainly have several more cards than those who are not, to those who are fortunate to live in a place without crops, without oil and without water.
I come to the second innovation, however, which presupposes a fracture.
Those who say Territory, State, Government, inevitably say Politics, and so Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective needs authoritative leadership, the request of someone who can take the situation in hand.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leadership, economic species, revealed so inadequate and full of shadow zones.
And together, something even deeper and somewhat disturbing: a discredit, an indifference, an image of inadequacy, a sense of distance, which tends to involve the entire ruling class in an increasing number of Western countries.
In other words, it seems to be becoming more and more popular, in vast areas of the population, the conviction that before their actions are the same ideas as the social elites so far in boom, their way of feeling and being, their culture in the overall acceptance of the term, to have made their own time and to be increasingly alien to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership, in short, feeds underground a ramified but powerful movement of delegitimation of the ruling classes and traditional political structures, which manifests itself in the sudden ‘revolution’ elections or in the sudden developments of the collective moods of the last and most recent times, from the conservative rise in Austria-Baviera to the collapse of the Labour consensus in Britain, to the rebellion of the American congressmen against Bush (and perhaps also the victory of the right in Italy has something to do).
It is the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rituals, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their formats would say someone, make them more and more difficult to understand, and therefore to represent, what is not now taking shape in the deep layers of Western societies and that the economic crisis revigorates, increases, potentially stirs to dismigration.
In the face of all this to speak of a 'rebelion of the masses' on the agenda would be frankly exaggerated.
But keeping your eyes open is certainly not at all.
The Supercoil for Walking on the Walls
Defeat the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in the future walk on the walls as Spiderman.
It is the goal of several American research centres and now a team of four institutions has gone very close to us.
With a adhesive of only 2.5 square centimeters, the scholars managed to hold a body of 100 kilograms on a vertical wall.
STUDIO - The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of scholars is an evolution of existing ones using a particular structure of carbon, called carbon nanotubes.
\"The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged as a pile of spaghetti,\" says Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology of Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the legs of the gechi, covered by microscopic hairs that manage to ensure perfect adherence to the animal.
Tests conducted on various materials, such as glass, Teflon and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these rettiles and at the same time - it is easily detached from the wall» explains Liming Dai, researcher at the Engineering Faculty of the University of Dayton.
- \"This material could be useful as a transient adhesive\" adds Liming Dai.
Maybe to walk on the walls just like Spiderman? Maybe so, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use such as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electric current.
Other applications may concern aerospace engineering.
So far, no superheroes.
THE OTHER RESEARCH - The University of Berkeley, California, is also looking for a new adhesive.
In an article on the magazine of the American Chemical Society, Californian scholars presented a microfibre-shaped adhesive such as hair that self-cleans from dusts during movement on a surface to always maintain a perfect grip.
Pharmacies: never with fruit juices
Beware of grapefruit juice, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, which are consumed mainly in summer because they are disintant and rich in vitamins, if they are taken together with some life-saving drugs, alter their absorption by amplifying or decreasing their effectiveness, depending on the case, with even serious health consequences.
To reiterate the risks of both packed and fresh fruit juices associated with the taking of certain medicines David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, and from the 236th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society currently underway in Philadelphia, launches a new alert: a glass of grapefruit, orange and apple juice is enough to reduce the absorption of some life-saving drugs, cancelling its beneficial effects and endangering the health of patients.
The grapefruit juice was already finished under accusation because it was considered responsible for increasing the effects of certain anti-arrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, anti-staminic and neurological medicinal products to levels considered toxic.
FARMACI A RISKIO - The same Italian drug agency had reported it in a newsletter two years ago alerting doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger of this mix and to be careful about what they drink if they take drugs such as Diazepam or Metadone.
NOT ONLY POMPELMO - According to experts also orange juice and apple juice contain substances that inhibit drugs.
Along the list of active substances inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
Hence the call by Michele Carruba, director of the Department of Pharmacology of the State University of Milan: \"These findings are usually reported to the various agencies of the international and national medicine that may eventually change the information notes of the drugs.
So always read the package leaflets of the medicines you take and if there is something that is not clear, do not impress us but ask your doctor or pharmacist for clarification» stressed the expert to the agency Ansa.
The Nobel Prize in Economics in Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize for the Economy was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his studies on trade models and on the localization of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a neokeynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known editorialist of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of Bush administration's foreign economic and political choices.
A few months after the attacks of September 2001, on the days when Enron failed, Krugman had foreseen in an editorial published in the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States.
A prediction that did not give rise to a few controversy and that for years it was addressed to the economist, but that now proved to be correct.
\"I am surprised and also a little shocked at the speed with which the memory of scandals such as Enron's collapse or Worldcom disappeared from the public's attention,\" Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smagi, of the European Central Bank's Executive Committee, Krugman is a \"great-value economist\", but also a disclaimer with a very aggressive style, particularly critical against the excesses of freeism of the Bush administration\".
Open Office, here is the third edition of the package -anti-Microsoft»
It is the day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open-source suite of personal productivity that aims to reach more and more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, as a free alternative to the best known Microsoft Office.
After almost a year's work by volunteer developers, to whom SUN Microsystem monitors, the new Open Office shows itself to the general public with different news: the welcome screen and the magazine interface and make it less spartan, if they add more substantial ones such as native compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest ISO standard version.
Attention also posted to interoperability with the Office 2007 suite, Open Office is able to open the documents with Microsoft's new extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific features of some modules such as that that that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example for sending them via e-mail, or the possibility to import PDF files into the graphical processing module, keeping the original aspect of the page.
Again on this front you can create documents (PDF hybrids) that accumulate the typical graphics of Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or a text computer.
Collaboration is an element that has received different improvements within applications: in the spreadsheet you can intervene in multiple hands between different users, avoiding conflicts about changes, in the text maker, each collaborator is given a color in the comments for better recognisability in the review phase.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice features on the web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they should release the final result.
The version in Italian can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and added to the English version on the mirrors from Friday.
As well as for Windows and Mac OS, as usual the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request the installation cd can also be sent to the home or at the workplace.
And if the theme of free can be a drag for the spread of houses, it is in the business environment that Open Office the suite tries the great bet, already being able to rely on several projects already made in public administration and schools.
And there are also the realities that provide an ideal training, advice and assistance service for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could open business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for Word's corresponding videowriting; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for Powerpoint's emule presentations; Dbase, as in the case of the most famous Access is the program that allows you to work on the databases; Draw, is finally the graphic module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that to date we are nearly 3 million and 600 thousand, with the release of the new version it is likely that you can also overcome the expected amount.
Kohl is also positive is the fourth case of doping
New case of positivity at the last Tour de France: this is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, the Gerolsteiner team, third-class and winner of the best climber mesh.
Returning the news is the website of the daily L'Equipe.
The 26th Kohl is the fourth positive corridor to the Cera, the third-generation Epo, after the Italian Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, also the Gerolsteiner.
The analysis of Kohl blood samples is one of those performed in recent weeks by the laboratories of Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counteranalysis confirms the positivity in Cera, the Austrian will lose third place at the Tour and will meet the two years of canonic qualification.
To confirm the news of Kohl's positivity to the Third Generation Epo is the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who informed the Associated Press that he had notified the Austrian authorities of positivity.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed himself on the final podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, also winning the best climber's t-shirt.
IMMIGRATES:New YORK TIMES IF YOU WANTED, IS ITALIA RIZED?
Italy - from the country of emigrants has only recently become a privileged destination for immigrants - welcomed reluctantly.
Is this turning the Belpaese into a nation of racists? It is what one wonders in a long article the New York Times that dedicated a long article to the debate on racism in Italy starting from the case of young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case highlights what Nyt defines as the \"northern paradox\": the northern regions are at the same time the ones where we register - more integration and more work - but also the \"highest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the highest support for the North League\"
Confirming the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, Nyt also cited the episodes of intolerance of Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not just.
Also the new legislation wanted by the League that tightens the brakes on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of illegals is cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
Tendency emphasized by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: \"Giorgio Napolitano meeting Benedict XVI at Quirinale called for the State and the Church to work together to defeat racism\"
Student victims of car rental up to 900 euros for one room
The university rent market knows no crisis.
According to Sunia's latest investigation, the tenants' union, taking a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
\"The phenomenon has now taken on very serious characteristics to the point where it excludes the entire range of young people from the right to study for the very high total costs that the families of origin should support - explains the head of the study office of the Sunia, Laura Mariani - in these cities the strong demand by students has so deformed the market to initiate a process of generalised increase also for the residents -
In most cases rent offers contain a number of infringements: free, unregistered contracts, without limit of canon, connected sub-rents.
For the Sunia it is necessary to take extraordinary measures which, through the revision of the tax burden, can reduce prices.
Looking at the details of the survey, we see that in Milan, for a bed in Brianza area, there is a need of approximately 450 euros; for a single room there is a minimum of 650 (Black Band area) to an average value of 800 (Lambiate area, Udine and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 (in Vittoria area).
In Florence a bed seat costs on average 350/400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in areas close to the University, 250/280 euros are needed for a double bed, 370 to 500 for a single one.
In Rome in areas close to the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) approximately 600 euros are asked for a single room, 450 for a place in a double bed.
Values only slightly lower (550 euros for a single room) in areas close to other universities (Ostia and Cinecità).
It saves only if you move to peripheral areas: 300 euros for one bed and 450 a single one in Prenestine, Centocelle and similar areas.
In Naples, 300/450 euros are required for one room, from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Polyclinic, Vomero and Colli Aminesi areas.
In Bari for one bed you need 250/350 euros, at least 350 for one single.
In smaller cities prices are lower in absolute terms, but have a higher weight in the city economy.
In cities where the phenomenon of rent to extra-Community students, such as Perugia, is more frequent, there is a further anomaly: the increase of about 25/30% of the canon asked foreign students than that applied to Italians.
Good-bye old cinema Paradise, cities erase historical halls
The historical cinemas close in favor of the Multiplexes.
\"A city without cinematographic rooms is a blind town, it's like a face without eyes\"
The image offered by director Giuseppe Tornatore pictures effectively what is happening in the large Italian urban centres but also in the cities of the province.
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the birth on the outskirts of the large multisales and the consequent death for the consumption of monosales in the central areas of the cities, is one of those events that appear to us inescapable and incontrovertible but also has all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
To disappear are often historical places and loaded with memory, it is as if there was less of a friend, an acquaintance with whom we shared a piece of road and many emotions\", notes the director of New cinema Paradiso, the film that twenty years ago was worth to Tornatore the Oscar Prize and the Grand Prix of the Jury of Cannes, and who told the poetry of a province hall and nostalgia for a way to live the lost cinema perhaps forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the main association of the exercents, speak clearly: in the last five years they have closed the 316 films of traditional type, and to pay the major discount are mainly the rooms in the main cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the areas most affected by the closures is Emilia-Romagna with 82 cinema monosala lost, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And in a demonstration that the first person responsible for their disappearance is the advent of multiplex, these are the three Italian regions that have recorded the largest number of new multisala cinemas: 195 extra screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
\"The Italian exercise has developed irrationally\" observes Paolo Protti, president of Anec, - it is useful that new structures are built but it would be necessary to ensure the survival of those already existing, because when a city hall closes, not all of his visitors are willing to move into multiplex.
Not to mention, then, the lack of funding for the fund in favour of the depositors: the state's prior debt is about EUR 10 million.
It is shameful, from an ethical and moral point of view, that the government does not respect existing laws.
In order to support the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros a year would be needed\".
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, concerned about the closures, decided to run to the shores with the signing of a protocol between Comune and Anec, the first such in Italy, to protect and promote monosala cinemas both in the historical center and in the periphery.
Among the rules envisaged are tax facilitation measures in favour of managers and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: the spectators will be able to enter the restricted traffic area and will have special rates for the stop and some parking.
“It’s an initiative that I like” notes Giuseppe Tornatore and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by setting up other measures.
It is true, however, that in order to counter the overpowering of multiplex, traditional rooms must also improve the quality of sound and image, because the public today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the Supercinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to do \"New Paradise cinema\" to which I had been thinking for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass in front of the Rialto or the Quirinale of Via Nazionale now closed, where I have experienced so many shared emotions, not to see the posters nestled by the dust I turn to the other side\".
Link between politics and 'drangheta arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro
\"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to standardize the choices of the Commune to the interests of the Cosca Piromalli\"
The accusations made by the magistrates of the Antimafia Directorate of Calabria to the mayor and vice-syndicate of Gioia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and to the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competition in mafia association.
In manettes also Gioacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and the public administrations, and his nephew lawyer, homonym of the boss, already condemned by association for criminalizing mafia mould, condemned to compensate 10 million euros.
\"In contempt for any legal and moral rule, as well as common sense,\" the prosecutors wrote, the two local authorities had expressed their willingness to pay counsel to lawyer Piromalli.
\"It would have been so granted to the cosca - they write the judges - to enter the municipalities officially, facilitating the possibilities, already substantial, of control and of the address of the public administration\"
The president of the Calabrian regional junction Agazio Loiro does not hide that - collusion between local authorities and organized illness - in his region: - There are areas where mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressures of 'dragheta, heroes who keep clean'
This morning's arrests followed last July's arrests with which the police announced they had decapitated the Piromalli shell.
Since the end of last April, the town council of Gioia Tauro was dissolved but already in 1991, and always for alleged conditioning between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been raised by the task of administering the Municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the Udc at the time of the dissolution, was elected to the head of a coalition of right-wings, after the ballotage of May 2006.
He shouted at the scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He called in question the then Deputy Minister of the Interior Marco Minniti, accusing him of having architected everything for a political question, but the judges, in the order of arrest signed this morning, explain that the cosca Piromalli had even come to ask for the variation of the project of A3.
From the environmental interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, write the pm, it emerged - the willingness to marry the needs of an entrepreneur, representative of a larger group notoriously close to the Pyromalli, standardizing the choices of public administration to the interests of the cosca -
When the energy is born from the waves now go down in the field the big
It is an exterminated site, which occupies more than 70% of the planet's surface and is now being discovered by the world's major energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources on which they have put their eyes, and now they are trying to put their hands together, colossus like Chevron.
The possibility of obtaining energy from sea movements has been studied for a hundred years and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
When the price of oil fell around 1980, the idea of using marine energy was put aside, but now the environmentalist agencies and the new increase in oil give impetus to the sector.
London’s World Energy Council (WEC) estimated in 2007 that 15 percent of the world’s electricity requirements could be covered by sea-waving facilities.
This amount would be twice that currently produced by nuclear power plants.
And more would be the currents and tides.
Put to the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy was the Energys, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build a plant in northern Portugal.
When the understanding was announced, it seemed a revolutionary step.
Two years away to bet on marine energy are increasingly and among these companies have always voted for traditional energy.
\"Chevron is studying the technologies on ocean energy - he has declared the spokesperson of a company associated with the American oil colossus to the economic newspaper Wall Street Journal - and is evaluating the possibility of cooperating with us -
The cooperation in question relates to obtaining a permit from the US Energy Committee, which is necessary to start a marine energy exploitation project in Alaska.
It is a signal not just a little, especially if it is considered that in Alaska the U.S. continues to extract oil and President Bush has recently launched a plan for new trivelations.
In addition to the Chevron there are the Verdant Power Inc. of New York and the Ocean Power of New Jersey to walk the path of energy that comes from the sea and the sums invested so far, no matter what is known in the details, indicate an interest in ascent according to observers.
Technology to be developed.
Experts are talking about technology at dawn, also because marine energy does not escape all doubts about the environmental impact.
For now plants such as Portuguese plants or some in Scotland are small and do not seem to create major problems in the ecosystem.
In order to produce energy on a large scale, however, technologies with a greater environmental impact must be used.
And the choices are different: the Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of boes connected to each other.
The push of the waves, which moves the boes up and down is converted into hydraulic pressure by pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
The pressure turns a turbine that in turn feeds a generator.
Electricity is sent to shore through underwater cables.
For now there are four such installations in design, waiting only for federal approval and part of energy could serve a military installation.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces energy for a mall and parking using six submarine turbines in the East River of New York.
The movement of water when there are tides turns the turbine blades, creating a rotational movement that feeds a generator.
Verdant said she has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorisations to take advantage of the energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say to the Institute for the Research of Electricity, now deserves the potential of tides.
Although this is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is about the energy of the tides that were like that of New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others facing the coasts, have already invested 7 and a half million dollars in 2008 and expected investments up to 35 million for 2009.
