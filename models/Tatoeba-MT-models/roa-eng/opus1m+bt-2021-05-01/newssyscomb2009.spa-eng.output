The triumph of the right populist in Austria together make up 29%
Early elections to the Austrian parliament have brought about the first approximate results, a considerable weakening of both parties of the present great coalition and an expressive strengthening of the populist right party.
A strong and special loss has suffered from the Austrian People's Party (OVP), where the position of the current president, Wilhelm Molterer, is seriously shaken.
On the contrary, the leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZO), the head of the government of the state of Carinthia, Jörg Haider, prepares his triumphal return to national politics.
According to the approximate results, Social Democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest party in the country with 29.8 per cent votes, thus losing 5.5 per cent of votes compared to the last elections in 2006.
Worse still has the OVP that loses 25.6 percent, almost nine percent votes.
They are the worst results, literally catastrophic, in the history of these two great Austrian parties since the postwar era and especially for the people who called these early elections.
In early July, when the OVP came out of the coalition, the people had a considerable advantage as regards preference to the SPO.
It is clear, however, that the voters punished them for letting the government wreck.
Already in the first reactions to the results, speculations were heard about the resignation of the party president and, to this day, Vice Chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this month could be achieved at the exceptional meeting of the party presidency.
Such an evolution would obviously facilitate the path of the constant and nearest starting point of the electoral results, that is, the renewal of the great coalition between SPO and OVP.
In view of the fact that the reinforcement of both parties on the right of the populist - the Liberals (FPO) have won approximately 18 percent and the BZO, about eleven percent of the votes - and that the Social Democrats at the same time expressed their fears that the same was repeated in 1999 when the popular people negotiated with the populists (then FPO was a unit, but in 2005 it dismembered BZO) for a coalition government that managed to create a sanction on the part of the European Union.
Because of this evolution, Haider has made it clear that he is already prepared to collaborate with any party and that he is already taking his return to Vienna, to national policy.
The Green Party has also managed to reach parliament, although it has lost slightly and descended from third to fifth among the Austrian political parties.
No other party clearly exceeded the limit of four percent and therefore is not part of parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool down
If the problem of Czech scientists who have been accused in India for illegally collecting beetles cannot be solved, it could be a cooling of Czech-Indian relations, according to Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg.
Thus the minister in New York, after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart, Pranab Mukherjee.
\"If this would not be resolved then yes, then it would surely come to this cold,\" he noted after the meeting that was organized on a Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, after the meeting, that the executive can hardly get involved in legal matters.
However, he stated that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was exempt from charge and punished with a fine, the government can negotiate with the local government of Darjiling in whose jurisdiction the matter lies.
\"Your problem could be solved,\" said the minister.
For Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, the best would be, according to Mukherjee, to appeal to the highest courts.
Then he could ask for the exoneration of the case and wait for the sentence to be released, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his colleague expressed himself on the same terms during the meeting.
\"He advises to appeal to the High Court and then the pardon would be possible,\" said the Czech Head of Diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can get into the matter is by getting the convicted legal competent support, the Indian minister said.
On the other hand, he said that such support was already obtained by the Indian side.
We have the greatest interest in keeping the best relations with India, which have a long tradition.
The Indians also recognize this, said Schwarzenberg.
On the other hand, as ČTK said, his colleague insisted that the Czech Republic considers the problem of Czech entomologists of great importance.
\"We really consider it a tremendous mistake to imprison and condemn these Czech scientists,\" he announced.
The Minister circumvented the answer to the question whether he had received from the Indian side the promise that he would deal with the matter.
\"I have received quite a few promises,\" he said.
A Czech referees a fight on the seabed
I approach an electronic wall map, it represents Australia surrounded by sea.
He is not interested, however, in the continent but in a small point lost in the blue ocean.
The island also belongs to Australia, along with the seabed surrounding it.
At the same time, the region is as large as a single continent, says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the team of thirty members working in the UN Division for Ocean Law and the Sea.
His head, director of the Division, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the exhibition and sometimes completes it.
Rule this heel and enthusiasm of work.
The seabed still hides a little known world, rich in natural sources.
Oil and other mineral raw materials can be found, but also unknown organisms up to today that carry the key to the development of anti-cancer drugs.
The fund is larger than the firm land
Countries with coastlines today have begun to fight vehemently the new territories under the sea.
According to the UN Treaty, they take advantage of the rights they agreed in 1982 at Montego Bay in Jamaica.
It is essentially the so-called continental border which sometimes extends to a few hundred kilometres from the coast of the given country.
It has, according to the Treaty, exclusive rights in all the resources of the Continental Border.
The continental border means the part of the seabed and its surface, which is a natural continuation of the continent under water.
It reaches the boundary of the coast of the sea, and often, to the border of the two hundred sea miles, that is, pure economic zone, explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the given country to the Commission, for the delimitation of the outer limits of the border continent, must be delivered with scientific technical documentation based on investigations and measures.
It is the result of a series of years of preparation of work.
One of our tasks is to organize a technical and legal expert aid commission.
To date, the commission has processed five requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For now, only those of the last three countries mentioned have come forward - Mikulka adds.
Not long ago, Australia's success had a worldwide impact as it was the first one that essentially expanded its marine rule.
However, it was also achieved by New Zealand - the seabed area that the commission gave it last week is 1.6 million square kilometers, i.e. almost six times more than the size of the state itself.
Both countries invested millions of pain for their study.
The profit that will be gained from the use of the seabed will, as they promise, be invaluable.
Other states are also gradually submitting their requests.
They can do so up to 10 years from the time they ratified the Montego Bay Treaty.
Where the continental border ends, the region of the ocean fund declared by the Treaty as the common heritage of humanity begins.
Already here, no nation has an exclusive position.
The right of exploitation in these areas is administered by the Treaties established by international institutions.
\"The seabed, however, is no gold mine,\" said Director Mikulka with emphasis, adding, \"that its separate areas are legally and clearly restricted and its regime defined by contract.\"
Czechs in the Pacific
And today, part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It deals with other countries of the then East Block within the common organization - Interoceanmetal -
This was achieved in 1991 with a Treaty as investors as well as few other states, states called the pioneer investor.
It has the power to explode in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is something larger than ancient Czechoslovakia.
The bottom there is damaged, it is something as well as a marine replica of the Tatras.
A total area of 75,000 square kilometres can be exploited.
The area is rich in polymetallic concrete deposits containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese - adds Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A Macedonian employee of the Division, Rober Sandev, brings us a sample of that kind of concretion.
It reminds us of a small potato or a little fantasy, the Shem, which according to legend revived the Golem.
During the release of the hostages the command of German special forces was in the place of action
In order to solve the hostage crisis the Egyptian government had asked for German aid - the experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special forces command was ready, but the operation was not carried out.
More and more details are known about the circumstances of the release of 11 European tourists in Egypt.
According to data from the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior in the action of salvation, the German special forces also participated indirectly.
Therefore, at the place of release were the specialists of the German army as well as GSG 9 officials, the federal police aircraft squad, of the Federal Bureau of Criminal Research, also experts in the field of logistics of the technical charity.
As the spokespersons of the ministries reported on Monday night, the German forces did not need it because kidnappers, realizing a violent liberation, let their prisoners go and escaped.
The Egyptian government accepted Germany's help to use it as a support on the spot.
“Unfortunately, that time did not come,” said a spokesperson from the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
On 19 September in southern Egypt, the raiders had kidnapped a group of 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian companions.
After kidnapping the hostages in the desert region of southern Egypt, they were deported from one side in the border area between Egypt, Libya, the Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers became unknown to the end as well as the details of the release or possible rescue payments.
Meanwhile the saved and healthy people arrived in Cairo.
Steinmeier said that the hostages released were under the tutelage of the German embassy.
He did not say a word about the details of liberation.
At first in Berlin there was no information on their return to Germany.
According to the newspaper - Bild - 5 tourists and special forces have to return to Airbus from the German air forces and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
The United States House of Representatives does not approve the package of salvation
The first camera of the Congress of the United States failed with scarcely a large 700 billion-dollar package for financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell very drastically.
The United States House of Representatives rejected with 227 votes against 206 the government package for saving financial markets.
Despite all appeals from President George W. Bush and former politicians from both parties, it did not reach a majority for the program with which disorder should be limited in financial markets.
With dramatic action, desperate defenders had still tried to convince critics to accept the large $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, the leader of the democratic negotiations had asked Members to vote even if the plan was not so popular.
\"It is difficult to receive political approval to avoid something that has not yet really happened,\" he admitted.
Already during the vote the Dow Jones fell to more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The cause of that was the worries of investors that the state saving package could fail.
He rested at the end of the vote and after the failure was made public, he fell again.
The experts have other serious turbulences in international financial markets.
In order to bring the programme into force, it is necessary to have the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Organizers record the increase in number of reservations
It seems to be a good winter for German travel organizers:
According to one study, the sales volume of travel reservations for the next few months increased compared to last year - even the winter season in more than 30 percent.
According to a study, despite the weakened circumstances the desire to travel from the Germans remains as before.
As reported on Monday the travel association of Germany (DVR) in Berlin, with travel reservations for the winter season travel agencies recorded a volume of sales that is 31 percent more in comparison to the same period of last year.
According to the investigation of the GfK market research institute, reserves for the autumn months had already risen in number.
Thus the sales volume of travel agencies in October was almost eleven percent more compared to 2007, the DVR reported.
The basis of the results are GfK figures which are the information analyzed on reservations at 1200 travel agencies and computed approximately for the entire market.
The data collected are travel reservations made until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weakened course of the dollar over all trips to the United States are of great demand, the DRV reported.
In this case the number of reservations increased almost one third.
The German preferred destinations are not only Spain, Turkey and Greece but also the German regions.
Especially organized travel is highly preferred, explains Klaus Laepple, the president of the DRV.
In view of the fact that energy and food prices increase, in this case travel costs are - better calculateable for the customer than during an individual trip -
Among other things, consumers can save money with early booking discounts or with All-Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
Also in the summer months the trips were well booked, so that the volume of sales compared to last year again rose - although according to another study the number of Germans who were making a trip, comparing last year, went down.
My First Octoberfest
The hits of the parties under the open sky in the endless Balneario, the beer in jugs of a liter and the famous people dressed in traditional Bavarian costumes of designers.
A debut at a tent.
Really Susanne Kronzucker and I don't have much in common.
She is blonde, the moderator on television and wears a traditional Bavarian costume to measure.
I have dark-colored hair, I'm a student and my dress is already used.
But there's something that unites us: we're barely in the tent, the photographers have already rushed towards us and filled their memory cards with the photos - it's very flattering especially because I'm first in Oktoberfest.
That's how you make friends.
The traditional cheap Bavarian costumes seem to perform their function.
In fact as a tourist in the Oktoberfest from northern Germany my feeling of well-being with a traditional Bavarian costume until this day was still limited.
But after arriving at the Prado de Teresa everything is not for that long.
Almost everyone wears the traditional Bavarian costumes or leather pants; none seems to be given a case or feel unpleasant - everything is absolutely normal.
Only my apron gets rare looks next to a banana stand in chocolate.
A munitions call my attention to my front that I had dressed in the wrong way: - the left part is single, the half is the virgin, on the right side is engaged, behind it is a widow. -
Oh, God, now I'm abrogating from behind the left.
\"It's all right,\" he says laughing.
The others do not care about many of the subtle methods to flirt and wear caps where it is written - To drink to get dressed - and show them, without asking, their bare ass.
A young boy who behaves exhibitionistly is called Bob, is from England and is also for the first time in the Oktoberfest.
It seems to him - Gorgeous - what he pronounces with a -or - very long.
He tells me after he put his glass next to a liter of beer that he just drank.
He put it right next to the fire mouth, most of them think that's a garbage bucket.
So Bob is one of the famous people who know how to drink a lot.
The others are not very lucky and cannot consume so much alcohol.
About eight o'clock at night the health care groups run through the party place and have to worry about poor drunks.
Sanitaries appear each time in groups - all of a sudden there are four people who bring the covered steps from one tent to the other.
That works as with most visitors: Get sober, come back drunks.
You don't see who's suffering from alcohol levels and is on the road.
\"They are the ones who - they can't anymore - gave me the answer by answering my question and disappeared in turmoil.
Victim of incident identified by the police
The 63-year-old pedestrian who died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex County has been identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road, in the city of Brentwood, was involved in the accident that occurred on Shenfield Road on Friday afternoon.
The woman was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later she died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested under suspicion of negligent driving.
Since then he has been released on bail.
Turkey extends its diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey intended to be a member of the European Union, the European powers were keen to penetrate this country.
In the eastern part of the Bosphorus, perhaps just 20 steps into Asia, is one of the most interesting relics of the disastrous imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in a neo-renacentist style.
At least, this is what the guides say.
The building is set to time the end of the platforms and leads in front of two towers, one for each corner, all looking like a typical German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The building in its complex is a little decadent.
But once the box is over, there is no doubt that the size of the company that this was the most Western door was.
The station was inaugurated in August 1908 by the German consortium Anatolia-Bagdad Corporation.
Germany, a -latecomer - in the imperial game, had the ambition of mastering the Middle East through this railway that was cured up to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond in what is now Saudi Arabia.
However, the ambitions of this imperial Germany failed during World War I.
Their railroads were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and its irregular Arabs.
Due to the relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, fell below
British rule and when the forces advanced in Egypt, pushed the Turks and their German ally out of Palestine and Syria.
The news was bad for Hyderpasha station as well.
In 1917 a munitions train exploded, destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources commented that it was sabotage.
Since then the station has fallen and remained on the edge of history.
But today, this railway, the gateway to Anatolia and all the eastern centers, serves - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's willingness to expand its diplomatic horizons.
The Justice and Development Party that is in the government - the AKP - has planned a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
There is now a new policy of collaboration.
The Turkish Government maintains excellent relations with Israel and Syria, with both the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To evaluate the parameters of this new foreign policy, I went to a letter and went to the Turkish capital Ankara, in order to visit one of the AKP leaders, an expert in foreign policy, Turkish Prime Minister Suat Kinilioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a jolt trip, which produced the cadences of the ancient world in the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital - a new city, designed to rule a new secular state, far from the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, with its clear Islamic roots, represents a paradigmatic change in Turkish consensus
which has sparked some suspicions in the West and especially in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the headquarters of the AKP, an ultra-modern structure of stone and steel - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by medium-built shopping centers and - power bakeries - where middle-class managers in business costumes - men and women - meet early in the morning to agree/do business.
Suat Kinikioglu could be a middle-right politician of almost any party in Europe.
I brought it, tie, I'm sure he still has a Blackberry.
The aim of the party's foreign policy is to return to Turkey in its immediate vicinity.
The Cold War was an anomaly, - it tells me.
Turkey has been cut off in relations with its interior.
Today you have to look at the East and the West at the same time.
This is not a case if it is not to one or the other.
You have to do both.
\"But surely at some point, \"I ask you, \"Could Turkey be forced to choose?\"
\"Turkey,\" he answers, \"he doesn't want to face that choice.\"
He then underlines a point that almost everyone I have spoken to so far had recited to me almost from memory: the relations that Turkey has not only with the Middle East, but with the Caucasus region, and with all the Black Sea, represent a benefit for Europe and the United States as for Turkey itself.
The message seems to be: with Turkey on board, Europe in its complex can metaphorically mount those railway lines that open the world to East Asia and the Middle East.
Again at Hydarpasha station, after a second night without sleep, my thought returns to the two German lords, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who had attended the construction of this building 100 years ago.
How surprised would they have been to know that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East, largely, would be in Turkey's hands today?
And waiting for the terminal the ferry that will take me back through the Bosphorus, I remember that in those days Turkey was considered - the sick man of Europe -
Then, there is not much doubt on which continent this fascinating country will be to claim.
Ways to Remember: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: which musical director of Guildford since 1962, Vernon-Tod-Handley (which was 11 September) was responsible for Guildford's Philharmonic Orchestra and the Choir.
As part of the musical project for the city, the following year he founded his magnificent choir of young people, Proteus.
It's supposed to be for the under 21s, but at the time the Proteus sang his finals in 1979, several of us were running out of 20s - we just refused to give it to the choir.
The name “Proteus” (the changing mythological being of the forms) represented the will of the choir and the ability to perform any music presented to it, whether madrigal or Messiaen, regardless of whether it was accompanied or with a complete orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by this choir of young people was often surprising, always exciting, and all was due to the inspiration of that man and the enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant over the years.
Tod frequently told us to - let music speak for itself -
He would say, \"The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there, in the music.
That's the only way to sing.
Its wand was always absolutely clear and precise, although never imposed, nor too flowery.
Whatever the musical splinter, it always ended up at an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any driver should have been a knight, this is Vernon Handley.
I met him very well during the two decades when he led the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Especially in the last 40 years, I have reviewed more than 100 of their concerts and can honestly say that I have never, by no one, been disappointed - otherwise, I have often been inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of size and extreme personal modesty.
He hated drivers who, in his words, simply - sold one or two well-known warhorses around the world -
We'll miss you so much.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
in his sequel to William Woodruff (September 25th) you claim that, in 1946, he resumed his studies of economic history in Oxford and in 1950 he won a research scholarship from Houblon-Norman... at the same time he was studying for a degree degree, one of master's degree and one of doctorate.
This is learned in a note by the author of Woodruff in Beyond Nab End, but is not entirely correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor of economic history at Nottingham University, a season during which he completed a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J.D. Chambers, and later published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
He spent the years between 1950 and 51 in the United States, enjoying a scholarship from Houblon-Norman, and the summer of 1952 at the universities in Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he definitely left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason Woodruff chose to overlook this part of his career is unknown.
J. Vicente Resino at Faculty of Philology
I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino-Flamenco and life, because his photographs in black and white, documentary style, are fantastic.
They called me attention to their simplicity and the force they convey, always treating the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feeling.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments -
Second assault on Honda's supersales
In November Honda will start marketing the second generation of Jazz.
If its predecessor already had a wide habitability, this new monovolumen has an even wider interior space.
All this adds up to refined mechanics, which increase driving comfort and save more fuel.
Evolution in the face of revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Jazz presents a line very similar to the model that happens, the changes made in this monovolumen are numerous.
Among other things, it is worth noting an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
However, before analyzing the new model, it should be noted that this new Jazz arrives six years after introducing the first generation into the market.
Therefore, one first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter time than the one employed by other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, Jazz is less known, in other markets this model is a phenomenon of sales.
This is the case of Japan, the country where Jazz has been the most marketed car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
Precisely in Japan, about one million Jazz units have been sold since its launch.
The second market has been the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
However, Honda wants this new Jazz to allow for increased sales within the segment.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese firm marketed a total of 83,000 Jazz units, in 2009 the estimates point to 100,000 cars, which would result in 17% growth in the European market.
With regard to the Spanish market, Honda has marketed a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda's total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation, the leaders of the Spanish branch expect to sell 2,000 Jazz units in a full year.
Precisely the arrival of the new Jazz will greatly enable Honda to pay the drop in sales in Spain.
In fact, those responsible for the brand expect to complete the year with a total of 22,000 units marketed, representing 4,000 fewer than in 2007, a 16 per cent drop.
Despite this increase in Honda sales has increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, compared to 1.6% of last year.
In addition, the Japanese firm expects to achieve 2 per cent in 2010.
To achieve this Honda quota trusts the arrival of another new model.
It is Insight, a five-door hybrid and compact size - 4.37 meters in length - of which the Japanese company expects to market about 200,000 units a year worldwide.
By markets and according to estimates by the Japanese manufacturer, 50 per cent of Insight's sales will occur in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be distributed between the Old Continent and Japan.
The Insight's commercial launch is scheduled for the first months of the year, after its presentation in society in the month of January in Valencia.
Regarding the first generation, the new Jazz grows in all its quotas.
Its length reaches up to 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), the width up to 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the distance between the axles up to 2.50 meters, which means an increase of five centimeters.
The height, on the other hand, does not vary and is kept at 1.52 meters.
Along with increasing dimensions, inner habitability also grows.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the inclusion of a new platform and, on the other hand, to the introduction of the central fuel tank, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz.
Also, the capacity of the trunk - which has a double-bottom system - rises to 399 liters, 19 liters more capacity of the first generation trunk.
It should be noted that these measures are from the engine 1.4 version, since the capacity of Honda Jazz 1.2's trunk is 379 liters.
Other improvements - as well as external elements such as rear leds or the possibility of mounting the panoramic crystal - is an improvement in access to the rear squares.
And it is that the doors that give access to the second row present an opening angle of 80 degrees, opposite the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
There are also new engines in this second generation of Jazz.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model will have two 1.2 and 1.4 litre gasoline thrusters.
Both mechanics incorporate i-VTEC technology that achieves lower consumption, emits less carbon dioxide, achieves excellent mechanical refinement and at the same time achieves a high torque throughout the engine regime.
The first 1.2 litre mechanics get a power of 90 horses to 6,000 revolutions with a maximum of 114 Nm. to 4,900 laps.
This thruster - which previously reached 78 horses - has a cost of 5.3 liters and a emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
As for the former propellant, which in the previous generation achieved 83 horses, it now becomes 100.
This Jazz 1.4 of 100 horses achieves a combined consumption of 5.4 liters and 128 grams of CO2.
The bevel shell that prevents collisions
To advance the development of Nissan accident prevention technologies, this time, in nature, in particular, bees has been inspired.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, based on the flight of bees, prevents accidents.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C which is the first step in collision prevention technologies.
The engineers of Nissan Motor Co.'s Advanced Technical Center have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Centre for Advanced Science and Technology Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of Public Relations for Trade Mark Management Technology and Research and Development, BR23C is presented as an extension of the Security Shield in four areas of Nissan.
This robot intends to strengthen the ability to prevent collisions of the brand's vehicles.
During their flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space that looks very much like the Nissan Security Shield.
But most important are the eyes made up of the bee, able to see at an angle of more than 300 degrees in all directions, allowing it to fly without interruption within its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers designed what they called a laser locator (Laser Range Finder).
This detects the obstacles that are up to two meters away within a 180-degree radius in front of the BR23C, calculates the distance to that object and sends a signal to an onboard microprocessor which, immediately, translates into collision prevention.
-When an obstacle is detected, the small robot will mimic the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by turning its wheels at the right angle or higher to avoid collision.
The biggest difference to any existing system is that the escape maneuver is totally instinctive.
If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid the obstacles, - explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Laboratory of Mobility and main engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be diverted up or down, or diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to turn its wheels and not in infinite directions and ways like bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, to prevent collisions by the small robot.
This device only needs to process information every few seconds, and to act according to that data.
It does not require keeping information or intuitive logic of previous maneuvers, so it can work continuously with only a couple of dozen KB of memory.
This may surprise us, but we're not talking about memory gigas, not even megas.
This is the first step in developing new instant collision prevention technologies, a technology that Nissan vaticin will introduce into the serial cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than the variety of lithium ions.
Another possible future application of this technology could be the integration of the unit with a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to his destination by avoiding obstacles on the way.
Tiemble before mortgaged
It should be acknowledged that the US Treasury Department, in addition to having a lot of fluid to make injections, is not ingenious.
In the face of the crisis, and to prevent Americans from embarking on garbage mortgages on questionable solvency banks, they have created a hand-in-hand game for the browser: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
That is, the Hotel de los mal credits... or the links.
The technical aspect of this accommodation and especially of your receptionist is to think about one, two and up to three times if it is time to ask for a credit.
And, above all, where to do it, which is probably your goal.
It is true that it has useful, but little detailed information.
It is more a page for teenagers than a place for all audiences.
What if the game is completed?
Well, there's a dream room in the hotel.
Something is something, because if we buy a better house, we don't talk...
Morgan Stanley sells participation to Japanese MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry into his capital of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first Japanese bank, which will pay nine billion dollars to acquire 21% of its capital, a news that has been accepted with a strong drop in its stock exchange listing.
A week after finding an interim agreement, both banks explained that MUFG was going to buy 9,9 % of Morgan Stanley's ordinary shares at the price per unit of $25.25, or an amount of $3 billion.
The agreed price is less than 19 % of the book value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG will invest $6 billion extra with the purchase of convertible securities which will ensure a 10 % return and a $31.25 conversion price.
Morgan Stanley specified that the overall operation would be based on a price per unit of measurement of 29 dollars, or 28 % above its current change.
The Morgan Stanley action lost 6,79 % to 23,07 dollars each at 17:00 GMT.
This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to bank holding status, explained Juan Mack, the general director of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which would have to allow him to diversify his activities but he makes it pass under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
Their alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street's biggest names to adopt a far more prudent behavior than before.
The modalities presented last Monday also show that the agreement has been modified over the last few days: last Monday, Morgan announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to Japanese for almost $8.5 billion.
A week ago, he explained in Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, the executive director of MUFG, - we thought that participation would be composed only of ordinary actions.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we have wanted to minimize the risks and cover ourselves. —
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley securities 7 % below its accounting value.
And the operation will result in a dilution of about 20 % of the benefit per action.
The agreement provides that MUFG may convert within one year half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares if they are sold more than 50 % above the conversion price, or 47 more or less, over a given period.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capitals contributed by MUFG will allow it to take investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
However, a spokesperson for the group refused to give details on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley should show a Tier One solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan needed to have greatly relieved his balance sheet since late August.
The last few weeks were exhausting for the group, who saw their stock exchange quote fall by half while the security cost against a risk of losses on their debt took off.
This cost dropped last Monday but remained at a high level, around 12 %.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the other one - surviving - from Wall Street's major investment banks after the breakup of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced that he raised $15 billion, partly for Berkshire Hathaway, the Warren Buffett group.
Rafael Correa in Quito, this Monday.
Refound the republic around the socialism of the 21st century.
This is the common project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, for example his colleagues and friends, is the third to put to the vote a project for a new Constitution.
Mission accomplished as 64% of the electors voted - yes - to the referendum, according to the official results referring to 80% of the votes.
According to these results, the -no - obtained 28%, 7% of the votes were void and 0.7% were blank votes.
For the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to obtain half of the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two polls at the exit of the electoral centres and a count by a non-governmental organization had announced a broad victory to the \"yes\" estimated between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed the victory of his draft Constitution on Sunday night on Monday.
The Constitution triumphed in a crushing way; it had assured, congratulating Ecuadorians in charge of the Guayaquil government, 280 kilometres south-west of Quito.
In this way, Rafael Correa has been congratulated on Chávez and Morales but also on his Chilean colleague Michaela Bachelet.
The elections, which will be held in full calm, according to the observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), referred to a text of 444 points that consolidated the - new socialism - defended by the President.
The draft Constitution implies an increase in the power of the State over the economy, reserving it the \" development planning \" of a country which lives essentially through the extraction of oil by foreign companies and thanks to foreign currency sending its emigrants.
The project, taken by Correa, elected in 2006, also grants strengthened powers to the head of State, who can do up to two consecutive four-year terms each and will have the possibility of dissolving the Assembly.
Correa already announced that it would use this power and would seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution further consolidates the principle of the free health and education services that the President began to establish in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, in which 50% of the population live under the poverty line.
Finally, it provided for the ban on the presence of foreign troops, which would put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American anti-drug operations.
The 19 kidnapped persons have been released in Chad
An Egyptian command launched the assault on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions kidnapped ten days ago in the desert arrived in the Egyptian capital after being released on Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they had been released by the Egyptian special forces in Chad.
All of them looked good upon their arrival at 15h30 on board a special aircraft at the Al Maza military base, adjacent to Cairo International Airport.
Some helicopters immediately transported them to the Maadi hospital, a residential suburb of Cairo, to undergo medical tests, so they were unable to speak to the press.
\"They are well-healthy,\" said Egyptian Minister of Tourism Zoeir Garana at the airport, \"and no rescue was paid.\"
On 19 September, these hostages fell under the control of 35 unknown kidnappers while enjoying a safari in all lands in a desert area at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, and since then they have moved from one zulu to another.
The group consisted of eleven Italian tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the Aegyptous travel agency, in charge of the organization of the safari.
An Egyptian security officer indicated that 30 members of the special forces, carried on board two helicopters, had launched the assault during the night before dawn.
A gun exchange took place, and half of the kidnappers were killed, the others fled, said this person in charge who kept the anonymous.
According to him, 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the unit - lightning - were sent to Sudan, where they had the support of German and Italian commands.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini mentioned in Belgrade the role played by the secret agents and members of the Italian special forces.
\"We must recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to professionalism and the effectiveness of our men in the secret services, of the special forces,\" he said without going into detail.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
On the eve, the Sudanese army claimed to have intercepted an underground patrol on board of which the kidnappers were found, of whom six were killed, including the Chadian chief and two were arrested.
He also stated that they were related to a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudan-Unit Liberation Movement (SLA-U), a statement immediately rejected by this group.
Letters - Silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture makes headlines and occupies the current electoral campaign.
It's better this way.
But a sector of our cultural life is always forgotten.
Who will rise up to denounce the miserable amounts granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical sites starving?
Which politician will dare remind the federal government to neglect its monuments and heritage buildings?
Why do we not have real laws that effectively preserve our heritage as in Canada and Quebec?
Did you know that the French government devotes three and a half million euros to restoring only Chinon's castle in the Loire Valley?
In the United States, it is written in its Constitution that the protection of heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected and all government departments, and all of this, in concert.
In Quebec, at least 40,000 Benevolent people regrouped in 211 societies of history, heritage, archives and genealogy are concerned with looking into history, preserving small amounts of private archives and preserving archaeological remains with little money.
These are often the guardian dogs of our heritage, who protest with energy and despair when promoters and leaders throw their bulldozers against our old stones and our forgotten cemeteries.
When, a monument to history and heritage?
The Governments of the Netherlands nationalise a part of the Fortis Bank.
The Netherlands - being the first in Europe - will help with a nationalisation of the Belgian-Holand Bank Fortis which is in trouble due to the impact of the mortgage crisis on the North American market: the three countries will fully support this financial and insurance institution, which also has business in Hungary.
This weekend, the governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands held higher-level consultations with the President of the European Central Bank and the head of the European Commission's economic competence.
Fortis Bank is the first to suffer from the Eurozone crisis in the context of the international financial crisis that has occurred in several waves over a year ago, so the decisions taken with regard to the Bank can in a sense be regarded as precedent.
According to the decision taken on Sunday morning, the three States will purchase approximately half (49 percent) of the property owned by the Bank in their area.
The Bank will safely sell part of its business, including, above all, the activities - mainly insurance - bought last year by the Dutch ABN Amró.
Fortis' actions began a sharp decline last week and for the second half of the week there were already significant signs of crisis at the institution.
However, analysts agree to point out that with their 85,000 employees this Bank is too big to allow it to break.
The company's actions only on Friday decreased by 12 percent, this being the lowest point in the last 14 years.
Since January the value of the shares has decreased by more than two thirds.
Looking at current stock prices, the total value of the group's capital on the market is around EUR 14 billion, but according to the company's executives this is not real.
The Bank's management imposed the sudden fall of Fortis' actions on the U.S. market's insecurity in relation to the approval of the US $700 billion package plan.
On Monday the actions already showed a slight increase.
On Friday they appointed Filip Dierckx as the new director general of the bank.
The Bank has also sought private investors, but so far no one has given a specific offer.
The Belgian government had already made sure that investors did not have to worry, they will not lose their money.
Among the Bank’s clients so far no panic has occurred, they did not invade the bank offices to withdraw their money.
Fortis has its own branch in Hungary and has also purchased leasing companies.
Zorro in the henhouse
In the United States, life insurance and health insurance companies, when they see the data from the purchase of a drug, often refuse to sign an insurance contract.
Privacy policy specialists fear that the personal data market will become uncontrollable.
There are personal data protection programmes, which use the prescription data in all cases unites the data subject's approval.
The same must be in independent hands, because if not, - we trust the fox's chickener - - cites the Washington Post to Richard Dick, designer of the medical prescription follow-up program.
Insurance companies depend on the price of insurance and the amount of compensation for the customer's health status and if they believe that the risk is excessive, they simply do not make the contract.
Before they sent the customer to medical control and signed with him the contract already knowing the result of the control.
Dick invented a much cheaper procedure ten years ago: with the customer's identification number he easily gets from the pharmacies the list of medicines purchased in the last year and a half and the program itself draws the conclusion on the health and disease of the client.
For example, if you systematically take large doses of pills to reduce cholesterol, it indicates that the level of fat in your blood is virtually incurably high, so you are immediately included in a higher risk category.
There are numerous versions of the programme, some of them even set a number of risks, so the insurance company besides the administration has little to do, although there are small difficulties in this regard.
Among the disadvantages of the program is for example that some medicines are multi-use, for example certain substances are used to treat both headache and heat waves and even antidepressants.
The latter is an important risk increase factor for insurance companies while the first ones do not.
Special companies were set up to consult and process this data, which, before purchasing the necessary information from pharmacies, ask for the patient's approval.
The authorities are already forcing them to do this, although they have not received a fine for the neglect of so far.
Some companies have recently also developed the results of laboratory tests and linking them with the drug consumption data get more accurate information about the patient's health status.
More and more companies have access to this data and simultaneously it is increasingly difficult to control its use.
There is an exclusive law for the protection of personal health data, but it applies only to insurance companies and healthcare providers.
The bill granting authority for the control of specialized companies for the provision of personal data is already before Congress.
Dick Richard recognizes that this is insufficient: he has therefore developed his programme, which will require the specific approval of the person for the provision of his own personal data.
It is another matter that such a person cannot deny his approval, because if not the insurance companies will not sign the contract with him.
So the hens, however, are exposed to the good will of the fox.
Marseilles Global Menu
The European Union doubles its trade with India
Since the European Union and India are mutually trade partners, this issue, in addition to the other global problems, dominated the agenda of the ninth summit.
A Franco-Indian Summit will also be held today, to deal mainly with cooperation in nuclear energy.
While the European Union recognizes that India is a great democratic power in development that should have more voice and vote in international affairs, the member countries have not yet been able to reach a common denominator on whether they should support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
This issue has not been addressed at the ninth summit started yesterday in Marseilles.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, President of the EU, José Manuel Barroso President of the Commission and Javier Solana Senior Representative of Foreign Policy, received Manmohan Singh, Prime Minister of India with whom they reached an agreement to double in five years, i.e. to increase to more than 100 billion euros, their trade.
Given that the trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this is not an overly ambitious objective.
Thus, the twenty-six bilateral civil aviation conventions with India have been legally harmonized, so air transport can also fly in the future.
India wants to sign the free trade treaty with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up negotiations.
The aim is balance, because while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi is only in the ninth place among the Union's trading partners.
The summit paid attention to global issues.
Both parties condemned the Afghan and Pakistani situation and terrorism - all forms of it - and pressed for the convening of a UN conference.
The conclusion of the Doha round of trade liberalization was also pressed, although both parties had great responsibility for their failure.
The EU has confirmed that it will cling to its energy and climate programme, i.e. by 2020 it wants to reduce pollutant emissions by at least 20 per cent.
India also agrees with this, just as the next year's climate conference should reach a global agreement and decrease by 2050 by 50 per cent the production of greenhouse gases.
They also wished to hinder the increase in food prices and supported the convening of an international conference to review the financial crisis.
Today the head of government of India will travel to the French capital, where - at a bilateral meeting - an agreement will be signed on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Paris trusts that French companies will be charged with a value of EUR 20 billion to build nuclear reactors.
According to news agency information, the agreement would be for a period of 15 years.
In Frankfurt more than three hundred Italian editors
Strong presence of Italian editors to the international exhibition of the Frankfurt book.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will be present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The international exhibition of the Frankfurt book awaits for this edition more than 7 thousand exhibitors from 102 different countries that will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the sample with more than 403 thousand titles in exhibition and with Turkey as guest of honor.
He will be the undersecretary of the Ministry of Cultural Property and Activities Francisco Maria Giro to represent the Italian government at the opening ceremony of the Italian pavilion: Italy will be institutionally and effectively present with a point Italy - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
A meeting will be held with the stamp at the Room Struktur in the 5.0 pavilion of the Buchmesse: this will be the occasion to present numbers, trends and prospective on the state of the editorials in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of foreign authors' books progressively decreases over the total Italian production, in particular for adults and adolescents.
Found Steve Fosset's plane missing a year ago
The remains of Steve Fossett's plane have been found, the millionaire disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada Desert.
The debris has been found on a height of 3000 metres in altitude, in the Nevada area of Mammoth Lakes, on the California-Nevada border.
Inside the plane, there were no human remains.
The Commissioner of Madeira County, John Anderson, has dispelled the doubts that still remained: \"The plane has been located, we have sent a squad, and now we have the confirmation that it is the same thing that Steve Fossett was flying on the day of his disappearance,\" he said at a regular conference.
The Commissioner has specified that no human remains have been found either on the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old millionaire was killed in February.
The U.S. Transportation Security Office (Ntsb) has reported that some hours after the sighting of the remains, a team of researchers has been sent to identify the apparatus: it is the Bellanca 8kcab, which has been scattered since 3 September 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, always in California, not far from Nevada, some personal remains of Fossett have been found by a couple near their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents bearing the name of Fossett, the two issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, cash and a brat.
Fossett's search had been interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The millionaire had won a place in history thanks to a long series of primitives.
In 2002, the sixth attempt had become the first man to complete the world tour in an aerostatic globe: two lonely weeks of flight.
Three years later he had made the world turn by plane and without ladders.
Among his record, also that for flying at 15,445 meters high, over the Andes, but with a copilot.
Glk, the publicity you don't expect
A Suv outside the schemes with an original and well-established design with defined lines and certain angles.
This, in summary, Glk the last born among the all-terrain-compassed trucks of the star house with which Mercedes-Benz has sought to give a window of novelty in this sector.
It will be unexpected and unconventional for the content that will accompany the launch of the Glk Suv, available in the Mercedes-Benz exhibition rooms since October 17.
The advertising campaign that accompanied the debut of the new car had launched an unprecedented communication mode through a 3D advertising campaign, first used in Italy by a motor brand.
A project with maxi-posters, articulated in three different phases, that would dominate the central street of Milanese shopping, avenue Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will start with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic version and thanks to special glasses distributed on the avenue How it will be possible to see the new suv in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, looking at the images will have the impression that the car goes out of the poster.
Next, through the use of the innovative Elumina8 technology the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its details, to recompose in a single image.
Mercedes is certainly trying to introduce something new into the stereotype of automotive communication with this advertising.
Can you with this formula capture the interest of future buyers? we will see.
It's clear who the Italian hooligans are.
In the Triveneto, the ban on access to sporting events is being adopted.
But who are those 150-200 girls and boys of which Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the group -Other Italy - that has been following for years the Italian National and that so far, to tell the truth, had never created too many problems.
And they had never met the rival's fanatics either.
The extraction of the group is right.
The promoters come from the Trivenet.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
These from Sofia have been added a small group (times, actually) of the Campaign and of Apulia.
They have three-color flags where the city of origin of the militants appears: Saturday night they have been pulled out so that they are not identified.
They inspire English fanatics.
In Bulgaria they have found a group of true Nazi fanatics, the Levski.
Figc had made available to Italian fans 144 tickets for the match: all of them already with names, so easily controlable.
And the minister of the interior had already controlled them all: among those who had gone out for Sofia there was none with a Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) at that time, none who had forbidden him to attend a stadium.
Four Italian fans, who had a history of crime in stadiums, have rejected the ticket and also the trip.
Now the Ministry of the Interior hopes to read the acts that come from the Bulgarian police to take action: in this case, it is possible to give Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) for at least five years to the fanatics who have been arrested or who has been identified in the riots.
An international Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) that prevents not only the Italian stadiums but also the stadiums of all Europe.
Our hooligans, they won't set foot in a stadium anymore.
Luckily!
But now there is the fear of imitation: let those few fifty be added.
\"We must immediately put out this fire and not legitimize anyone who behaves in this way,\" they claim from the Ministry of the Interior.
That's why -- well opened eyes -- especially in view of the national party on Wednesday in Lecce --
In Apulia there is also a small core of Ultras Italia supporters.
Tomorrow the Observatory meets, on Tuesday the Cams which can also have a section of the Aise (information agency and external security, i.e. the secret service, which takes care of the problems in the stadiums.
\"The choirs of Duce-Duce and the arm raised during the anthem of Mameli? In Bulgaria it is not a crime ...\"
This is Domenico Mazzelli's (expressed in an unhappy way) thought, for a few weeks ago, the director of the Observatory of the Ministry of the Interior (he has taken the position that previously was Francesco Tagliente and after Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had been head of Trieste public security where there is a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to celebrate the Duke but, yes, the behavior of those 150-200 fanatics who have been ashamed.
\"I don't do so\" adds the Observatory's No.1 \"reacts are assigned in the countries in which the event occurs.
So far this group has behaved well now we will see what has happened and we will take it into account for the future.
But let us also talk about the silbides to the anthem of Mameli: also those are not a crime, but if they allow they are not of education.
