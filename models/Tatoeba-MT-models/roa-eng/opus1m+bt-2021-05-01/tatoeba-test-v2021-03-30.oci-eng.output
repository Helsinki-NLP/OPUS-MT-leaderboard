Any blanket that's flat for you.
There's the wrong tones.
That I sang intad was.
Any monster that's expensive.
You can't agree with his perp.
What do you say?
The water is life.
The Tom is as big as his even.
That's what it's like to be painted.
Do you want to dance?
Turn your left hand.
That's my panties.
They're at all the sisters?
One, two, three, four, five, sheis, seven, eight, ship, ten.
The Tom that's talented.
Do you love your mother?
What did Bell make of?
Where did they go from?
That must have been cut.
And you believed what he said?
