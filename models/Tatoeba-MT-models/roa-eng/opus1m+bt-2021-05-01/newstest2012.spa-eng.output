Parliament did not support an amendment to free Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian Parliament has today rejected the proposal to repeal the amendment to the section of the Penal Code, which condemns the opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.
The amendment would open the door to the exclusion of the minister, but the parliamentarians rejected the proposal to reduce the penalties for economic crimes in the second reading.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison by the alleged signing of an agreement with the disadvantaged Russia for Ukraine on the purchase of natural gas.
The sentence is not firm yet, the court of appeal has an obligation to review it in December.
Tymoshenko was convinced that it was a political revenge of the regime, and even in the West there have been doubts about the fairness of the court.
The proposal to withdraw paragraph 365 of the Criminal Code, which condemned the former prime minister, was supported by 147 deputies in the vote.
For its approval, 226 votes were required.
Libya’s Victory
The history of Libyan liberation, or of Libyan rebellion, already has its losers.
Muammar el-Gaddafi was buried in a secret place in the desert and without him there is no war anymore.
It's left to define who the winner is.
As is already customary in the region, Islamists won the elections, but now it's about dilucidating if it's moderate or radical
The Transitional National Council has brought into force the traditional law, sharia, which we already know in a certain way.
Libya will become a country without crime, because thieves will be cut off their hands.
Women can already forget to emancipate and apostates waiting for their execution and so on.
Instead of the dictator's person, society, made up of warrior tribes, will unite for the Koran.
In Libya an order will be established that we cannot even imagine and that we certainly cannot.
However, our way of life is neither the only one nor objectively the best, and it probably did not fit, in contrast, the Libyans already mentioned.
The truth is that it is not surprising that Islamic fighters would accept grateful help from unfaithful dogs.
The only justification was that, from his point of view, NATO's attacks did not lead them to a U.S. general, but great is Allah, whose greatness they celebrated after each successful intervention.
When winners are sought in Libya, the West is not among them.
We are trapped in a shooting by Islamists and our politicians to get rid of a dictator in the person of a political ally without guarantees of profit.
Following the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not occupy Libya militarily.
In this case, locals do not have a problem expelling the \"crusted\"
But, without occupation will the oil tankers be made with Libyan black gold only in good words?
It is quite possible that it does not, but it may be that the West can finally presume to protect human rights.
Whenever the shariah followers don't cross us.
A new era of crisis begins
France and the rest of Europe go hunting for investors
A statistical peat has spread across Europe
Individual States have published their GDP data for Q3.
The Czech economy in the interim period has stagnated, while France and Germany have grown.
However, the bond market today has broken records.
Investors are no longer fixed only in Italy, but also in Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the Eurozone, Germany, Czech Republic and other European countries have already published their preliminary estimates on economic growth in the third quarter.
GDP in Germany increased by 0.5%, France by 0.4%
Both countries have made the data of the second quarter public, in Germany it has improved more than expected (increase of 0.3 per cent instead of forecast 0.1 per cent), although in France a slight reduction of 0.1 per cent (the original data were about stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter of this year.
However, in the interquatrimestral period, the gross domestic product (GDP) has stagnated and according to the ČSÚ, the trend towards gradual slowdown in economic development growth is in line.
The results are even worse than the analysts' predictions.
Main events:
In the meantime, the Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter of this year, but four-monthly it has stagnated.
In the third quarter, the German economy, according to previous and seasonally recalculated data, grew by 0.5%.
The economy of the Eurozone and also of the European Union, between July and September and compared to the previous quarter, grew by 0.2%, which matches the expectations of analysts.
The Greek economy has fallen on an annual basis 5.2 per cent.
The interest of their ten-year bonds is 28.45%.
The interest of Italian and Spanish bonds has grown to critical limits.
The problematic situation also began to affect Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc.
The interests of the Czech bond to ten years remain at 4 per cent, although the situation is worsening in the area.
In Germany, voices are raised that say that the ECB should ultimately grant loans.
Czechs are classified for Eurocopa.
They won 1:0 and celebrate the ranking with a premium of 200 million.
The football team fulfills the most difficult task of the whole season!
In Montenegro, thanks to the excellent Čech and the brilliant porter Petr Jiráček, the victory was given by 1:0.
The Czech team, together with a good dose of luck in the second time, has successfully defended the attacks of the local team, so that it will not fail to quote the European championship.
IHNED.cz followed in detail the development of the party in a thorough report.
There was almost excitement in the first half and a good dose of luck in the second.
The Czech team, thanks to the downfall of the local team towards the end, and also the excellent game of Čech and the heroic Jiráček, won by 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates its pass to the European Championship.
Because of the very correct Czech defense, the Montenegrins did not press until the second half.
The two injured of the party were Damjanovič and Vučinič, who let go of two great occasions.
In addition, thanks to the great Petr Čech, the eleven Czechs will not miss the appointment of the Cup of Europe, so the national football arcades will get a gratification of approximately 200 million crowns.
Already since the first few minutes there was a good offensive game.
Both teams were only engaged in keeping the lines and played nothing else around the center of the camp.
There was no pressure from local players in the first half, patoons to the other field in defense, just what the Czech defence could avoid.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country's nuclear program.
They formed a human shield.
Several hundred university students formed human shields around nuclear facilities in Iran.
With their gesture, they would like to express their support for the nuclear programme of their country in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
The students prayed on Tuesday at noon before the facilities and then ran death slogans to the US and Israel.
Several hundred university students formed on Tuesday in the Iranian city of Isfahan human shields around the nuclear technology center where uranium is being worked.
They intend to show that they are willing to defend their country's nuclear programme with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in a recent report, found that Iran, according to all indications, is working hard to achieve nuclear weapons.
Israel is talking about a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
The students prayed at noon before the Isfahan nuclear facilities and then launched death slogans against the U.S. and Israel.
In the event of an attack, whose aim would be to halt the Iranian nuclear programme, it would be achieved, according to Israeli sources, not only the Isfahan plant, but also the Natanz facilities, where uranium is enriched.
A daily menu of an obese child: do not breakfast and dinner stuffed
Over one third of children aged between 9 and 13 years have overweight problems, where overweight affects 9 per cent of the school population and obesity at 5 per cent.
Obese children originate in most families with an unhealthy lifestyle, according to current research.
It is once again demonstrated the importance of the environment where one grows for a healthy development of the person, as well as the models that serve as a reference.
At the table, obese children are fed, for example, by sausages at least twice as often as children of families with normal weight.
For dinner, more than 19% of obese people had eaten fries the day before the analysis, which is linked to the prevention program - Obesity is not a chance -
In overweight families there is no practice of sports, which applies to most current families, where only 15 per cent of children responded that their parents, at least once a week, find time for physical exercise.
Survey of 900 children
The survey was conducted at the end of the last school year and participated in the same almost 900 children of Basic Education from all over Czechia.
It was already the second edition of the “The Obesity of Not a Chance” program that supports the General Health Insurance Company and the Unilever company.
To date, more than 12 thousand children have participated in the project from 4th to 8th grade.
A proper diet and sufficient family exercise are determining factors, which significantly reduce the number of overweight and even obese children.
“Only half of the children surveyed have responded that they have five meals per day according to the diet: breakfast, lunch, food, snack and dinner, which is one of the basic conditions for a healthy diet,” she says.
No breakfast but with sandwich for dinner
The experts warn that, in healthy development, the details are also important, which they also count, such as having a fixed time for family breakfast.
In Czechia, however, only 23 per cent of school families have breakfast at the same time.
In most families, each one ate alone.
But the worst thing was to find out that 10 percent of households don't have breakfasts.
Breakfast is, however, the basis of a correct daily diet.
The study shows that in obese children's families, fried insanities are consumed much more frequently.
Almost all - regardless of weight - drink sweet refreshments daily (70%).
Generally sports more than 40 per cent of the children surveyed, however, among their parents this result is reduced to less than half, only 15 per cent.
Build your diet
The next phase of the study made it possible for the selected males (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to create their own diets from all possible offers according to their tastes and opinions.
The food preferences of Czech children aged between 12 and 15 years from the point of view of a healthy diet are far from ideal.
Among your favorite foods are pasta, meat and sweets
“It’s particularly alarming the popularity of sweet refreshments” is advised in the final report of the study.
As the main meal, the paste is taken by the palm and the poultry meat is closely followed.
Practically, children always reject legume and taste for fish and vegetables is very low.
Switching to healthy habits
At the same time, the study shows that children are willing to change their eating habits if they receive the right information.
In the control group of the participants in the study, who completed the questionnaire after the end of the prevention programme, obesity is not a coincidence, in many cases a major change in favor of the principles of a healthy diet, is indicated in the results of the study.
It calls attention, for example, to the sweet refreshments, where many children would begin to prefer normal and ordinary water.
Children would also choose the meat of poultry and fish for the main meal more frequently in the questionnaire and restrict the consumption of sweet food and flour derivatives.
The designer must also be a good psychologist, they support professionals
In the introductory article, How designers learn, I already complained a little that the initial lessons were already quite loaded.
I had no idea how that would go.
Conferences of three professionals in the field, how to dress up problematic characters and, in addition, a seminar on how it works in the world of the show.
And it'll be worse.
The closer the final exams, the more information and practical tasks await us
And although the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, there is no longer a pin anymore.
We have now studied with the director, Alena, (in the course there is no man) about how to dress the woman who does not have a perfect symmetry.
And so is the great majority.
Someone's short cut, someone's got a stylized figure without the right curves and someone's overweight.
The designer must know how to optically smooth wide shoulders, lengthen a neck or recreate the needed curves
We've been given some tricks on how to highlight the body of women of the kind of Jennifer López, huge but narrow waist and hips and at the same time not dress it in a too challenging way.
If, for example, the difference between the waist and hips is so much that the skirt or trousers do not fit, it is worth sewing at least one piece of extra fabric to measure.
No doubt they will not regret it, because the clothes they feel perfectly are unfavourable.
With a tailor-made skirt you will feel much better than with one that does not stop moving, getting up, dancing in the waist, etc.
The stylized body can be allowed to wear clothes with folds, ornaments, embroidered or drapes.
There are certainly many kinds of diverse information and bodies, so I'm glad I have all this information on my mind all week.
And even so, I'm afraid with the task assigned, I already have more than enough.
Each participant in the course has been assigned two celebrities, to whom he will have to design two clothes: one for the day and one for the night.
The current aspect, the fashion style that fits the person in question, must be taken into account.
She has touched me, perhaps, Miranda Kerr, you know her from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
On the inside, for me it is much better than, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who will have recently fattened a hundred pounds (please take into account the exaggeration), or the very young Selena Gomez.
The dresses we have to cut them from magazines or search the internet and print them, then elaborate them graphically.
The moodboard, which is as the full result is called, also expresses our personal style and our relationship to graphic design.
It is also important to think about the graphic part of stylism.
The designer, therefore, did not see only physically, but also took care, for example, of the product pages in the magazines (of specific topics, such as trends, pockets, coats, etc.).
The designer and designer Mario Kameník told us all about this.
But all this is left for Sunday.
The designer must have a global vision.
The three guest specialists encouraged the Saturday conference with information about all kinds of bodies.
The designer Honza Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the designer should know how to take advantage of this.
And a good designer knows how to work with one garment in different ways.
Variability is, in this case, fundamental.
Thus, such a gabardine (or as they say in English, tranch-coat) can be worn to the classic with cowboys and t-shirts, but it also serves to dress the naked body with heel shoes and photograph it as if it were actually a dress.
Or just pull it up and up the neck to get a totally different picture.
\"Play with it,\" he insisted.
What I value most is the following advice: \"In order to start working, you need to first know all the rules\"
\"Then you can break them already,\" Jakub said.
At last it is clear why we memorize all these formulas, what is combined with what, why, if it then turns out that in fashion magazines we find different results.
That's not about the parades.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know that a designer has to have more types of clothes on the reservation he intends to photograph.
Thus, for a fashionable story that has ten pages (so ten outfits), you must have prepared, ready to use, at least fifteen.
And besides that the photos the clothes work in combination with other garments, all different from those used in reality.
All this must be taken into account when designing the outfit.
Honza Pokorný assured us that the image and style they alone, in many cases, assume half of the success.
Just look at Madonna, who is not exactly an extraordinary singer, but the image and the marquetin have made her a world star.
In Czechia, for the time being, there is not yet a clear tendency to use the services of designers.
Even the famous characters also find it useless (my skills are enough, my physical aspect is not so important).
And when someone asks us for our services, you have to keep in mind that they are very likely to indicate to us a very different size than their real (less).
Then it's only left to gugle and find out if the heart magazines have already written on the subject, if a certain celebrity has grown/adhesed, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario insisted that the designer is not enough to orient himself in fashion, but he has to understand from outfit.
During your work, you should especially communicate with the people you saw, so it is essential to be a good psychologist.
He can value people, he doesn't miss, he defends his opinions.
“When a director hires you to classify the dresser and complete it with beautiful clothes, you can’t take and throw away everything that was there and say: “What a horror.”
\"Find at least a couple of things that you can weigh and recommend so that someone can put them on,\" says Mario.
He also showed us that everything should fit in the call - placovka - that is, the work bag.
It is fixed around the waist and you have all the necessary tools there.
They are objects like scissors, such as scissors, stripelusas, or unforgettables. There are also nylon yarn (which serves the stylist during the photo session of products such as bags or caps), special hook clamps for front garments, if it is larger (the pins and other types of hooks are not allowed, as they could damage the fabric), or a sewing game.
In order not to stay in passive listening and put something into practice, we have learned to coat the sole of the shoes.
Even during the photo sessions in the studio, on a flat surface, the ground could be damaged and even more exterior.
And we did nothing but coat and coat.
We couldn't touch the shoes with scissors so we wouldn't hurt them by accident.
So it had to be very skilled.
Mario has given me a joy to praise my work without reservation.
The truth is, I don't really like those skills.
This is just a small part of all we've heard throughout the weekend, in the second part of the course.
I've already realized that my professional style is not a rose path, but it gives me exactly the same as people say.
In Need for Speed: The Run competes all over America.
Review
A journey, in principle unoccupied, is complicated because of a series of improper neglects of a routine trip during the morning shift.
To some extent, expectations were met, but this was of no use, if, in fact, nothing extraordinary was meant to be done.
The new delivery, to which the title is added The Run, aroused high expectations already before its debut.
He promised that he would give new airs to the old Need for Speed racing saga and, as a result of the show, appears as a game that should not end up being a sort of action again without more.
We also feel curious about how the scenes would stay inserted, where the main character descends from the car and walks on his own foot.
As often happens in the NFS series, the results do not vary much about what we expected.
There are careers that can be given for acceptable, but in total purchase points are lost due to absurd failures, which have already appeared in the series for years.
In fact, they cannot even be called errors, but rather it is the incomprehensible deception of programmers.
The adventure starts very well.
You are introduced into a story, whose protagonist, Jack, has certain personal problems; to solve them, you are offered to participate in an illegal career throughout America.
You sit on the wheel on the west coast in San Francisco, and your mission is to get the first to New York.
The idea is to offer something interesting.
The route is divided into ten stages and then into more than fifty races.
It follows that each race takes place on a different route and the stages are located in different environments, which are quite diverse and interesting.
Thus, one doesn't even feel remotely that the game always offers the same thing.
Some of the environments are even pleasant in sight, although the technical level of the graph is equivalent to that of previous deliveries of the series.
Therefore, it is nothing of the other world.
But the desert walk, the autumn landscape or the high snow-covered mountains produce a very pleasant visual effect.
In addition, races are diversified from time to time by an atypical element.
So, for example, in the desert you find a sandstorm that decreases visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains you must be careful not to bury an avalanche.
According to that, each of the races is very well developed.
There are only a couple of models, but that's enough.
For a moment, you try to advance to a number of required rivals (normal in a classic race), then try to earn time (classical timed duel) and then await a duel against one opponent.
In the midst of all this the police sometimes appear, which only makes things even more difficult.
The novelty is the landscapes outside the car.
Interactive animations are presented when Jack, in most cases, has to escape from someone and you have to help him, always pressing the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are a lot less landscapes in the game than we could expect (in particular there are only three).
But the final result is positive, because this element does not become annoying and, in the context already mentioned, is one of the elements that make the game more interesting.
The driving model follows the traces of previous episodes.
That means today is no longer a big deal, but it can't be said to be bad.
If you're looking for a realistic simulation, you can look elsewhere.
But a career designed with a lot of action is quite suitable for this driving style, although we can find something better among competition games.
So far, all in order.
But problems arise after a certain amount of time.
Unlike the correct driving models, the same is no longer true with collisions.
Of games of this kind you can't expect it to recreate complex deformations and collisions, but in fact before a blow against any object, you can't predict how your car will react, with which not everything is in order.
It is typical that, by making a very tight advance or circulating the car with normal traffic, there are only slight rocks, but in other almost identical situations, your car ends up making uncontrolled piroutes.
Or it even ends up totally destroyed.
Thanks to the reset system, there are no big problems, but it can put you in a bad mood.
The resets are programmed so that when you suffer an accident or get out of the track, the game returns you to the last rescue point on the track.
However, in each career there are only five resets available.
If you consume them all, you have to restart the race from the beginning.
So it's only help in case something isn't going well, but it's not much to be trusted.
Sometimes, neither the reset helps, it only helps to learn the given stage of memory.
A great disadvantage of the game is that the same facts are repeated in different places.
In some curves, for example, one has to enter in a specific way; otherwise, they are impossible to take.
Other times you meet at some place vehicles - civics - always with the same configuration, even if you are the first, fifth, or you get five minutes before or after.
This angers especially in situations, when you see that two cars that go to meet in opposite directions, your opponent runs fast, but when you arrive, you must turn around or stop.
It's the same when you arrive, because it's programmed because the \"surprise\" will always happen in front of your noses.
The opponents also have a further advantage.
Throughout the game you will reach places where, without regard to the moment, you will always get ahead of the same opponent in the same place.
In addition, this happens at the end of the game, on a long bridge, which is even more shocking.
Your opponent must arrive before you, at any price.
When it goes before you, it makes it difficult for you to see the cars coming from the front, so at first you can make the car papilla.
You can understand the idea of creating a game with maximum doses of suspension and adrenaline, but the execution is so apparent that you will likely be disappointed immediately.
And it's a shame, because even though the travel model is simple, the game is fun and action, so it's often not possible to follow the detail what happens or where.
And it really doesn't matter, if the merit takes the idea with fifty exclusive clues or the ranking in the race so that it doesn't break boredom, or anything else.
An unusual idea is the change of cars during racing.
You have to be careful with the gas outlets next to the road, because right there you have to change cars, although in the vast majority of cases you will have enough of what you have.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports are suitable for urban areas, strong American cars for straight highways and exotic superports for technical driving, for example, by mountain roads with curves.
In addition, the main narrative thread also appears a thread of parallel challenges, i.e., there are races in specific places that you will know about the stories.
Here you will get not only medals, but also points of experience for your profile, which serves both challenges and stories.
Upon reaching the top level, the driver opens up several possibilities, starting with the car and ending up with funds for the profile.
At the same time, an online Autolog function is connected, which compares your results with those of other players and provides other community functions.
One of the most difficult elements to understand is how the last race is made in history.
With the car you get to the metro tunnel (step), where you run to the dark through the tracks (steps).
The speedometer marks you between 150 and 200 km/h (step) and, all of a sudden, the subway convoy arrives behind you and you are taken forward without more.
In writing we will probably have a discussion about this for several days, about whether during the game programming none thought even a little or if the authors really take us for a panda of fools.
The technical part of the game is nothing extraordinary, but at least the general visual effects result in most pleasant cases, sometimes even superb.
What a pity it is that at the most tense times the image quality is reduced and, sometimes, in a serious way.
This mainly affects accidents where many participants are involved, when continuous image quality is no longer valid.
The audio is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In order to be of pleasure to most of the youth group, the soundtrack belongs to the category - each of its father and mother - but it can be assumed that no one would buy the game just for their music.
The final feeling of Need for Speed: The Run is therefore quite confused.
If the game avoided absolutely silly mistakes, we would have trouble stating that The Run is the best NFS game in recent years.
It gives the feeling that the game is not over.
The fun is assured, but prepare because mistakes will hit you in the eyes with the strength of airport reflectors.

The Ambassador to the EU, Vice-Nová:
Czechs have a reputation for negativeists and Eurosceptics.
The Lisbon Treaty has significantly affected the balance between individual institutions.
\"I didn't expect a war to be waged without barracks.\"
\"It will take five, six years before the situation stabilizes a little, calms down, and new players get used to their new roles,\" said the Czech ambassador to the EU, Milena Vicenová, convinced her conference at the Faculty of Law.
How could you not take your motto seriously - clearly and openly about Europe - which he said already at the first part of his conference, when he managed to describe each EU body and its relations with such accuracy and clarity, as it would be the envy of many speakers of the U. Carolina Law School.
Mr Vicenová also put the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy:
\"The first is criticism, that if it is unwise, a gray official, able to assume any role, but I must say that he has left everyone bewildered, because he assumes his roles perfectly.\"
\"He is a man who can listen to the members of the twenty-seven states, communicate with them and who has a clear vision of where the EU should go.\"
The new position as a representative of the Foreign and Security Policy is explained from the question: “Who is this EU? To what number can I call it.” This is therefore an important step towards the unification and clarification of political union towards States such as China and India.
Nobody wants to forbid us from Olomouc cheese
Vice-Nová has also taken up the agenda, followed and followed the European Council in the near future.
The Czech presidency two years ago was a success.
The Czechs dealt with the emerging economic crisis, resolved the gas crisis and organized a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government at that time was identified as a very negative aspect, which seriously affected Czechia.
Czech representation in the EU has for the time being many commitments.
In the ambassador's words: \"A good shock\" not only the presidency, but also the financial crisis, which is now being addressed.
On the other hand, we need to approve the budget for seven years of the EU, caused by the current economic situation, much more complicated.
If the budget is simpler and more effective, which sectors will be given priority, which countries will receive greater support and which ones less? That is something that will be present on the agenda of the next meeting.
The ambassador also recalled her main slogans, with which she arrived in Europe: \"About Europe clearly.\"
\"The truth is that I don't like ugly abbreviations, outsiders or jargons that people don't understand.\"
\"How can a citizen understand that the cucumbers are not really invented in Brussels the curved or round cucumbers, bananas of various sizes or that no one will forbid the cheese of Olomouc.\"
It also aims to make more use of the EU's environment and bring more Czech citizens closer to the European institutions.
The Europe of Speed is waiting for us
According to the ambassador, Czechs have a reputation for Eurosceptics and people perceive the negatives rather than the positives.
It also regretted the low participation of Czechs in the European institutions.
The fault is a multitude of factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write messages of motivation, but also the little support of the Czechs.
In addition to the success of the Czech presidency, it highlighted the strength and collaboration of the Visegrad Group.
\"I believe that when a Pole and a Hungarian come to me and a Slovak approaches me, a Frenchman next to me tells me: \"What, you've already stayed, those of the Visegrad Group,\" and it's seen that it doesn't make him any grace\"
In the future, the EU, according to Vice-Nová, is expecting tough new budgetary policy regulations for the Member States.
It is perceived as something very real of the concept of both speeds, if it is no longer, in Europe, more than the new of the European Federation.
\"We have countries in the Eurozone and countries outside the Eurozone\"
We have the Schengen area and we also have the enhanced cooperation procedure.
\"It was said for the first time that only countries that want and do not, remain outside\"
\"These procedures will be increasingly and will strengthen Europe at both speeds,\" Vice-Nová is expected.
In this respect, he also stressed the role of Czech Republic and Herman van Rompuy in the implementation of the principle, according to which all the issues affecting the whole EU should be discussed among the Member States, not just among the members of the Eurozone.
Brand story:
The innovative IBM begins its second century of existence
If someone was looking for a term that would define IBM's strategy with great precision, the nearest would be - long-term -
For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is perceived as current and, however, it has already spent a hundred years since its foundation.
The basis of this long-term character was laid by the first head of the firm, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He already coined the motto that many problems in the world have a solution if people are willing to think.
Its motto - think - became its seal, around which the life of the giant future will be built (it was also the title of an internal magazine that IBM began publishing in 1935).
Watson was also the basis of a carefully raised company culture.
For us, IBM involves a long-term thought, a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM has survived and prospered for a hundred years for that reason, because he remained faithful to his basic principles, but without fearing the changes around.
That has enabled us, during our first century, to transform technology, business and society.
We hope to thrive even more in our second century - he said during his birthday, the current director of the company Samuel J. Palmisano.
A fancy system
Watson, already in the 1930s, was concerned about the care of his employees as Bağa entrepreneur in Czechia (the IBM employees were of the first U.S. workers who enjoyed paid, safe, elegant uniforms and a sophisticated pay system that awarded the best inventors and sellers.
The same long-term sophistication keeps it IBM in relation to the customer.
From the very beginning, the company was able to discover talents (when it was one of the first global companies to end any kind of discrimination, it could choose without problems).
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy is IBM's current plan, so Palmisano will replace it next year by a woman: Virginia Rometty.
She's been working thirty years in IBM, where she's been head of sales, marketing and strategies.
In recent years IBM has participated in the so-called virtual encounters, rain of online ideas, of which endless strategies and innovations emerge.
It is no surprise that there are ideas, since almost half a million people work in the firm.
An institution with a good reputation
The fixed position in the business provides the company with a strong internal and external image.
“From the beginning IBM maintained a concept of an institution rather than a technological enterprise,” says Harvard Business School professor economist and author of the book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
“IBM is not a technological company, but a company that tries to solve business problems for users of technology,” George Colony points out from consultant Forrester Research.
As the company itself says there is a difference between entering the business and creating a business directly.
IBM - or the - Great Green - - as it is known in the U.S. familiarly because of its logo, has become one of the largest companies in the world in the last hundred years.
It is possibly the most versatile technology company (develops both equipment and programs, infrastructure and web hosting services within a wide range of services, ranging from servers to nanotechnology).
It holds the highest number of patents for all American technology companies and five of its employees have received the Nobel Prize.
Among its inventions are the ATM, payment cards, financial permutations, bar codes and floppy disks.
IBM will bill this year 220 billion dollars. This year it has become the second technology firm by market capitalization (the first is Apple), when it first surpassed Microsoft in 1996.
Looking to the Future
Not all products and innovations have just satisfied the taste of customers and the moment (IBM did not bet for its own operating system, OS/2, online services Prodigy or IBM PCjr computers).
“If your business is based on progress, you can’t anchor emotionally in the past,” Samuel J. Palmisano acknowledged.
Therefore, IBM has no problem building its bases on other platforms (and equally, if they don't work, abandon them).
And this is the difference of competition, Microsoft, which basically keeps and always falls exclusively with Windows.
Future technology
On sales, IBM is mainly dedicated to services, of which about a fifth are programmed and another fifth of teams.
However, even in 1990 the teams represented more than half of the supplier's share.
As of 2000, IBM has sold low-performance assets for a total value of $15 billion. During the same period, it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of future technology.
Investments have continued since 2008, when the modern global financial crisis was first manifested.
IBM acts according to the premises of his first chief, Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis of 29 increased investments.
It seems that so far the company IBM has been able to cover the crisis.
The value of IBM’s shares since the beginning of 2008 has grown stratospherically to 120%, the company’s net profit has not ceased to increase.
IBM's currency is to change everything, except its value.
It can therefore be expected that when the next crisis comes, this flexible giant will endure.
History of IBM: from cheese cutter to space flights
The company IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago, being its original name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was already adopted in 1924 - it was originally a brand used at the branches of Canada and South America.
The basis for IBM's birth arises from the merger of four companies dating back to the 1880s.
It had inventions such as the famous - registry clock - that allows to control the entry and exit of employees.
The architect of the new company was the businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 also presided over his supervisory council.
Flint signed up to the head of a competition firm, Thomas J. Watson, to help with the management of the company.
The new leader eclipsed the founder of IBM ( Watson's ideas remain the firm basis on which corporate culture and identity are sustained).
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name indicates, started with the production and sale of all kinds of business appliances, from meat cutters and cheese to cash registers.
During the first four years that Watson led the company, the billing doubled to $9 million and began the big expansion of the company through the continents.
Watson was so crucial to the company that, almost 40 years after occupying the chair of the chief, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s IBM personnel and computers helped NASA guide flights to space (to Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the famous flight to the Moon).
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first generation of computers, the IBM System/360 series.
The classics, which established the standard of computers at that time, arrived at the market with the name IBM 5150 in 1981.
Twenty years later IBM sold its production of computers to the Chinese company Lenovo, which, for its part, acquired the consulting part of the company Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to offer a complete advice and services of high added value.
The strategy that IBM has paid over the last three years is the Smarter Planet concept, i.e., a smarter planet.
Its objective is to make more rational use of technology, although the areas have not yet been planned and the circumstances have not been improved, for example, with regard to the transport and administration of cities.
For the trade sector, IBM presented not long ago the \"Smart Trade\" platform that allows retailers to manage the full business cycle.
IBM has a long history in this country.
Already in 1932 he opened a branch in Czechoslovakia then, the first country that had it in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM ČR also operates the strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe is in Prague. Here too is a world-renowned research team working with voice recognition.
Rychtářová about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta, stay with that donkey, I don't want him anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) said it was over!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) had become the only protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), but also her lover, Darina kept hoping that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and return home.
However, he is no longer going to wait and has set clear rules for life in the future.
“Pepe can go home, but not like my partner anymore,” Rychtářová explained.
When Darina Rychtářová hosted Bartošové in his home during the summer, he could not even imagine how his marriage would end.
Despite the request, Iveta had not moved thirty days after Şíčany and Pepe did not abandon the singer.
He even publicly declared that he loved her.
In time, Darina resigned, apparently accepted her husband’s relationship and even retired from him forever.
Rychytář doesn't care who her wife is lying with.
If one day Rychtář was breaking up with Bartošová, his wife would not wait for him at home with her arms open.
He is the biological father of my children and, if he wants to live the rest of his life in our house, no one will let him out -
\"But here he would live not as my dear old man who was wrong, but as a man who joins me in certain bonds,\" Rychtářová said, adding that he had already disengaged his husband and insisted only on mutual respect.
Joseph so far doesn't care if his wife has closed the back door.
\"I accept my wife's decision\"
\"I'll be with Iveta and there's no change possible\"
“My wife established this as a role marriage and I respect it”
\"The company is still in force, I make home arrangements, I take care of the garden, the home, I shop\"
“Darina and I talked normally, the only thing is that we don’t share bed,” Rychtář said.
If Rychtářová found a new love, he would not object.
\"We don't sleep together and she doesn't care where she goes or if she has a boyfriend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take full responsibility - concludes Josef.
The worst vices of women: Do they also refer to you?
If you ask men to be able to cite some typical vices of women, in general each of them will name them without thinking.
Dear women, do you recognize yourselves in the following lines, where certain female vices are cited that manage to boil the blood to the males?
Go Shopping
Do you reproach your average orange that depends on shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one rag a week?
Do you like to buy it often on the shelves?
Then in your case you can say that going shopping has become a vice.
Some women realize that they should ease their passion for shopping, at least a little.
But to see, what woman could resist the temptation to walk around the clothing stores without more, look for well-adjusted clothes and then try them all on the tester (ideally in all different colors)?
Although for most women shopping is a hobby, for men it can become virtually hell.
Just remember how many times you have already told your partner that you better wait in front of the door.
Constant dissatisfaction
\"I'm not too fat.\"
\"I would need to thin for at least five pounds - \"I should start exercising\"
\"I really like you.\"
Don't these words sound familiar to you?
What do you mean?
Then she's one of those women obsessed with her appearance.
It's not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but many men are allergic to hearing your partner complain all the time about his physical appearance.
Strong sex also agrees that the more frequent complaints increase, the more annoying women become.
Order and cleaning in the first place
It's like an infinite thiovive.
Clean the windows, pass the vacuum cleaner, rub the floor, remove the dust, rub the tub and all that at least twice a week.
Do you reproach your partner for stepping on clean ground with a dirty foot, your children who have soiled a freshly cleaned sink and a shelf with glass doors that was so hard to clean?
In case you suffer from this deviation, try to be aware that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleaning should certainly not be paramount in the family.
This harmless desire for cleansing could threaten their relationships and family well-being.
Make unpleasant comments
The used socks are left with dirty clothes.
\"You want to put those used socks on tomorrow too.\"
\"The wet cloth is not left on the ground\"
If you make those comets to your partner more times a day, you know you'll be able to get him out of his quarters.
Of course. You don't mean anything bad, you just want to get everything in order.
Perhaps, if men knew this, women, for their part, would not make so many comments.
Calumnias and Chismes
Some women also go to slander, gossip, but also offenses and conspiracy against someone.
Women focus on relationships, so they like to talk together about things like who, where, who, how, and why.
At best to each one of us sometimes a small, harmless gossip escapes.
With the hand in the heart, this is typical of almost all women.
On the other hand, there are gossipy women of those who do not control themselves, who love to gossip and often do, despise everyone and are dangerous to those around them, especially in a women's work team.
Jágr and Voráček helped with their assistance in defeating Philadelphia
The hockey leader Jaromír Jágr participated on Monday in NHL's meeting with two attendances that brought victory over Philadelphia 5:3 in the Carolina court and put the Czech players back in the vanguard of the competition.
In both cases Claude Giroux took advantage of the 39-year-old star play, and took one more step and was declared a better game player.
Two attendances were awarded in the party and also Jágr's partner, Jakub Voráček.
After the meeting, Jágr said to the overseas journalists that Giroux had predicted a great night.
\"Before the match I had told you I'd make triplets\"
- I presented it.
“Sometimes they seem ambushed,” Jagr explained, after his performance gave Giroux a goal, following the first stretch of the Flyers.
A while later the second team intervention also had a Czech trail.
Voráček was made with the record at the back of the Hurricanes gate and moved it between the circles to Maxim Talbot, who scored.
A second before the first break a local player, Patrick Dwyer, was expelled, but from the beginning of the second part already dominated the Flyers.
Specifically by Giroux.
After he collaborated with Jágr he scored the third goal, after his shot collapsed by Wayne Simmonds's port office room.
\"I love playing with him\"
\"I don't mean he's the best player in the court, but he's certainly among the top three,\" Jágr put at his power station.
\"It never would have happened to me that at the end of my career I was going to play with a sportsman like him\"
\"I'm very satisfied with it.\"
\"I want to play for him\"
All these years at the NHL, my peers played for me, and that now produces results - adds Jagr.
Carolina still turned the game into a drama, with Tuom Ruutu's goal and then Dwyer's again, from penalty, to a goal away.
Matt Read did not allow any more complications, even though they ended up in number two against one.
\"Pronger had a good performance in our field\"
\"Downloaded the record, I took speed and Read went to the farthest part\"
\"I tried to get to the record and I'm happy because I got it,\" Voráček described the game's last goal as he lived.
With his victory, Philadelphia has set itself at the head of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal, Jaroslav Špaček, did not play until the end of the match against Buffalo, in the second third he retired for an injury at the top of the body.
Canadians not only lost one player with a lot of defence experience, but also a two goal difference, 2:3.
Tomáš Plekanec was unable to take advantage of one of the shots.
More than the points lost to the local coach regretted the large number of injured in the last row, and played the game with only five defenses.
\"That's bad.\"
\"We played the game with only one veteran player, the rest were new\"
\"Finally, but against that, nothing can be done, we have to deal with it,\" said Jacques Martin.
\"So much to rotate players turned against us, we couldn't resist it\"
\"We had to simplify the game even more, get the record out of our field\"
\"And so we left gaps,\" explained one of the defenses, P. K. Subban.
Porter Ondřej Pavelec contributed thirty Winnipeg interventions in the 5:2 victory over Tampa Bay.
Jets goals were scored by five players who put an end to a series of defeats that already lasted five games.
How travel prices have evolved since 1989
Until 1989 there were only five authorized state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Travel agencies at that time sold in most cases trips only to the socialist bloc, as travel to the West was very restricted.
The Czech tourists therefore went from vacation to the beaches of the GDR (German Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union, (Sochi in Crimea in the Black Sea) to Bulgaria and Romania (both in the Black Sea) and to Hungary (Balaton).
A positive exception was the period between 1962 and 1972, when it was possible to travel to Yugoslavia, however, then the Yugoslav regime leaned west and the trips of Czech tourists were then quite restricted.
A great paradox of socialism was the fact that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e., also the Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel freely and individually even by socialist countries.
If a citizen wanted to travel individually, for example to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter, if not, the individual trip was not possible.
Travel agencies also offered trips to the West at those times, but one had to put on the queue with a sleeping bag and spend the whole night, or have (well known) in the agency.
Still not everything was won.
The call - a promise of change - which was the condition for trips to the West, was not granted to the - politically unreliable agent - which thus could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency and, without guarantee of change, it was not possible to obtain the resources (the western currency) to travel to the West.
The vast majority of Czechs spent their vacation in their own country, so there were a large number of cottages and summer houses, which the Czechs acquired. This custom still persists.
The way the Czechs have been travelling has been a real revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 for us it was no longer going to spend holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria, last year the Czechs made 4.5 million vacation trips to countries around the world.
It is a great paradox, of which we are no longer aware today, the fact that the present favorite destination Croatia, until 1989 could not travel freely, because it was part of the Yugoslavia of that time.
In the early 1990s, visa waivers were imposed to travel to the neighbouring States of Western Europe, resulting in a huge wave of short-term visits, especially to Vienna or Germany.
The Czechoslovaks, for a long time, did not see them fed up on the excursions to the West, everyone wanted to see it at least for a moment.
For example, in Paris the Czech groups in the parks were sleeping in tents, since our income from that time did not allow us to pay a hotel or pension.
A typical feature of the Czechs of that time was to take the food with you (conservations, sausages, etc.) to save.
Another important moment was the introduction of the convertibility of the Czech crown, so our tourists could finally, after decades, freely buy Western currency.
Our standard of living was increasing and with it the average wages, which about 1997 led to an increase in the demand for travel.
With the increased demand for travel agencies began, from 1997 on a regular basis, to prepare travel using charter flight connections, which incredibly lowered travel prices compared to the past, thanks to the possibility of obtaining discounts for passenger volume.
At the end of the 90th century, Czechs were already travelling without a visa to almost all developed countries, except the US, which further simplified our travels.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary tourism happened in 2000, when it was organized, thanks to a huge demand, the first direct flight from Czechia to an exotic country, and went to Thailand.
Since that year, direct charter flights with Czech tourists have made countries distant and warm. This winter will already fly directly from Chequia to 12 exotic destinations.
Exotic countries currently visit about 100,000 Czechs a year.
Another interesting moment of this era, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the United States eliminated visas for Czech tourists, making our country one of the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008, the Czechs, for the first time in their history, have spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3 per cent) and for the first time in their history, have spent on trips abroad over 15,000 Czech crowns per head, including expenses on the stay site.
Called Ordinary General Assembly to elect the President, who could end up dead again.
Czech football has been without president for nearly five months and Ivan Hašek's successor as President of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR) is likely to not be known or after the convening of the next Extraordinary General Assembly which will take place this Thursday in Nymburk.
In fact, an agreement on the voting rules to be followed has not yet been reached.
Without the same, you will not be able to vote even to choose between the three candidates.
The interested to preside over Czech football are Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
Hašek resigned in June not without calling his colleagues for the purpose of finding a strong person who knew how to deal with football in the future.
However, after the completion of the Hašek era, a dispute arose between the two federations of the association unable to reach an agreement to choose a common candidate.
This was shown on 16 September when the new president was to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly met in vain at the National House (Národní dŭm), located in the Pragénese neighbourhood of Smichov, because the talks had been blocked and not only as regards the method of choice.
No consensus was reached nor as to who in the General Assembly was entitled to vote - only legal representatives or also delegates with full powers.
From that moment on, and because of this single point, there was a partial agreement, also supported by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, according to which representation by full powers is not possible.
However, disputes over the electoral code remain open.
Further light on the situation could no longer be shed on the Executive Committee, which, at its regular or extraordinary meetings, basically did not resolve anything.
The opinion on the possibility of voting has changed a couple of times already, but the neurological point remains the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the third round to avoid the dead spot?
“The dispute revolves around whether to proceed according to the statutes or to find another model,” says Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-presidents of the FAČR, who, from the direction of the association, represents professional football.
According to the proposed model in the statutes, the third round will win that candidate with the highest percentage of support in the federation to which he will submit his candidature.
The Moravian Region is willing to reach a commitment so that it can win that candidate with a greater total percentage of votes in both federations.
The Bohemian side, however, imposes the condition that the winner, according to these percentage calculations, must have a majority of at least two thirds.
“This would, however, remove the meaning from the previous two rounds and completely negate the concept of a bicameral system,” Svoboda said. “This is how Svoboda understands the objections of the resident party, according to which it would be best not to touch the order and vote according to the applicable statutes.
With that, surprisingly, Tomaš Paclík also agrees, although the electoral regulations established by the statutes of all candidates are supposed to be better suited to Pelta.
\"I would like to have the highest vote in accordance with the Statutes.\"
\"In order not to invent any nonsense about the representatives as in the last General Assembly,\" says Victoria Plzen's owner, who is for the first time a candidate and who directs his remarks primarily against Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him, Nymburk will decide on the new president and he believes that candidates in the future will cooperate constructively.
All passions will be settled with today's party of our national team at the European Championship.
“Football will be the protagonist again, and so it will cooperate more at ease,” says the representative of Jablonice, who of the three candidates has more experience in managing football, both professionally and regionally.
Rajchl is the most reluctant.
\"I hope that an agreement will be reached, but unfortunately, the situation is much more complicated.\"
\"This is not about the conflict between bohemians and residents, but there are attempts to adjust the rules to their own convenience.\"
“This may result in a new blockade of the General Assembly”
\"However, I hope common sense will be imposed,\" Rajchl said.
There's not much time left for all parties to come to an agreement.
Some negotiations had to take place in Montenegro, but who can know until the match starts if the football team is complete?
The special plane, in which they had to travel to Podgorica, among others Vice Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, has not come out this morning for technical problems in Prague, having to seek an alternative to transport part of the executive committee to the place where the classification party will take place.
Perhaps the crucial meeting, at last, could be the one that will take place at the ministerial level, which they expect will take place this Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, would very much like to incorporate the parties divided into the country's most powerful sport organization to reach an agreement.
There is much at stake: state subsidies, the credibility of football and also the next General Assembly of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Sports Federation (ČSTV) that will try to provide a new direction to the Czech sport after the financial problems of the Sazka lottery house.
Paclík will fight for the presidency, because he does not find a more suitable candidate.
If the leader of Pilsen footballers, Tomaš Paclik, before the extraordinary General Assembly, knew the name of an appropriate candidate who would satisfy all his ideas about the new President of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR), he would not present himself as a candidate for such a relevant position.
\"If there was a suitable person, I would be fighting for her and I would not be running for elections\"
“But until today we have not been able to find such a person,” Paclík said to the Czech News Agency (ČTK)
What motivates Paclík to enter the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl is exactly the possibility of blocking Pelta, the alleged election winner, who opens the way to the presidency of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR).
Paclík also points out that, if he wins, he would remain in the office of President only until 2013, when the regular general assembly would arrive.
In that position you would like to see an expert and good manager who is not too related to football events.
\"I've already talked to some people I could take into account.\"
\"To me it was crazy to hear some say that right now they don't even want to identify with Czech football\"
\"I'd like to change that vision,\" he adds.
What is supposed to be most disturbing to Paclík at this time is Pelta's relationship with the President of the Pilsen Roman Berbr Regional Football Association, a man with a controversial past known outside the world as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the votes of delegates in the general assembly.
For Paclík it is so unacceptable to see Pelta sitting on the presidential chair.
\"In case you win, you'd keep the status in place and nothing in football will change.\"
\"With Berbra's support, an ambitious businessman, football will get even less profit,\" Paclík said.
He also mentions the fact that a few years ago Pelta's name was associated with a telephone listening during the investigation of a corruption case, of which Pelta went unpunished.
\"I don't know what prestige football could bring Pelta's victory.\"
\"And with what eyes the UEFA and FIFA will look at us,\" said Paclík, who also cautiously took his earlier statement that \"the Pilsen Club would sell if Pelta became president\"
In the case of winning the Thursday elections, Paclík could raise cooperation with Pelta in the future.
It is also the other candidate, Rajchl, who has been supported by Paclík before the September General Assembly that ended in a fiasco.
\"He (Pelta) would be the first to follow.\"
\"He's very capable.\"
\"I could imagine, for example, as head of representation.\"
- but not as the manager of an association -
\"I also don't put the nostrils where I don't feel capable,\" Paclík added, which in September gave much attention to supporting the suspension of the Arbitration Commission chaired by Ludek Macel, later replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Paclík admits that he would dare to manage the association.
He used his private business management capabilities, since last summer he was also the Director of Pilsen, who, with his support, held the first division victory in May.
“I have the strength to change some things in the football field and contribute to its safe practice”
\"To reduce the influence of some pressure groups, which probably tend to influence disciplinary and appeal decisions, producing unpleasant situations,\" Paclík said without hiding his antipathies towards Sparta President Daniel Křetínský.
One of the priorities would also be to consolidate the relationship between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which it put pressure on political leaders to devote more money to the sport of lottery taxes.
\"It is one of the key issues to which the new President should devote himself.\"
“If you increase gambling taxes, as announced by the political parties, you would support your arguments, but frankly, you have to tell us where all this money is going to stop,” he says.
Moreover, Paclík now does not even take into account his partnership with the Pilsner Club, although he himself states that the President of the FAČR should be - not a supporter -
Pelta is in turn associated with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla of Prague.
- It's not ideal.
“But I don’t see any sense in the fact that my actions at the Pilsen Club hypocritically give way to someone else and then come back there after a year and a half,” Paclík said.
Pelta promised the FAČR new statutes that would end the dead end of the elections.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association one of the presidential candidates, Miroslav Pelt, promised that, if elected, he would ensure that the FAČR had new statutes that would serve definitively to resolve, in the future, the disputes with regard to the electoral regulations.
The representative of Jablonec is optimistic about the meeting this Thursday in Nymburk, and believes that the pre-election conflict could move towards a solution today with the possible victory of the football team.
Prior to the elections not held in September, Pelta promised to focus, if elected, on representation and fund raising.
He decided to participate in the last minute at the last general assembly, so this two-month postponement could be good for defending and presenting, in a broader context, his ideas on the management of football.
\"People at all levels have been taking care of football for a long time and are waiting to meet the new President this Thursday.\"
\"They feel that the time has come for someone to manage the partnership,\" thinks the man who mainly associates with the Jablonice Club, but who worked on Sparta and the Association's executive committee.
For this reason, he thinks he has enough experience to manage Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the elections is the euphoria that reigned in the time of Ivan Hašek.
\"Unfortunately, the statutes that were not as perfect as everyone thought were approved in the General Assembly of June.\"
\"If we exclude certain interpretations, we have a president since September,\" Pelta warned.
Exactly the readaptation of the most important document of the Civic Association was used as a lure to win delegates.
\"If I'm elected president, I'll take it as a personal challenge and I'm willing to answer in case this fails.\"
\"It's a matter of principles, without which we can't exist,\" says Pelta.
Moreover, in theory, he tries not to mess with his opponents.
Already in the past he had warned that he saw himself working with Henry Rajchl, whom he respected for his law training, being aware that his opponent would also be his first vice-president.
It had been a long time without attacking Thomas Paclík who, unlike Pelta, did not let puppete with his head.
\"It's been more than a year in the world of football, and it's already achieved some successes\"
\"His attacks but were shameful and many people were surprised by the electoral campaign\"
“That’s why many of them doubt their true character,” said his opponent Pelta, who continues to be faithful to the statements announced already in September.
His most powerful weapon is, according to him, his knowledge of football, from lower competitions to higher ones.
The latter should be escaped from football promotion.
\"As such, I would try to solve all the scandals that arose because of the Bohemians as a result of the corruption scandal of last year\"
“I would immediately be involved in negotiations with the public and private sector, to ensure that there is enough money for all football,” the 46-year-old candidate told ČTK two months ago.
He also promised that his appointment as a football president would not result in any personal changes to the staff.
\"You should first know each employee's tasks,\" he said referring to Strahov, where, after a long period of anarchy, there was an understandable nervousness.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that are being vacillated at the next general assembly, he believes that delegates will not travel in vain this Thursday to Nymburk.
If the only point of disagreement is how to vote in the third round, we will certainly be able to overcome it.
\"Football needs credibility, which will only be recovered if it finally has a leader - still two days before the most decisive day in its representative career, Pelta remains optimistic.
Rajchl promises, that under her leadership, the FAČR would start working with a desire.
If the current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl is elected in the fourth General Assembly as the new President of the Czech Football Association, many people would surely be resented.
Rajchl promises that in case he is elected, he will work hard.
He wants to implement a systematic change and make executive committee members responsible for each area of football individually.
It is also committed to resolving the case of the Bohemians, improving relations with UEFA and FIFA, getting more money for football and continuing the work initiated by former President Ivan Hašek.
As president, I would like to devote myself completely to football.
From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to selection, through professional football or training of young high-performance footballers
“With this I don’t mean I would do it all alone,” Rajchl said in an interview for ČTK.
\"I am a team player and I want to divide the powers of the executive committee so that each member can devote himself to a specific area\"
\"And I will assign difficult tasks so that football can, in each of those segments, move on with a lot of momentum\"
“Many people will probably not like this, because it will mean starting to work very hard and not only criticising the work of others,” he added.
Due to the atmosphere of criticism in the football movement, it is said that it has considered the possibility of not presenting itself as a candidate again.
- Everybody knows, I work 20 hours a day.
\"But I need to know that this will make sense and that there will be no people behind me who will stop me and hinder me at every step,\" explained the reasons for his indecision.
\"Many people have told me that I must not give up, because then they would be defeated too.\"
\"It's about having faith not to give up like that, no more,\" he said.
They say it also motivates him to continue the work that he has already started with Hašek.
\"During those two years, a large part of the work that I don't want to lose now is over.\"
\"There are processes that have begun and will have their effect within a couple of years and I would not like someone to stop them,\" he said, concerned that, if they chose the other candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the association could again be as it was before the Hašek era.
\"I believe in order, and it is something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is not able to maintain.
\"After him is above all those people who would take care of football so that it would be only a privilege for a few chosen\"
\"I can be reproached for a lot of things, but not the fact that I'm in favor of someone\"
\"I'm trying to be objective.\"
\"I want to make a football for everyone, because only so will everyone and not just the elected ones feel good,\" Rajchl said.
It also rejects the idea that only the President would be Bohemian.
\"Even though some people try to assert the contrary, I have in mind doing my best for Moravia\"
\"For example, it's time to think about dividing the second division into one Czech part and another dwelling, whose winners would go to the first division\"
“The current situation in which we have only three Moravian teams would not be given, which represents a problem for young Moravian players,” Rajchl said.
Although Tomaš Paclík, president of the Pilsner Club, joined the presidential election, Rajchl still believes in his ability to be elected.
“I still feel strong support from the Czech Federation, which elected me as its vice president and who knows that there are clear successes behind me,” Rajchl said, whose successes include the saving of some tens of millions of crowns of disadvantaged contracts, the negotiations on television contracts and negotiations on lottery law.
On the other hand, he recognizes his share of guilt that the federation is not united.
And while he proclaims that Pelta is - disqualified to regain confidence in Czech football - he sees the other rival, Paclík, as a strong candidate who does have something to offer to football.
\"No one can deny that he did a great job for Pilsen that year\"
\"In the event that he is elected, he will probably follow what Ivan Hašek has already started and would not significantly change the staffing of the staff in the committees.\"
\"I don't want to use that for me,\" he evaluates his rivals Rajchl.
The most beautiful pools in Europe
Jump to blue
by Julia Stanek
Pools with amazing optics, sumptuous bathrooms in Budapest: Those who visit Europe can live their blue wonder, and after a visit to the city or a walk, rest their legs tired in bubble baths.
A book shows where the best well-being is found in the water.
When Iris Meder made a research trip during the past year and a half, there was something that could not be missed in his luggage, a bather.
He was lying on his back on the water, looking at the artistic dome on the top, swimming towards the marble angelos, who waited for him on the edge of the pool and was amazed at the meticulously restored modernist indoor pool.
He liked the bathroom, took note in his notebook at the time of all the interesting details about the style and history of the building.
The architectonic historian Meder explored more than 200 pools in this way and presented them in his recent book \"Badefreuden\": the pools covered in Munich, the historical palaces of the bathroom in the Black Forest, the \"constructions of concrete\" in Taunus.
He carried out his journey through the most extraordinary baths of Centroeuropa in 13 countries: In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, he visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia respectively.
This 46-year-old German is a real enthusiast of bathing culture.
He doesn't want anything to do with sport, says Meder, only water is different.
It only bothers you that bathing fans have to conform to blue and chlorine-feeling tiles, while runners can breathe the fascinating smell of fir forests or listen to the happy trills of birds in the park.
“One day I wondered why swimming pools must always be so ugly,” says this resident of Vienna.
\"I started collecting beautiful pools.\"
The water surface doubles the architecture.
The grasshopper in the pool and the ethereal sauna oils. The wellness factor in the pools is so great because they attend all senses, according to Meder.
And if the builder tries, the indoor swimming pools can be a real gift for the view: -Instead of the ground, in the bathrooms you have a water surface -
\"On the one hand it is transparent, on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the entire building\"
It all bends optically: the high vaults, the colored tiles, the trampolines.
The book with photographs in small format (Badefreuden) provides on 190 pages very interesting data on the architecture and history of art in the historical oasis of well-being, but, mainly, it makes it feel like jumping to blue.
Meder, the pool collector discovers the prominent specimens in his research in Hungary.
Together with the magnificent medicinal baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, there are the waters with nitrates in a unique karstic cavity (cavities in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as some thermal baths, whose pools are of alkaline waters and are found in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jázberény).
Many swimming pools discovered in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: While the whole city puts eyes on the roofed pool of Zurich, you can look at Arlberb, covered in snow, from the outdoor swimming pool of a bathroom in St. Antony, and: In the Turkish bath there is a window from which you can see the practice on the ski slopes.
The design, perhaps more extraordinary, awaits customers in Längenfeld: The Ötztal water cathedral looks like an egg that has just landed in the Alps.
From three open sources comes steam in the winter, while from the bottom the mountains of Ötztal rise in the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Meder, the pool collector, did not invade the smell of chlorine in all the pools.
Many thermal baths smell sulphur, in the baths of Árpád in Békescsaba, Hungary, the gas oil pest is so strong that people believe they have reached a sanitary bath.
The smell comes from the medicinal waters that contain bicarbonate and alkali and whose legamo is glued to the skin when entering the pool, a enjoyment of well-being in a special way.
Iris Meder was also disappointed in one place in his search for beautiful places for the bathroom, when he wanted to visit discovered pools and sunbaths in the Czech bath of Luhatschowitz, he found himself with a blocked land.
The 1902 bathroom of the architect Duan Jurkovic was closed.
When Meder looked through the collapsed windows of the red, white and yellow modernist building, he saw the evil grow among the tiles.
The decline counteracted in a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Thermal Palace in Bad Wildbald.
These bathrooms have three stages of construction after themselves; not only can you discover Neo-Romanic elements of construction times in 1844, but also an Alhambra-style Arab hall, added in 1900.
Since its spectacular modernization in 1995, the Termal Palace is the favorite bathroom of the pool collector, Iris Meder, and not just because it is natural of the Black Forest.
“It has a lot of merit to merge different architectural styles into such a fantastic unit,” Meder says.
In a palace so the immersion in the thermal pool apparently has little importance.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank analyses the raw materials business
By Christian Teevs
Does the Deutsche Bank give up your agricultural raw materials business?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to check the consequences of speculation for the poor in the world.
In January, the head of the consortium wanted to show the consequences.
Hamburg,
For citizens, the matter is clear, according to a study, 84 percent of the Germans do not find it acceptable for banks to speculate on agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn.
Two-thirds of respondents claim that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions withdraw from this business because it intensifies the problems of the poorest in the world.
This is the result of a survey by the consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report submitted to Foodwatch in mid-October.
Author Harald Schumann shows that global stock exchanges raise prices, and banks bear responsibility for the global hunger problem.
The consumer defender's campaign is specifically addressed to Josef Ackermann, director of the Deutsche Bank, although the big banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, betting on raw materials was intended to protect traders from price fluctuations.
The main experts agree that players have decoupled from the offers and demands, and profit from the costs of the poorest.
Ackermann reacted to criticism differently than US competitors: He promised to review the claims and said that no business - it deserves to compromise the good reputation of Deutsche Bank -
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is reviewing the demands of the Foodwatch report.
The analysis must be completed by the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank Directive, together with the recommendation on how to handle the matter.
At the end of January, the bank's management will report on the consequences.
At the end, a reduction in the raw materials business, or even its total abandonment, could be achieved.
Ackermann is trying to fix his image.
Thilo Bode, the founder of Foodwatch, celebrated the news, but reaffirmed his criticism of the financial sector: \"The stakes at growing food prices show especially drastic how ruthless banks currently harm public welfare\"
Ackermann is the largest banker, especially in its obligations.
“The Deutsche Bank must cancel all the investments in its portfolio in which it puts money into play for food price betting,” Bode said.
\"It doesn't matter if Ackermann deals with the issue of the hungry people or the fame of the Deutsche Bank\"
Ackermann's inspection is surprising at first sight, but it is clear that the head of the consortium wants to offer a perfect picture a few months before leaving his position.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank published that the chairman of the Board of Directors will change something different from what was not planned on the Board of Directors.
With the abandonment of controversial agrarian speculation you can perfect your image.
And he needs you to barely care for any losses, so his successor will be taken care of.
Two thirds would cancel investment in raw materials
Foodwatch strives to maintain high pressure on the manager.
To date, more than 30,000 netizens have participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Forsa Institute had asked 1,001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Only 10 percent considered it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments in which food prices would be waged.
Many bank customers showed personal consequences when they found that their bank was involved in such businesses: according to the survey, two thirds would cancel all the investments from which money comes from agrarian speculation.
43 percent would dissuade such a bank to its acquaintances, 49 percent would ask, after reflection, to cancel their account and switch to another institute.
House 21 in Vienna
The pavilion moved
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with altibajos and a happy ending, the pavilion of the 1958 Austrian universal exhibition was awarded prizes, was in Vienna for a museum, was left empty and collapsed.
Now he's reopening as an exhibition house.
The modern postwar architecture passions, the clear forms, crystal halls, brave curves and new construction materials, typical of the thought about technical progress, for which, the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the universal exhibition of Brussels 1958 is an appropriate and well known example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion then obtained the Grand Prix of Architecture for its light and floating construction of steel and glass.
The construction is considered to be a contemporary milestone in architecture.
He made the architect so well-known that he also built the pavilion of Austria in the next universal exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder tower for MBW plus the adjacent building flattened in Munich, it became internationally known.
His pavilion, designed as a temporary exhibition building, rose after the universal exhibition at the Schweizer Garten next to the station in southern Vienna, was reformed in 1962 and a 20th-century museum was inaugurated.
The building was suitable but lacked the appropriate spaces and technology for a museum; without any wall to hang art, nor a good environment.
Nevertheless, it was used until contemporary art in Vienna had a new home.
The building has been empty since 2001 and decays more and more.
Currently, architect Adolf Krischanitz reformed the pavilion, now called it house 21 and will be used in the future as a contemporary art museum.
On Tuesday afternoon the Belvedere museum was inaugurated, to which the house belongs, with the first exhibition, a stroke of luck in a certain way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new director of the Austrian belvedere gallery since 2007, achieved a new beginning.
Husslein-Arco, a doctor in art history with a considerable career, among other things, artistic ice skater in his youth, later in Sotheby, the Guggenheim museum and founder of the modern art museum in Salzburg, made the reforms with the insistence of politicians and protectors of monuments, provided public funds and private sponsors and established their use.
With the exception of contemporary art, the works of sculptor Fritz Wotruba of the homonymous foundation should be exhibited, there should be a café and a bookshop and also a office building.
Strict control, low budget
Krischanitz was the best choice to do so.
Not only because he made a sensitive reform of the secession of Joseph Olbrichs in Vienna, he extended it and was awarded the competition, but because he studied with Schwanzwer at the Vienna Technical University and the pavilion was for him a - an important and huge place - in which he contemplated - almost every weekend - the exhibitions.
He knew about the project and the problem of the building, which disappeared with its transfer to Vienna in its change of use with generosity and ease.
In the current reforms there are major problems, the building was - an energy devourer - said Krischanitz.
The profile of the windows of the glass façade was changed, an insulating glass reinforced with fiberglass was installed and the glass ceiling was replaced by a special safety crystal.
Thermal bridges and steel beams were strengthened or replaced and asbestos roofs were rehabilitated.
Two basements were used for the new use, a light panel down between the house and the street provides lighting, a bridge serves to enter the almost new building, but still the Schwanzer pavilion.
The original exterior doors remain, the house is painted in ancient caoba tones and protected against oxidation.
And the movie room is exactly the way it used to be.
And all this with strict control by the monument office and a low budget.
“I often had to find material that was good, cheap and also liked the monument protection office,” says Krischanitz and warns of a rough soil in the basement.
Despite all pressures, problems and reforms, the building remains flexible and light.
The pavilion, which came from Brussels, has been difficult, recently said Krischanitz, a typical - casual appearance in the history of the city -
Such an architecture is - always in the wrong place - and that's why I wanted - to awaken the right consciousness -
In this case the house 21 is not in the wrong place, has happened a stroke of urban luck. The totally new and planned - central station neighborhood - with houses and offices, is located next to the Schweizer Garten.
And perhaps another stroke of luck happens: House 21 could receive a reinforcement of another construction of Krischanitz, since collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin temporary art hall and, as you can hear, negotiates with the city over a nearby place in the Schweizer Garten.
Deutsche Bahn plans a winter crisis package of millions
The company has devised a crisis plan, which would avoid the malfunctions of trains in winter.
The number of staff must be doubled.
Which costs millions.
Deutsche Bahn has spent more than 70 million euros this year, according to a journalistic report, in the fight against the failures and delays of trains caused by the winter.
The \"Bild\" newspaper reported, invoking a group's internal crisis plan, on the planned investments up to 2005 of a total of about EUR 300 million.
For what must be achieved a better availability of vehicles and the railway network even with an extreme time.
Among other things, it is planned to double internal and external employees to 16,000 posts to remove snow from roads and roads.
The aim is to clean snow and ice edges for operation and 90 percent of the needles needed for operation within four to five hours.
Two months ago, Rüdiger Grube, President of Deutsche Bahn, warned of train failures and delays also during this winter following a summit with the government and industry.
Last winter Deutsche Bahn suffered considerable problems in the transport of travelers, as, among other things, he lacked reservations under adverse weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for years for authorization from the Federal Railway Office.
There is also a delay in the delivery of high-speed trains.
Deutsche Bahn has been working for years to check the axles of high-speed trains often in the workshop, after a high-speed train had broken a shaft at the central station in Cologne.
Deutsche Bank pays millions fines in the U.S.
After the tumult over President Josef Ackerman, a new U.S. problem appears, the Deutsche Bank must pay a million-dollar fine there.
As if the problems were not enough for the Deutche Bank, its past in the US acquires the giant in the sector, the Frankfurt Institute pays $145 million (€106 million) in an agreement, to put an end to the disputes due to the bankruptcy of five major credit cooperatives during the financial crisis.
This is about the sale of mortgage securities.
The financial market regulator NCUA recrimes many large banks to induce credit cooperatives with false promises to buy financial products; they have minimized the risks.
These titles lost their value during the financial crisis and dragged banks to the depths.
\"We are pleased to be able to clarify the issue without the parties going to court,\" said a spokesperson at the Deutsche Bank in New York.
The bank doesn't admit any guilt with the agreement.
This also applies to Citigroup, which required a payment of $20.5 million.
Debbie Matz, President of NCUA, welcomed the deference of both financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. credit cooperatives and provides support in case of bankruptcy to protect customer investments.
NCUA is attempting to reintegrate the losses of millions of origin.
The agreements currently closed are their first type.
The regulator had also asked for accounts from other large banks and in summer proceedings against JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the case of dubious mortgage securities, these are the so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on housing credits.
When the U.S. real estate bubble exploded in 2007, it led to the loss of many financial institutions.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Although the results occurred a few years ago, it currently blows a complicated wind for U.S. banks.
Investors and the inspection have initiated countless processes to receive compensation or sanction shortcomings.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has produced the largest number of lawsuits.
It reproaches the 18 major international banks that the two US state mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have taken advantage of the mortgage business in a volume of approximately $200 billion.
The Deutsche Bank also has a demand from the FHFA, which is $14.2 billion worth of business from 2005 to 2007.
The inspection requires the Frankfurt Institute to respond to (substantial) losses without naming an exact figure.
The Deutsche Bank rejected debts as unfounded and explained that he wanted to defend himself.
Warren Buffett contributes 10 billion to IBM
The financial guru, Buffett, strongly invests in the IBM Information Technology company.
Since March it has acquired shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
So far the great American investor Warren Buffett has always declared no investment in computer companies or Information Technologies as long-term business development forecasts are negative.
But he has read IBM's commercial report and changed his opinion about investing in the sector.
He had to understand long before IBM mostly offers services and seeks computer systems for the Information Technology departments of other companies.
In the financial world, an investment by Warren Buffett is considered an honor.
Therefore, the Primitive of Information Technologies should be called \"Sir IBM\"
Buffett was currently unveiled at the CNBC economics station, which has acquired IBM shares worth $10.7 billion since March.
Their Berkshire Hathaway investment has increased with this to one of IBM's largest shareholders with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said IBM has not known anything about the engagement so far.
He praised the direction of regular benefits in the economic crisis.
\"They've done a great job,\" Buffett said on the strategy.
IBM has for some time established the services of lucrative Information Technologies as the operation of centers of calculation.
The old computer pioneer over 100 also offers software and advice as well as powerful equipment for companies.
Buffett avoided technology companies to date.
He said he only invested in companies whose business he understood.
On the contrary, Buffett took advantage of the occasion on a freight train, in a lubricant manufacturer or a mechanical engineer.
His Berkshire Hathaway owns approximately 80 subsidiaries, as well as part of a whole series of major consortia such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, formerly Münchener Rück.
Buffett, 81, took over the small Berkshire Hathaway textile company in the 1960s and, with wise investments, expanded it to become one of the most valuable companies in the world.
However, their way of life is humble.
That's why it's an idol for countless investors around the world.
His quick and infallible sense of making money has provided him with the nickname of -Omaha oracle -
After discovering Buffett's investment, IBM's stock in stock went up one percent.
\"The blue giant\" as IBM is known, has a stocking value of more than 220 billion dollars, and it appears, along with Apple and Microsoft, among the most valuable technology companies in the world.
With Microsoft, Buffett said, he doesn't want to cooperate.
Bill Gates, his founder, is a close friend.
The threat is real
After the discovery of - the Zwickau cell - the Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper speaks of a \"bloody ideology\" that relives.
The murders of eight small Greek and trick entrepreneurs between 2001 and 2006 have a background of the far right.
Turkey and the German population of Turkish origin have reacted with fear and concern about this news.
For many Germans of Turkish origin, a ghost that was believed to be dead a long time ago has returned, since the fire-like attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, no more episodes of extreme-right violence against Turks had occurred.
However, it has never been questioned that xenophobia exists in Germany.
The undiscovered ultra-right network reveals a magnitude whose dimensions were not, much less, predictable.
\"Returns to the revival of bloody ideology,\" headlines the online edition of the Turkish newspaper \"Haberturk\"
The \"Sabah\" newspaper points out, on the contrary, that one of the perpetrators of the crime was an informant of the Federal Office for the Defence of the Constitution and is concerned that the German authorities may be involved in the ultra-right-wing gang.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted sensibly, the weekend reminded the victims of racist violence with a vigil at the Brandenburg Gate.
Two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin together with the German and Turkish politicians reflected on a solemn act of the fiftieth anniversary of the Turkish-German agreement.
The coexistence was staged with joyful colors, like a happy ending story.
The information came to some Turkish media as a slap: \"The German gift for the fiftieth anniversary\" says the title of an article on the Turkish Internet platform - Haber X - referring to the background of the murder chain.
The German broadcast - Hürriyet - does not insist on drawing this mental connection.
The title of Ahmet Külahci's column begins to smell badly.
It notes that the murderers were people who paid their taxes and made an important contribution with their work to the reconstruction of Germany.
In Turkish German Internet forums, police behaviour and its subsequent success in searches are very critically discussed.
The authors are amazed that the German authorities have not looked much earlier for suspects in the outer-right circle.
Some are less rhetorical as to the dramatic means: \"From now on, immigrants are lost, but they are left with self-defense and armament.\"
\"This will be the best self-protection\"
-The internal peace of Germany strongly depends on the quality of the clarification and the adequacy of the sanction to the entire network, writes \"Selen\"
This means that, if the internal peace of Germany is in danger, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen will be clarified in ninety years.
The image of the ruins of the Solingen fire has been recorded in German and Turkish memories.
No other event has shown the Turks living here more clearly that there is a concrete threat and, to the Germans, that distrust and distance can lead to violence.
The attacks aggravating the feeling of group on the Turkish side.
Do not repeat past errors
In the Turkish press, mainly the weakness of German politics was criticized after the attacks, Helmut Kohl refuses to visit Mölln's survivors.
After Solingen's fire attack, he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish President and Klaus Kinkel, his Foreign Minister, replaced him at Cologne's funeral. Kinkel detailed in his speech what the Turks in Germany contributed with the taxes.
It is clear how a person's value is calculated according to the amount of his taxes.
The current information of the Turkish media shows again how deep it has since been the distrust of many Germans of Turkish origin in the legality of this country.
In addition to the effort of a broad explanation and a reassessment of extreme right-wing terrorism in Germany, it is necessary to speak frankly this time.
The bank of the Lake Zurich scandal
The most risky bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, if not in Switzerland.
The UBS has almost failed in the financial crisis and since then has slipped from one crisis to the next.
Now she's run by a German.
I'm sure Axel Weber hadn't thought about it.
After its spectacular start at the federal bank’s summit, in July it was known that in 2013 it would begin in a new and almost equally spectacular work: President of the administrative council of the Swiss Grand Bank UBS, an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber is publicly pleased, praises Switzerland for its beauty and the UBS for its newly acquired strength and lets down kind remarks about its future companions.
-The USB has achieved revitalization -
“I am pleased to collaborate with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel —
In September it became clear that everything would be totally different.
A USB financial operator in London avoided all the bank's security systems and took out 1.7 billion euros.
Oswald Grübel, director general of the USB, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to come.
The president of the USB administrative board has since been considered equally touched, and everyone asked: When does Axel Weber arrive?
Weber has been known to need to advise the bank since February 2012.
And it will take over the presidency of the Administrative Council in May, not early in 2013, as the bank reported on Tuesday.
This is hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, but a teacher of economics and counsellor and has certainly had a period of adaptation.
He suddenly becomes responsible for the strategy of a bank, which has just proved that he deserves the title - the biggest bank in Europe - for a long time.
On the one hand, the USB is huge, until recently it was the largest administrator of world goods, and on the other hand, for years, it has slipped from a scandal to the next.
Nothing, it seems, saves the old so proud Swiss bank.
The financial crisis began.
The USB had an excellent reputation until 2007.
The image of the discreet and solid Swiss asset manager, but also handy, combined with ambitious objectives, also wanted to be a large number in the investment banks.
On the one hand, with $1.6 trillion, the USB manages more money from trained customers than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, he advanced as an investment bank in the league of the world's big banks.
This impresses.
Hans Geiger, the former banker and subsequent bank teacher in Zurich for many years explains: \"Before my students, I have always qualified the USB as a model of a good bank\"
“From the current point of view, one wonders: How could I be wrong”
I was in a big mistake.
In 2007 it came to light that something went very wrong on the USB.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, director general, who until then was considered a great and very intelligent banker, resigned surprisingly.
A few months later, the reason was suspected.
The bank's investment fund took on losses with high-risk securities and had to amortize billions.
To load this, the USB announced a capital injection of nothing less than 13 billion francs.
For this he found investors, of course some had looked down on until recently: an Asian and opaque state fund of Singapore and an Arab state fund, so discreet, that his name had never been heard.
This was just the first hit.
In April 2008, it worsened.
The bank had to declare the loss of billions, Marcel Ospel, president of the administrative council, in 2006 at the second best paid administrative council in Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, the disaster continued, in view of its erroneous investments, the UBS found itself in the financial crisis in the face of bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the state.
The national bank bought problematic values to the UBS for many billions, the Helvetic Confederation gave six billion francs for a bond that was mandatory convertible, by which it became the bank's co-owner.
All of Switzerland was affected, it was said how dramatic this was for a small country, if it housed such large banks.
Finally, the sum of the UBS balance sheet in 2007 was more than five times higher than Switzerland's economic performance (see graph).
\"We can't rescue the UBS again,\" said Geiger, a bank expert.
The first catastrophe was the second one.
A few months later, the UBS capitulated in a fiscal conflict with America and was willing to deliver the data of the ad hoc customers, who had possibly failed taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, it approves a figure of $780 billion, reimbursement of unwarranted profits from these businesses with compensation for payment.
Thus, the UBS confessed that it had been more or less aided in tax fraud.
Simultaneously he lost something that had always been his capital in competition for rich customers: the aureola of discretion.
After the scandal, the secret of the Swiss bank is no longer the same.
This was followed by the resignation of the chairman of the Board of Directors and the chairman of the Administrative Board.
And the exodus of customer funds.
In this way, in a few months' time, the bank lost its credibility in its two central sectors: in the investment bank by misinvestment and in the administration of property by aiding tax fraud.
And just when it was a little quieter again, just when it was thought that the UBS was getting it again, this unfortunate operator's story happens, an individual operator cheated 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realized something was going wrong.
And it has, of course, not yet worked well with risk management in the investment bank.
“With the Adoboli case it is clear that risk controls have changed too little,” says Martin Janssen, a professor of economics and finance at the University of Zurich Banking Institute.
The financial director of a large German bank is also sure: “The problem of the UBS is that it does not dominate the risk controls”
So the idea of caution arose, with which the Swiss bankers had been present for a long time, to be the guardians of the world's greatest goods: no risk too great, instead, the security of money wants to break across the Alpine republic.
The security deposits of the Swiss banks were the symbol of the unbreakable reliability, such as Lindt and Sprüngli of authentic chocolate.
The center of the UBS in Zurich does not fit with the cliché of the solid Swiss private bank, it is only a little larger.
The situation is classic.
The bank has its main seat on Bahnhofstraße street of Zurich, which goes from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, framed by the snow-covered summits of the Swiss mountains.
Here the buildings are ostentatious, the rentals are one of the highest in Europe.
Here are jewellery such as Tiffany`s among Swiss traditional businesses such as the Sprüngli confiteria.
Here the Swiss banks have been living for years: from the national bank, from the palace of Credit Suisse, to the elite private banks like Julius Bär.
It enters the reception room of the UBS through a heavy turning door.
Inside the walls are covered with marble, in front there are large leather armchairs, next to the bench logo there is a large sign to indicate the \"security\"
UBS knows what the client is looking for here: Security.
The two major Swiss banks, the UBS and Credit Suisse, have at some point shifted the idea of the great Swiss bank, or betrayed it, as the president of a small Swiss private bank thinks.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all, as all Swiss bankers do, also with the business of both large banks.
The UBS has become too big, thinks, mainly in the investment bank, where the Anglo-Saxons have gained ground.
There the Swiss had nothing but to say.
\"And they have long become accustomed to the customs of Anglo-Saxons\"
In fact, UBS changed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank, gave its first big profit and then the disaster came, no European financial institution had lost as much money in the high-risk jungle as the great Swiss bank.
On 15 October 2008, the catastrophe was evident.
On Wednesday, the government coalition of the small country of seven million decided on the greatest rescue operation in the history of its nation, writes author Lukas Hässig in his book \"Der UBS-Crash - - The crash of the UBS - in Spanish).
Politicians granted up to 68 billion francs or approximately 45 billion euros to save the large bank from bankruptcy.
How does it happen to them?
It is spoken to the Swiss bankers, so see the problem in the dimension of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks merged into a powerful consortium.
There is a bank that, due to the merger, was too large for small Switzerland, and continues to grow.
Therefore, it served to complement the two different precursor banks of the UBS: a rich but sleeping bank with the center of the administration of goods in Zurich and a poorer but stronger internationalization.
Suddenly, the internationalised investment banks arrived in a timely manner with a lot of money, with which they could run a large financial bicycle.
There are two names related to this rise of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, head of the UBS consortium from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then president of the administrative council.
\"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a perfect team,\" says bank expert Hans Geiger.
\"Wuffli, the intellectual, modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive that managed to open up from learning at the bank to the summit\"
Finally, Ospel broke up with Wuffli.
And in the end Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake: \"He thought his models were a reality,\" Geiger says.
\"It's a tragic case.\"
Tragic, maybe.
It is clear: Disatin arrived before the case.
The employees of the UBS clearly remember the meetings of directors, in which Wuffli, the head of the consortium, always repeated the same motto: Down from the throne to Goldman Sachs.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
They headed the \"League Tables\" the classifications that then documented the success of the banks.
UBS wanted to be at the summit.
A few steps went well.
In foreign exchange transactions and in the stock negotiations it was at the highest.
However, the business advisors in charge highlighted a weak point: In the business of international interest, in banking language, fixed income, there is enormous compensation for large banks.
The UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
To fill these gaps, the UBS began an adventure that almost cost him his existence.
Loans of growth, invested both the same bank and one of its high-risk funds created in high-risk American investments.
It became a powerful machine to hold U.S. mortgage credits and then sell them, keeping certain risks on its own.
And also, as other banks sought the downfall for a long time.
\"In the summer of 2007, as the American real estate market was in flames, the UBS bought there,\" said Geiger, a bank expert.
So great the euphoria, so deep the fall.
One manager had to go, as the attempt to order was more complicated than they expected.
The posts in the UBS have become projectable seats and are unsafe to date.
Currently, who runs a large bank, has an almost impossible job.
You must find a strategy for a bank, before all logic business models are lost.
Geiger, a bank expert, has an idea, ending the investment bank, concentrating on the administration of property, returning to the Swiss roots.
The bank doesn't want to get that far (still).
But investment banking must be very low, it is clear at present.
On the next Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the new bank president, will present his future strategy to the world.
In fact, it was only considered in the 51-year-old Italian-suice as a transitional solution, since the bank was surprisingly separated from its predecessor Grübel.
Meanwhile, he imposed himself: He must conduct UBS business on a permanent basis, he communicated Zurich’s bank on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return the investment bank to its state in the middle of the nineties.
Deletes 3,500 posts.
But this is not enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is it?
What do you want to make money for?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is sure to ask today.
So far, he's just saying he'll first find a house with his wife in Zurich.
Next year.

Smart Grades Extensive in Cities
In many places the farms are considered to be \"problem birds\": they do not expel these very intelligent animals from the cities for a long time, experts say.
Some like them, others want to get rid of them very quickly, the farms have belonged for years to the image of the city, but in many municipalities they accumulate the complaints of the neighbors for the dirt and the noise of the animals.
Although no means have appeared against the problem birds so far.
Farms are no longer leaving cities, experts say in the first Farm Symposium in Leer, East Frisia.
There experts throughout the national territory discuss possible solutions.
Search for alternatives in cities
Ecologists attribute the problems of cities to the migration of certain protected farms; chemical applications in agriculture clearly end up with traditional vital spaces.
Hunting, growing edification and falling trees that host them make life difficult for birds.
The farms are protected.
There are large colonies with over 600 breeding pairs in Soest, Westfalia, among others, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen, as well as in Leer.
There in 2005 the negative headlines of the press were blown up by a controversial project to mass kill the grates of the district.
Critics have called the hunting of animals by means of bird traps and the killing with sticks as especially brutal.
\"Expulsing them and avoiding them normally nothing is achieved,\" said Werner Klöver, an urbanist and landscaper of Leer.
Shooting the nests with water or throwing the trees are often unwanted consequences, says Manfred Kaiser, Lahr's environmental expert, Baden-Wurtemberg.
-The animals deviate, the large colonies divide and distribute elsewhere -
Helping them out is only conceivable as an exception in hospitals, old-age residences or colleges.
\"We must live with them, we no longer catch them.\"
Without the surroundings, the problem is not solved in the cities, opin Wolfgang Kellner, Mayor of Leer.
It is possible to combine to drain animals from sensitive residential areas and baits to settle in other places again.
‘Information panels instead of chain saws — Uta Maria Jürgens, psychologist and ethnologist advertises against in order to treat animals in a totally different way:’The best thing is that we can stand a peak on the face with aplom —
Jürgens co-founded in Schleswig-Holstein the teaching circuit on the Ascheberger Farms, where signs report on the life of the intelligent birds.
Meanwhile, the project is accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also has his own opinion on the criticisms of the noise of birds: \"All are forms of communication, they have much to say\"
The intelligence and skill of these animals are legendary, the farms not only take advantage of the resources to access strange bits, if not that they make tools to use them as resources.
Recently, Ethologists at Cambridge University checked four farms as far as the intelligence of birds arrives.
In an experiment, the birds quickly learned that they should drop a stone on a platform to reach a moth larva.
Without much training, they firmly recognized the size and shape of the stone to fall on the platform.
In a second trial, the cunning greeks had to solve a complicated problem.
The researchers placed a small cube with a pulley larva in a vertical cylinder.
The birds could not reach their prey with the peak.
But the researchers left them a piece of wire.
With which the four animals formed a hook, with which they fished the cube in the tube shooter.
Three of the four farms got him in the first attempt.
Portugal in the Eurocopa 2012 thanks to Cristiano Ronaldo
Bosnians and Turks have no hope in the championship.
The favorites, Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland will also be in Eurocopa 2012.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have sealed in the play-offs the latest Eurocopa 2012 tickets in Poland and Ukraine.
Guided by the triumphant hero Cristiano Ronaldo (8., 53.), Portugal went to Bosnia-Herzegovina 6-2 (2-1) and, after the 0-0 of the party to go, made the five participations of the Eurocopa followed.
The Czechs got 1-0 (0-0) in the game back from the play-offs with the outsider Montenegro, after they made things clear in the game of going (2-0).
Croatia did not let them mark it in the 0-0 against Turkey, Ireland got a 1-1 (1-0) flop against Estonia.
Nani (24.), Helder Postiga (72., 82.) and Miguel Veloso (80.) scored the other goals of Portugal.
Former Bundesliga professional Zvjezdan Misimovic with a penalty (41.) and Captain Emir Spahic (65.) shortened distances twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic got a red card (54.).
Bosnia failed because of Portugal in the play-offs of the 2010 South African world.
At the Stadio da Luz de Lisboa, Portugal began perfectly.
Ronaldo executed a direct free from more than 30 meters to get his head on the points.
An hour later, Nani showed his skills to score from afar and got 2-0 from 25 meters.
The Bosnians, who did not shine in the first half hour, had their first clear opportunity thanks to the goaler Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburg team player, the English leader Manchester City sent a head to the pole, but the ball did not cross the carrier line (33.).
Jiracek succeeded for the Czech Republic
Next, the Wolfgang Stark College of Ergolding was in the eye of the hurricane.
After the attack on Helder Postiga in the area of Bosnian Penati, he decided to show Portuguese the yellow card for throwing himself on the ground (36.).
On the opposite side, Stark painted a controversial penalty after an action by Fabio Coentrao, who transformed Misimovic.
After the break, the European vice champion of 2004 clarified everything with four goals.
The Czechs ended the last doubt in the 81st minute with the goal of Petr Jiracek.
The 1976 European champion is ranked for the fifth consecutive time for Eurocopa.
Coach Michal Bilek's team with the Bundesliga Legionary Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1. FC Nürnberg) were also lucky and had to overcome a second reaction at the initial stage.
At the last moment, the gatekeeper Petr Cech avoided with a reflection a possible goal at the door of Tomas Sivok (9).
Montenegro had more possibilities with the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic in action.
Damjanovic scored at the 40th minute of the back of the front, very right at the Cech gate.
After the break the Czechs had to protect the world-renowned gatekeeper, the front of the FC Seoul escaped again (50.).
Finally, the goal before the end sentenced the party.
In the meantime, Turkey took advantage of Zagreb's football marvel.
Four days after 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks did not pass from a 0-0 in Zagreb.
While it was almost certain that the national coach Guus Hiddink should leave his seat on the third-party bank in the world of 2002, the Croatians celebrated their fourth participation at the end of the Eurocopa.
Before 31,000 spectators at Maksimir Stadium, the Turks almost got a dream principle.
In the minute seven and with a long-distance kick, Selcuk Inan only managed to touch the pole. The attacker Kazim Kazim could not send the ball inside the gate.
After the second reaction, Croatia took more and more control.
After the break, Croatia did not allow any goals to be set for it.
Together with Mario Mandzukic of VfL Wolfsburg, who in the minute 62. made the site of Ivan Perisic, Dortmund, Danijel Pranjic (Bayern of Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintrapt Frankfurt) are the legionaires of the Bundesliga in practice.
Trapattoni goes to Eurocopa
In Dublin, the Irish have celebrated their first participation in the Eurocopa since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward took the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who triumphed with 4-0 in the ready-to-go match for a previous decision, was put on the head in minute 32.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) tied with the guest team.
Ireland pressed from the beginning, but had to wait until minute 23. when Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had his first great chance.
From the very first moment, the defence avoided potential goals of advantage.
But in minute 32. he came forward.
After a defense of the porter Pavel Londak, Ward appeared and kicked the ball through the line, getting the 1-0.

Personal Massacre
The intense and generous new book by Peter Englund, The Beauty and the Sorrow (The Beauty and the Sorrow): An intimate story about World War I begins with a long-time dramatism of the kind that can cause one's soul to fall to the feet.
Here are some action tips: Start this page gently and make it your own.
He will come to know these people very well in Mr Englund's novel narrative, and this dramatism personae will function as his GPS, a lighthouse during those few moments when, as one of his men and women, he is confused and helpless in the fog of war.
Mr Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, who awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
What you've written here is a rare book, which correctly describes as -a work of anti-history -
It contains some notable names, important treaties or famous battles; there are virtually no ambassadors, elegant journalists or discussions about tactics or material.
It is not so much a book about what happened, it explains, as - a book about how it happened - It deals with - feelings, impressions, experiences and mood states -
The beauty and pain of the battle - combines wartime experiences of about 20 ordinary men and women, both sides of the war, from high school and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance and administrative drivers.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Some will become prisoners of war, or lose their members, become crazy or die.
Their lives blink here as votive candles lit in a church; some new ones are added to the mixture while others turn off.
Mr Englund's book is a deviation from the standard history books.
It is also a corrective to the notion that World War I was only the terrible war of trenches on the western front.
“The beauty and pain of battle” is experienced through other war theatres: the Alps, the Balkans, the eastern front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book fall on the hives; one spends Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; tse-tse flies are an unstoppable problem.
This is a moving book, almost from the beginning.
The war floods the lives of these people as a natural catastrophe, a hurricane Katrina that stinks of string.
When the artillery fire is heard in the distance, and you are a woman who is at home with your children, do you stay or run away?
Who's coming anyway?
Almost nobody understands what's going on, not even why this war has to be fought.
\"Facancy of facts\" observes Mr Englund, \"has been filled with conjectures, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors\"
“The beauty and pain of battle” follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor from the high sea fleet.
His stories have been obtained in most of his memories, letters and other material previously published.
The explanations of their lives may be frightening or moving, but they are more full of life in the accumulation of small moments, lost details, of Mr Englund.
Many of these are about deprivations and to manage with what is there.
About telling the story of a German schoolgirl says: \"Successful, all over the world.\"
\"Coffee substitute, fake aluminium, imitation rubber, paper sales, wooden buttons\"
He keeps talking about the food in Germany.
Describes -meat made from cooked rice and pressed into meat fat (and finished with a false bone made of wood); tobacco made of roots and peels of dried potatoes; shoes with wooden soles -
There are, you see, -837 substitutes allowed for meat in the production of sausages, 511 substitutes for registered coffee -
Some stories are about honor and value.
An American recognizes his own impulse towards savageism and manifests about war: “You feel that after all, this is for what men are conceived and not for sitting in chairs with a cigarette and a whisky, the afternoon newspaper or a best seller, and pretending that this barniz means civilization and that there is no barbarian behind that stale, dull fencing fence”
On the other hand, a British soldier realizes that he will probably die, and that no one will know or care about him.
\"Once one refuses to think of sacrifice, one would like to think that it could happen in front of the public,\" he writes.
On the other hand, it's awfully similar to a convicted person being strangled in secret.
Other observations are about an old Europe disappearing, and about new types of terror.
\"The conflict has become increasingly an economic competition,\" writes Mr Englund, \"a war between factories\"
It reflects the arrival of what he calls - a new species in the livestock of the young century: The eloquent mass murderer and ideologically convinced with good-made clothes that executes his butchery while sitting behind a desk -
People behave in unforeseeable ways; there is both novel and heroic behavior.
Mr Englund speaks of the soldiers who actively tried to take a venereal disease of prostitutes as a way to evade service on the front.
“The most grotesque expression of this can be seen in the trade of gonococic pus, which soldiers buy and embezzlement their genitals with the hope of ending up in the hospital,” he writes.
\"Those who are truly desperate rub it on their eyes, which often gives rise to a life-blindness\"
In this translation of the Swedish by Peter Graves, the prose of Mr Englund agile but not extravagant, is perfectly adapted to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, it reflects the way in which the war has - despatched exceptionally uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred -
People begin to wonder why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books about World War I have often been indirect, such as The Great War and the modern memory of Paul Fussell, or novels like No novelty on the front of Erich Maria Remark, rather than integral stories.
Mr Englund's volume joins an unconventional pantheon.
His book has one of the most devastating endings I can remember in a nonfiction work.
I won't reveal it.
But it's as if he'd come from his book, pulled that dramatist personae page from between your fingers, and burned it with a cherries.
After a previous false step, a planned assault per minute
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing anti-disturb helmets.
The night of Monday was chosen on Tuesday because the Zuccotti Park would be more empty.
The operation was kept in secret except for a few high-ranking officers, initially telling others that they were joining an exercise.
Police inspector Raymond W. Kelly was at the centre, his presence emphasized how the operation was plagued with challenges for the police department.
Recent weeks could not be repeated, such as spray spraying peppers on protesters, violating the rules of the department and creating a storm of public sympathy towards the \"okupas\"
And that's why the police operation to clear the Zuccotti Park of protesters revealed after two weeks of planning and training.
Agents had been prepared to see how occupations had been developed in other cities.
A major catastrophe simulation was taking place on Randalls Island, with an eye looking towards Zuccotti.
Agents increased the so-called disorder training - counter-terrorism measures that involved rapidly mobilizing a large number of police officers - to focus on the Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
Orders to enter the park arrived in the last minute, said someone familiar with the orders, who referred to the mission only as - an exercise -
\"To the few cops I know who were called for this, they didn't tell them it was to enter the Zuccotti park,\" said the person, who spoke anonymously.
The only people who knew they were going to enter the Zucotti Park were at the highest levels in the department.
A reason for secrecy was a lesson learned from the city.
On 14 October, officers wanted to clear the park, but they gave up when hundreds of protesters emerged before long after hearing about the plans.
The Tuesday operation involved agents from several police units, including special forces from all over the municipal district - dozens of mobile agents who used to flood neighborhoods with high crime rates.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, like those who travel daily to work, had been going and coming from the park during the day, making 1 a.m. a good time to get in.
“It was appropriate to do so when there were the fewest people in the park,” he said.
Trucks from the Emergency Services Unit with spotlights and speakers gathered at the Pike Slip crossing with Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before leaving.
The pre-recorded lights and messages that retweeted from the speakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
Community affairs officers went to the park with their light blue wind, many protesters simply picked up their things and left.
No store was touched until 1:45 a.m., said the police, giving protesters time to collect their belongings.
Other teams of agents were seen meeting on the perimeter to enter if arrests were needed in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to abandon him.
Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesman for the Police Department, said it was for his safety.
But many journalists said that they tried to prevent police from coming into action in the park, and that they had been treated sharply by the agents.
Mr. Browne said that the mobile television units on Church Street, along the western edge of the park, were able to capture images.
As the police moved west through the dense wonder of personal effects of protesters, including bags of paper and plastic trash packed with clothes, teams of the Department of Cleanliness followed them, collecting what was left behind.
Some protesters who refused to move were dragged out, appearing images on the Internet soon afterwards.
A central group of protesters took positions near the camp kitchen area, near the center of the park.
Some made a barrier, and the police came in to arrest them methodically.
About 10 people in the camp's epicenter were lit among them by their arms.
And two people chained to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Emergency service agents were called to cut the locks.
No arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 a.m., said Mr. Kelly.
The clearance operation was completed about 75 minutes later, said the police.
Mr. Browne said about 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests were by - altering public order and resisting authority - he said.
The highest-ranking officer on the scene was Joseph J. Esposto, the head of the department, the senior uniformed officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the chief of detectives in the department, was there, too.
Mr. Kelly, while he was present, - he wasn't running operations - said Mr. Browne.
A second group of agents waited along the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar streets, in case they had to enter.
Barricades were erected on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block south.
From these positions, the police were seen extending the perimeter even beyond the Zuccotti park.
At one point, a number of agents, many of them with shields, were seen pushing people out.
There were about 28 people on the northern perimeter.
One of the most noisy action of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protestor jumped over the hood of a police car, and others were seen taking the air off the wheels of a police van.
At one point, a plywood piece flew out of the crowd.
In the end, an agent and a protestor were hospitalized.
The support workers' union will sue the city for dismissals
The union representing hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to sue the city on Wednesday, claiming that dismissals were unnecessary and discriminatory due to their disproportionate impact on schools attending poor students.
The demand is, possibly, the last weapon available to the union, of the municipal district 37, in its effort to revoke dismissals.
Sixty-two school assistants, parents' coordinators and other employees who were among the worst paid in the city lost their jobs on October 7, in a movement that trade union leaders have described as a political revenge for their refusal to allow, last spring, access by the city to a health care fund by working groups to close their budget gap.
The municipal authorities have categorically denied this charge.
At a hearing in the City Hall last month, the education adviser, Dennis M. Walcott, said that dismissals were a part of the approved budget in June.
One member of the Council countered by saying that nothing in the budget specified that members of the school support staff would be fired.
Municipal district officials 37 said that they filed the claim in writing, warning the Department of Education that it would be sued. A press conference will be held on Wednesday to announce the official filing of the application, at the Supreme State Court in Manhattan.
The lawsuit will include Mr. Walcott and the City Department of Education as accused, and has eight workers dismissed as plaintiffs, all of whom are black or Latin women, as well as most of the assistants who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesperson for the Legal Department of the city, said that the city had not seen the demand and therefore could not comment on its specific allegations.
According to a draft of The New York Times' demand, the union has focused on the number of dismissals in poor city schools to support an unfair treatment claim, saying that poor schools lost more attendees, as they had been insufficiently subsidized chronically.
It is noted that while there were no layoffs at Staten Island and a few layoffs at the schools at Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school assistants lost their jobs at District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were fired at Districts 8 and 9 in South Bronx.
Taking into account the loss of five of the eight assistants employed by Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68 per cent of students live in poverty, the demand says, \"This is not a neighborhood of trained parents who can raise funds to cover the budget deficit\"
Q.D. District budget 36 was reduced by 3.26 percent this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the way it calculated the additional funding for each enrolment by poor student in schools.
The union also states that secondary school directors may have been deceived by language in a memorandum authorizing the dismissal of parents coordinators.
The memorandum used the word \"exceeding\" to describe the action, even though, more often, it describes the act of moving a teacher of the payroll from a school to a work bag, whose salaries are paid by the central office.
\"Sixty-six parents' coordinators were fired,\" says the draft complaint, \"and not just in surplus.\"
Mission completed, Congress prepared to reach an agreement on Libya
It seems that eventually Republicans and Democrats in the Capitol are willing to agree on something related to the uprising in Libya.
All that was needed was for the rebellion to succeed, for the veteran dictator Muamar el Gadafi to be captured and killed and the United States' participation came to an end.
On Tuesday, the Senate's Foreign Affairs Committee will consider a resolution, sponsored by President John Kerry (Democrat for Massachusetts), along with Senators John McCain (Republican for Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (independent of Connecticut), applauding the Libyans for their successful rebellion and U.S. troops for their \"vantility\"
\"This resolution is to honor the braves of Libya, at the beginning of rebuilding their country,\" Kerry said.
- It is a two-party support statement for your democratic aspirations -
Language may seem harmless, but nothing about the debate on Libya has been easy so far.
This summer, the legislators of both parties fought with each other and with the White House on drafting a series of resolutions to approve or reject the role of the U.S. military in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution authorizing the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated in the House by a wide bipartisan margin, and it never got to vote in the Senate.
But on the same day that the bill was rejected in the House, the camera also rejected a measure that would have cut the funds for U.S. operations in Libya.
That left the U.S. mission in a kind of legislative purgatory - with Congress upset enough to criticize Obama's management of the mission, but not as angry as actually drying the grass under his feet.
Then, the indecision of Congress was overcome by events.
Tripoli fell into the hands of the Libyan rebels in August, and Gadafi was killed on 20 October.
NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate could be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs - congratulates the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and extraordinary resistance to free themselves - and - praises the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism -
The resolution also - declares the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya -
Will the new measure gain the full support of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, or will it divide the legislators as the bill of June did?
The latest version was rejected by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indian), the committee's main republican.
The spokesman for Lugar said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new bill.
On the other side of the Chapter, the House is going to vote this week on a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republican congressmen and some Democrats.
The measure, sponsored by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Republican by Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other item that actually results in a vote of the entire assembly in the House or Senate in this Congress.
Other legislators have not been successful so far to bring their amendments to the assembly, but not because of lack of attempts.
Goodlatte is only one of the 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced into this Congress, which cover a wide range of issues.
Some are duplicated - the same bill is proposed both in the House and in the Senate - and others with slight variations between themselves.
There are at least 15 versions of the amendment to the budget balance only in the House, and another handful that will control the federal expenditure.
Some of those bills are also identical to each other, but they give their sponsors - especially new Republicans who seek to refine their curricula - the opportunity to boast that they were the \"authors\" of that measure.
The Budget Control Act, which was passed in August, required that both the House and the Senate vote on an amendment to the budgetary balance.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of that amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members wanted to limit the number of mandates that members of Congress could fulfil, while representative José E. Serrano (Democrat for New York) wanted to remove the two-mandated limit for presidents.
Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat by Illinois) proposed a number of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care, among other issues.
An amendment prohibiting homosexual marriage is a perennial proposal, as well as one that prohibits the burning of flags.
Some legislators also want to allow the annulment of federal laws if they are rejected by two-thirds of the states.
As enthusiastic as the members have been when proposing amendments, they are not moving at a faster pace than in previous years.
At the 111th Congress, the legislators proposed 77 amendments, and presented 66 in the 110th.
The pace is unacceptable compared to that of the 1990s, when members regularly submitted more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they weren't much more successful then than they have now.
The last amendment, which was added - on 27 - was ratified in 1992, but was in fact proposed by the Congress in 1789.
“Golpeada but not defeated,” Giffords talks in his first TV interview since the shooting
Ten months after a gunman shot him to burn in a constituent act in Tucson, representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democrat for Arizona) appeared on national television on Monday night, sang along with Broadway's melody - The sun will come out tomorrow - and said he wanted to recover more than he wanted to return to Congress.
In his appearance at ABC News (20/20) with Diane Sawyer, Giffords struggled to form prayers and needed help to walk.
The program documented his difficult way back from the damage caused by a bullet that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of his brain, and that passed from the front to the back of his head.
Three months ago, he returned by surprise to the House to cast his triumphant vote on the debt ceiling agreement.
In his first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six and wounded 13, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and described his recovery as \"hard.\"
When Sawyer asked him how he felt, 41-year-old Giffords replied: \"Good enough.\"
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a “20/20” special one-hour program, which was issued on the eve of the publication of the new book of the couple, “Gabby: A history of courage and hope”
The special programme analysed the recovery of Giffords since the 8 January shooting.
In videos recorded by Kelly in the first few weeks, she is seen in her hospital bed, with a shaved head and a long scar going through her forehead.
She can only keep one or two fingers up, while her husband encourages her.
Months later, you see Giffords sitting in a wheelchair while therapists teach you how to perform simple actions.
A head movement.
A fruitfulness of the lips.
And then, his first word: “What”
In a few days, Giffords spoke another word - - all of them - a request for change in his breakfast menu.
Videos broadcast by ABC show that music played a central role in the recovery of Giffords: You see the congressman singing along with therapists the songs \"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun\" by Cyndi Lauper and \"Free Falling\" by Tom Petty.
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who spent two hours of therapy every day, said he doesn't remember the day of the shooting.
Her husband said he was reading to Giffords an article about the March 12 murder when she stopped him to ask for the first time about the six who had died in the incident.
The suspicious gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is detained in a Missouri prison and is being forcibly medicated while awaiting trial.
\"Many people died,\" Giffords told Sawyer.
\"Dury, hard, hard.\"
Kelly told Sawyer that at a time of his wife's recovery, she said, \"I've been defeated.\"
\"So, I told him, \"'Gabby, you haven't been defeated,\" said Kelly.
- You've just been hit.
And you're gonna get out of this, and you're gonna recover and you're gonna come back stronger than ever.
Troops make people feel more sorry than they respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad on impotence, frustration and loss.
At that time, several hundred soldiers, sailors, aviators, and marines burst into their posts around him.
The crowd of labels stood up and applauded.
“Men and women were considered heroes,” said David Saltzman, who organized the collection of spring funds.
A high-ranking military officer at the gala, also known as the then president of the Joint Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of troops differently.
“They showed them as a sort of orphaned child,” the officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know they had them.
But it wasn't respect, really.
The markedly contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship that has taken over the military and a often distant U.S. public, sometimes adoring.
Troops are given praise for their sacrifices.
But praise has a price, the members of the service say.
The public acts more and more as if it were pained by the uniformed ones.
\"We are not victims at all,\" said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who ordered the troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan.
\"But it seems that the only way some people show their support is to put us in the role of helpless souls\"
The issue is a very sensitive issue for military leaders, who do not want to appear unwelcome or disagree with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger faced by the troops who returned in the last years of the Vietnam War was much worse.
As a result, most of the talk about pity is held quietly and privately among war veterans.
After his two sons returned from fighting the Navy Infantry, the retired colonel Mark Cancian warned them that people other than the military would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with a feeling of fear because they faced the insurgents and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if there would be an \"enraged and violent veteran under the surface\" said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to a high-level government job in Washington.
During his job search, he said, felt that some interviewers had asked him subtly whether he would be able to endure under pressure from a demanding Washington job immediately after his combat tour.
“When you talk about your service, you need to deal with negative impressions,” Cancán reminded his children.
The military concern arises, in part, from American indifference to wars.
Achievements on the battlefield are rarely chosen for praise by a country that is not familiar with the military and sees little direct benefits from the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan.
“We, as a nation, no longer value military heroism in ways that were entirely common in World War II,” said Lieutenant General David Barno, who ordered U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
On the other hand, the praises of politicians and the public are largely focused on the depth of the suffering of a member of the service.
The troops are recognized by the number of tours they have endured, the number of friends who have lost or the extent of their injuries.
The army is facing increasing pressure to end the rape
This week, a historic hearing will decide whether 28 women and men have a case against the army for their alleged passiveness in the face of rape.
Otherwise, hundreds of plaintiffs are organizing for the next one.
First-time soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant the night she says she was raped by a partner.
It was October 2008, and he was headed back to his barracks at Miramar Air Base, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend when he met a colleague who was carrying a pack of 12 beers.
He asked if he could join her in her room for a drink.
\"It was an alarm signal,\" Lyman says.
However, the native of Texas left aside her concern.
I thought, no, it's 19.
\"He's from Texas,\" he says.
\"I wish I'd heard my instincts.\"
Within minutes of entering Lyman's room, the man approached him from behind, throwing her down and raping her, he claims.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other members of the current and former military personnel eagerly await a judicial decision in a historic trial to be held in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether the lawsuit against former Defence Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will proceed to trial.
The lawsuit claims that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to reduce the widespread violation among the military, in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
Presented in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., the lawsuit initially involved 17 plaintiffs, but grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all of whom claim that they were sexually raped or assaulted by their companions, and that the army failed when investigating, prosecuting, or giving proper justice after the alleged attacks.
Burke says he's going through the army's larger flat, because the problem starts with them.
\"The army is a top-down structure,\" he says.
\"Who are the people who are in a position to eradicate the culture of reprisals?
Burke also says that since February, nearly 400 more survivors have been contacted, many of whom could be part of future demands.
Your strategy: Instead of accumulating all the applicants in this case, by placing all the eggs in the same basket, so to speak, you will present several cases, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The Defence Team for the Department of Defense, led by federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, has submitted a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defence strategy - in essence, that the military cannot be sued by present or former soldiers for injuries suffered in the armed forces.
By a ruling of the Supreme Court of 1950 called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for the damage suffered by staff in active service.
“The alleged damage is part of the complainants’ military service,” the documents say.
The Department of Defence refused to comment on this article.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women are still officially forbidden to serve in combat, this distinction is only nominal: Modern wars rarely have clear front lines.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, women soldier teams are playing increasingly important roles, especially to reach local women in war zones.
The result: between these two wars, 150 women soldiers have died and two-thirds of them in combat situations.
It's time for the army to be modernized too, says Burke.
She is not alone in her struggle, and three other demands are underway, in addition to hers.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Services Clinic is preparing a case against the four main military academies for allegedly promoting a misogynistic environment.
On the other hand, the non-profit Vietnam Veterans of America is making up a lawsuit against the army that focuses on the diagnoses of \" personality disorder\" assigned to rape victims in order to give them a discharge of service - a common event, according to activists, such as Anu Bhagwati of the Women's Action Network in Service, a human rights group.
His group filed a complaint in December against the Veterans Administration, accusing it of discriminatory practices in the manner in which it handles claims of benefits for persons who claim to have been sexually assaulted in service.
Nine bills have been presented separately in Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing a number of corrections.
In 2010, there were 3,158 reported sexual assaults, according to the Office for the Prevention of Sexual Aggression and Response of the Department of Defence.
However, the attacks are markedly underreported, and by the Pentagon's own estimates, which amounts to approximately 13.5 percent of the 19,000 estimated incidents that year.
The report, published in March, also examines the prosecution rates: in 2010, 20 per cent of the reported cases in the army were at trial - half that in the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe their attacks as just the first of a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, he reported the alleged violation to the military police less than an hour after it happened.
That night, he says, he was asked to tell the details of his rape 11 times different from a crowd of cops, doctors, and commanders.
She submitted to a rape kit, and her aggressor's blood - from a cut in her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a hearing before a judge, during which he was asked about having had sexual intercourse with his boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six persons testified as witnesses of personality on behalf of the alleged author, who was finally acquitted.
\"I remember the day the verdict was read,\" Lyman says.
\"I thought I was going to work - I found myself screaming from the living room\"
\"They put me in the psychiatry unit, and when I left, I remember I told my commanding officer, \"That wasn't his judgment. That was my trial.\"
Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, who finally diagnosed him with a personality disorder, which made him unfit for service.
In January 2010 she was exempted from the service under less-than-honorable terms, which prevents her from receiving any benefits.
As to whether the case presented by Lyman and his fellow plaintiffs continues, it is a very remote possibility, says John Turley, law professor at George Washington Law School.
However, he points out, -In my view, they should be able to move on -
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first published.
I've been a permanent critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The army is decades behind because it does not have the same incentive and deterrence as the responsibility.
And he adds, \"The odds are strongly against them... but it's important for them to try it.\"
These things only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing is not on its way, Burke, a petitioner's attorney, will queue his other hundreds of plaintiffs for future cases.
\"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until the reform takes place,\" he says.
\"Or until we die, what happens first.
Walls have eyes: How researchers are studying you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just another guy who aired his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to having carried out a massacre in Norway in July, which left 77 dead, faced his first public hearing.
While Breivik may have acted alone, he was far from being alone in cyberspace: he had spent most of the time preceding his attack on his computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social networks.
After this summer's tragedy, the researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how do you find them?
Easy - you just have to get on Facebook.
\"We realized it wasn't that difficult to reach them,\" says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recently published report on European digital populism by the DEMOS British Center of Studies.
Facebook's personal information ring is so encyclopedic, says Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the advertising tool to determine their desired demographic characteristics with scientific accuracy - the way vendors have been using for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million right-wing group fans all over Europe and then sent them advertisements, but instead of linking them to a new band or diet product, the ads invited users to complete a survey that asked about their educational level, attitudes to violence and optimism about their own future.
Upon arriving through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to study more than 10,000 followers of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries - all without leaving the office.
\"It's a totally new way to do an investigation,\" says Bartlett.
Some of the results are not entirely surprising: Online supporters of right-wing groups tend to be young, men and angry at immigration.
However, in a kind of spin, those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain behind the computer screen.
DEMOS's work is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new and important tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centres, medical researchers and political scientists are using the site to study everything, from health problems to social trends as expressed in the -I like - messages on the walls and state updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content per day, Facebook’s “supernova of data” is generating a rise in research, boosting the number of academic works with the name of the site in the title to almost 800% in the last five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you could not approach with a folder on the street.
\"Before, when you were trying to poll people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them.\"
\"You should go through the party, and they would never allow you access,\" says Bartlett.
\"Facebook eliminates all that - you go to them directly\"
Others say the site could provide a way to identify and address health-social problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno, University of Wisconsin-Madison and her colleagues found that college students who spoke about their drunken exploits on Facebook had a significantly greater risk of having drinking problems than students who remained silent about the subject.
Moreno suggests that students' peers, such as residential counsellors, could control the site and intervene to help a student who publishes too many state updates with their drunks.
\"You can't deal with a problem if you can't diagnose it,\" said Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Moreno and director of the Children's Health, Behavior and Development Center at the Seattle Children's Research Institute, Washington Post.
“We have found a way to identify children at risk who would otherwise not be diagnosed”
Facebook is also constantly - blinking - to its own population to obtain data.
The Site Data Team has developed statistics on the status of the relationship and Valentine's Day, the expectation of electoral participation in the middle of the 2010 legislative period, and an index of National Happiness (mainly using the information that can be accessed - digital freedom advocates long ago hold that the site should make available to others its large amount of data for research).
However, Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not - the sacrifice for being able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away is to allow the site to mine your personal information.
But what happens when Facebook users become part of a survey they don't even know?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect their data offline, online is a free bar for everyone.
“I don’t think many of the users have even thought about the fact that a researcher might be examining their profiles,” says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, about a 2006 study that carried out with the public walls of Facebook of students.
\"As far as they were concerned, it was only between them and their friends.\"
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even out of line, there is no guarantee that a research topic is being completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know what part of the user profile information and wall messages are true.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do off Facebook are two completely different things,” Selwyn says.
That is why, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn believes that a clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools no one can use.
\"There is no substitute for entering the real world and talking to real people,\" he says.
\"Social research is supposed to be about social -- and a lot of social is still happening out of line\"
“Frior and inhumane: Anders Behring Breivik makes his first public appearance in court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to be the brain of the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has been described himself as a \"resistance\" fighter during his first public appearance in the Oslo court.
\"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and in the Norwegian Temple Knights,\" he said in front of a hall full of 500 people.
\"I oppose the court because it has been mandated by organizations that support the ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism.\"
\"I recognize the facts, but I do not plead guilty.\"
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during that monologue, because - he didn't want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this audience as a platform for expressing his views -
For the same reason he refused to allow Breivik, who had given a written speech in advance, to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, prohibited him from accessing the media for four weeks, and said that the authorities would have to have strict control over all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came in hopes to look at Breivik in the eye, others to confirm that he is locked up.
They all attended with the aim of moving towards the conclusion.
\"I thought it looked cold and inhuman,\" said a Utoya survivor to the Norwegian NRK station.
\"It was uncomfortable, but for me it was a step forward after seeing and hearing the suspect.\"
Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the audience and looked at the journalists and survivors in the eyes when he entered and left the building.
Despite Breivik's strange notion of being a part of a greater “resistance” movement, the judge determined that he is not a mentally ill, and said that there is no evidence that he would act with accomplices.
It may be that some are advised that the 22 July attacks appear to be the work of an extremist instead of a group of radicals.
But that does not automatically soften the pain and confusion that a whole nation still feels.
\"I'd like it to look like a monster, but it doesn't seem so,\" said a victim's family member.
\"It would be much easier if it looked like it.\"
7 Lessons from Steve Jobs' Lost Interview, are shown in a theater this week
After the death of Steve Jobs, on October 5, there were some who compared it with Henry Ford - distinguishing the genius of technology as the Great Modern Inventor.
But what Apple fans could find more revealing, in an recently rediscovered Job interview to which they have disempolated as the advancement of a series of special projections in the largest markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood about the business processes and workflows of the products.
He was no doubt a self-recognized designer, dreamer and hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer and a youngki of flow diagrams - a man who believed many executives were suffering - a disease that consists of thinking that a great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] there is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product -
In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the television series The Triumph of the Nerds (The Triumph of the Nerds) on the dawns of the personal computer, and sat for more than an hour with Jobs for an extensive and rare conversation.
At that time, only 10 years had passed since Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, and he was already working hard on his new NeXT computer company, waiting for popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringely's interview was used in Nerds, he said that the originals of the interview disappeared during his transportation.
It was only after Job's death that a complete copy was discovered in VHS in the director's garage.
This slightly republished file material is the basis of Steve Jobs: The 68-minute missing interview that reaches the Landmark cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known for hating in-depth interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly willing to expose their technological philosophies and commercial strategies.
And very thoughtful.
In four different points throughout the interview, there are great silences between questions and answers - from 10 to 15 seconds of reflections, where Jobs is clearly weighing his thoughts, searching for accuracy.
There are also times when Job's perfectionism comes to the surface, where he seems impatient because of Cringely's questions, pushing him to go faster to the issues or arguments of greater importance.
Filmed before the Pixar era, the iPod or the iPhone, there is something oddly prophetic in The Lost Interview, when Jobs evaluates what other companies see doing well and bad, and offers their own vision of the future of computer science.
One thing is to read posthumous evaluations of Job's career, but there is something crude and inspiring in the Jobs we see here, the dreamer anxious to the edge of greatness.
He has a vision of how they can and should be things.
Not long after explaining everything in detail here, he went and did.
A quick summary of seven notable sequences of The Lost Interview:
About how he learned how to run a business:
\"Over the years in business, I've always asked, \"Why do you do things, and the answers that give you invariably are: \"Oh, that's just the way it's done.\"
No one knows why he does what he does, no one in business thinks about things very deeply.
That's what I found.
Jobs brings to detail their efforts to simplify Apple's accounting.
Disconcerted by the form in which the costs were recorded - often starting with a - standard cost - that was made to the eye of good cover, and then adjusted with a -variable - developed an automated factory that ensured that they could determine the commercial costs in detail.
About the Pope's joke:
Jobs tells the Blue Box that he himself built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to effectively hack the phone company and make long-distance calls for free.
It has been written extensively about the device, but Jobs' euphoria here in describing the Blue Box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
Describes how he and Wozniak tested the box by using a public phone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT & T network to another, while creating a loop with as many satellites as possible.
“We were wrapping things around the world a half a dozen times and screaming through the public phone and returning a minute later to the public phone at the door next door,” Jobs says with a laugh.
\"We were young and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that could control billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world\"
We both, we didn't know much, but we could build a small thing that could control a giant thing - it was an incredible lesson, and I don't think there'd ever been Apple without it.
Jobs continues to describe a glorious joke that he and Wozniak almost abandon, calling the Vatican through the Blue Box in the middle of the night and asking to speak with the Pope while doing his best imitation of Henry Kissinger.
As several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak with the American diplomat, the two broke into carcasses just before the very Pope was awakened to answer the phone.
About falling in love with technology (and selling by phone with Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, when hunting spare parts to build a frequency counter, Bill Hewlett was asked in the phone book and made a call.
Shortly after his 20-minute telephone conversation, Jobs got a part-time summer job in Hewlett-Packard.
\"That was a remarkable influence on me, it was the only company I had seen at that age and formed my vision of what a company was and how well they treated their employees\"
Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw - the first table computer ever made -
It was as big as a suitcase, it had a small cathode tube screen, and I fell in love with it.
I would get a trip to HP as a teenager and waste my time on that machine and write programs for her.
On Improvising Innovation:
At various points in the interview, Jobs talks about inventing new products on the march.
Soon in his career, as he dedicated himself to selling a handful of base cards, he asked a client if he could assemble the whole team.
Working with only 30 credit days, I had to figure out the assembly and delivery of finished devices.
Later, while in Apple, he recalls the struggles he faced in developing a computer mouse:
“I remember having dramatic arguments... they shouted to me that it would take five years [to create a mouse that would cost $300], and I got tired and went out and found a designer.
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build for 15 dollars and that was completely reliable.
On large companies losing strength:
Long before he led Apple's rebirth, Jobs prophetically predicted the way many industry leaders would stumble in their vision, and lose control of their market share.
“Tells you work in IBM or Xerox, so you make better photocopiers and printers, and what”
You have the monopoly of market share, so the company is no longer successful.
The sales and marketing departments increase the success, so it is this kind of people who end up driving companies and product managers are expelled from the decision-making forum.
The genius of the products that led to this monopoly position is rotting because of people who do not have the notion of good products vs bad products - the knowledge of the necessary trade.
That's what happened in Xerox...
Xerox could have belonged to the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times its size, it could have been the Microsoft of the 1990s...
They took the defeat of victory.
About innovation as an artistic expression:
\"There is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product...as the great idea evolves, it changes and grows\"
Much is learned about the subtleties of it.
There are sacrifices you have to make - some things you can't make the electrons, the glass makes them, the robots do them, the factories do them.
You have to keep 5000 things in your brain - these concepts - adjust them all at once...
In the end everything is reduced to the taste - it declines to try to expose you to the best that a team of humans has done, and then try to adapt those things to which you are doing.
Picasso said the good artists copy, the great artists steal.
We've never been ashamed of stealing great ideas.
What partly made Macintosh great was that the people who were working on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who were casually the best computer scientists in the world.
If it wasn't for computer science, it could be doing wonderful things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas dinner with the rivals of the health care law while the court accepts the case
On the day that the Supreme Court met in private to discuss the politically controversial issue of whether they would accept the challenge to the health care law of President Obama, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were served at a dinner sponsored by the firm of lawyers who will expose the case to the high court.
The occasion was last Thursday, when the nine judges met at a preliminary hearing to carefully study requests for review.
One of the cases in question was a lawsuit filed by 26 states challenging the total reform of health care approved by Congress last year, a law that has been a war cry for conservative activists across the country.
The judges agreed to take the case and, in fact, an historic claim of 5 and a half hours is expected for March, and the result will likely further cloud the 2012 presidential career that will be in full swing at the time the court's decision is heard.
The lawyer who will appear before the court and will claim that the law must be discarded will probably be Paul Clement, who served as U.S. Attorney General during George W. Bush's government.
Clement's firm of lawyers, Bancroft PLLC, was one of almost two dozen companies that helped to sponsor the Federalist Society's annual dinner, a group that has been dedicated to the defense of conservative legal principles for many years.
Another signature that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., who has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the dispute.
Dinner was held at a hotel in Washington, hours after the court's preliminary hearing on the case.
Among the attendees was Mitch McConnell, the most important republican in the Senate and a declared opponent of the Health Care Act.
Special guests at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
It's nothing new: The two judges have been attending Federalist Society events for years.
And it's not something that conflicts with ethical norms.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct governing the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they were not, it could be said that they would fall under the Canon 4C Code, which says: “A judge may attend events to raise funds from law-related organizations and others, even though the judge cannot be a speaker, an honored guest, or appear on the agenda of such an event.”
However, the absolute proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms in the case, as well as to a company with enormous financial interest, was sufficient to alarm ethics activists in the government.
“This impressive gap in ethics and indifference to the code runs counter to the demands of several judges who follow the court by the same rules that apply to all federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, President of Common Cause (Common Cause).
\"The judges were assisted in a collection of gala funds with lawyers who have pending cases before the court\"
Its appearance and assistance in fundraising for this event undermines any demand for impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest in the criticism that they are too easily mixing the activity of the court with the agenda driven by groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a prominent conservative activist.
On the other hand, conservatives argue that it is the magistrate Elena Kagan, who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan worked as general prosecutor of the Obama administration when the first legal challenges were presented to the law in the court of first instance.
His critics have pressed for Kagan to refrain from seeing the case, saying that he was too involved in defending the law as now being impartial.
Kagan has given no indication that he's going to do it.
Boeing receives a record request of $18 billion
The Emirates airlines request 50 Boeing 777 double-pass aircraft, with an option of 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner planes to Oman Air, an operation valued at over $1 billion.
It is rarely news when a company gets an order of 50 units from its product.
But it's a big deal when the company is the manufacturer of Boeing Co. planes and the selling price for the 50 planes goes up to a record of 18 billion dollars.
It is as big as the place where Boeing received the order: Middle East, a gold mine in growth of future aircraft orders.
In a study released on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that for the next 20 years airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion.
Boeing announced during the weekend his greatest order in history for commercial aircraft for its value in dollars - 50 Boing 777 double-passed jets.
The successful request came from the Emirates airline in Dubai.
The airline also has an option to buy 20 more aircraft, which would raise the total selling price to $26 billion, announced Boeing at the Dubai Aeronautical Hall 2011.
Then, on Monday, Boeing said that Oman Air had requested six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which presumed a fuel savings and services for spectacular passengers.
The selling price for six of them is over $1 billion.
“This clearly has a huge positive effect for Boeing,” said Morningstar Neal Dihora’s analyst.
-The quality of these customers in particular is very strong -
Many Middle East airlines are owned by their oil-producing nations.
Therefore, they not only have the money to pay the planes, but an increase in fuel prices - usually detrimental to the airlines, because it is one of the biggest costs - is not so detrimental, because the country is making money with the increase in the price of oil.
That is important because they are less likely than other airlines to cancel or delay flight orders when fuel prices increase, Dihora said.
\"They have natural protection,\" he said.
The Emirates' request solidifies Boeing's leadership in the wide fuselage aircraft market and helps keep the airbus SAS competitor's attempt to invade their domain with the A350 passenger aircraft.
Boeing's victory at the air fair took place four months after Airbus said it was going to delay the debut of the largest A350, which competes directly with 777-300ER.
He retracted the debut to add more momentum after customers demanded an increase in the payload and rank.
Boeing Co's shares rose by 1.5% to $67.94.
The sister of the President of Mexico, apparently defeated in the vote of Michoacán
Luisa Maria Calderón states that drug traffickers helped their PRI opponent, Fausto Vallejo, in the governor's contest.
President Felipe Calderón's sister seems to have lost her application to governor of Michoacán during the elections of the violent state, and she said on Monday that drug traffickers helped to tilt the race for one of her opponents.
The preliminary results gave the lead in the career for governor of the Western state to Fausto Vallejo, of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
“The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process and, especially yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoacán, but for the whole country,” said Luisa María Calderón in a radio interview one day after the Sunday vote.
They threatened our candidates, our electoral workers... took over the polls, set up barricades... and ordered the people to vote in favour of the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.
However, it is the setting-up of a return, and victory in Michoacán is an important step in that effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential elections in July.
Vallejo seems to have outpaced Calderón, who had led the polls before the elections.
Calderón, a candidate for the Conservative National Action Party of his brother, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the left-wing candidate for the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, currently in office as governor, was third, a major defeat for the divided left and unfortunate before the 2012 presidential elections.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results.
Vallejo, mayor of the state capital of Morelia, denied links with drug trafficking and urged the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by marihuana, heroin and methamphetamine drug cartels.
It is the birth status of President Calderón, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive directed against traffickers in December 2006.
However, violence has persisted.
A mayor of the NAP was killed a week before the elections while campaigning for Luisa María Calderón, and numerous candidates quit the local applications for fear.
Although for the PRI, however unpleasant the Michoacán elections seem, a victory will help boost the party.
The man who is supposed to represent the PRI in the presidential election, Enrique Peña Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said: \"I think this victory should be very encouraging, towards the next year -
BAsD urges Asia to help rescue the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (BAsD) has called on India and China to prepare to help rescue the eurozone from its sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term recession that would prevent the growth of Asian economies.
Mr. Rajat Nag, Director General of the Asian Development Bank based in Manila, said that the two world's fastest growing economies had to do everything possible to accelerate the recovery of the economic bloc either through the International Monetary Fund or directly through bilateral agreements.
He warned against the BRIC [Brazil, Russia, India, China] countries that observe Europe's difficulties in a “partial” way and said that Asia's financial assistance along with European leadership and resources would help to avoid a long-term crisis in the global economy.
\"We're all in this together\"
“So anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful,” he told the Financial Times in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
‘Asia can be protected to some extent, but it cannot be immune’
\"So if China and India can help, be it by all means\"
European monetary union has been severely undermined by a sovereign debt crisis in recent months.
In the last few days, the indebtedness costs of Italy have been dangerously fired and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The current sovereign debt crisis in Europe has increased fears that it could push the world economy into recession and has generated calls for major emerging economies to join together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channelled through the IMF, but said that bilateral assistance - such as the purchase of EU rescue fund bonds, the European Financial Stability Fund - provided greater bargaining power for Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, Indian Minister of Commerce, said that India will do everything possible to help the eurozone as its own economy was now suffering the decline of exports and the depletion of foreign capital inflows.
“No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent,” he said.
\"We have monumental challenges and we have to maintain a high level of growth\"
\"It's not an option, it's an imperative, because where we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women\"
Others argue that developing economies like India have no responsibility to help rich Europeans when faced with their own and deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at Brown University in the U.S., said it would be politically very difficult to sell aid to Europe for the two billion people in India, of whom up to 800 million live with about $2 a day or less.
\"At some point they will realize that the Greeks retire at the age of 50 and go on vacation to the beaches and that will not go well,\" he said.
Lee Howell, managing director of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India's reserves should be used to maintain the many well-paid workers in the Greek public sector, in jobs of poorly managed companies, and those who generate losses such as railways.
Mr Nag said that the Eurozone crisis threatens - important chain effects - across Asia.
The forecast of the Asian Development Bank of 7.5 percent of economic growth in Asia for 2011/12 is now faced with the \"risks down\" due to the threat of Europe.
He said that vulnerable emerging markets needed to make contingency plans to protect themselves from a crisis and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Serious warnings from the Pentagon about possible cuts in defense
The Secretary of Defense, Leon Panetta, warmed Congress on Monday, warning that the automatic budget cuts attached to them could undermine national security and lead to a chained financial reaction from the Pentagon corridors, to the Afghanistan battlefields, to the civil assembly chains.
The Pentagon is already digesting the $450 billion of reductions over the next decade, but now it fears an additional reduction of 600 billion or more in cuts that may be imminent if Congress does not reach an agreement on spending.
“The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the department,” Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, a Republican for Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, a Republican for South Carolina.
He said that Congress's failure to reach an agreement on the budget and its consequence, the so-called \"sequencing\" would result in 23 percent of global reductions and a halt to many new projects.
Such a large cut, applied in this indiscriminate way, would make most of our naval and construction projects impossible to run - you can't buy three quarters of a boat or a building - and seriously damage other modernization efforts - wrote Panetta to the senators.
\"We would also be forced to leave many of our civilian officials unintentionally and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, it is almost certain that we would have to license civilians in order to achieve the objective\"
“These changes would break faith with those who maintain our army and seriously damage the good disposition”
The cuts in time would reach the combat troops, Panetta said.
\"Although wartime funding in the offshore contingency operations accounts is not directly affected by kidnapping, war efforts would be negatively affected by serious core budget disturbances,\" Panetta said.
- Recruitment of staff would be reduced, leading to delays in contracts and monitoring of the war-supporting contract.
“Nomine staff would be reduced, resulting in delays in payments to wartime providers, and legal and political support would be interrupted”
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for information about the possible impact of automatic cuts on the Department of Defense.
“The consequence of a kidnapping in the Department of Defense would result in a rapid decline in the United States as the world’s leading military power”
\"We are firmly opposed to this draconian action,\" Senators said in a joint communiqué on Monday afternoon when Panetta's letter was published.
\"This is not a result with which one can live, and certainly is not one that we should impose ourselves on ourselves\"
- Kidnapping is a threat to the interests of the national security of the United States, and should not be allowed to occur.
If the Panetta letter and the Senators' recent warnings will increase the pressure for a budget commitment or intensify calls to exempt the Pentagon from cuts it is to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly frank about possible cuts, although she has come to work on the top of the Pentagon with years of budget experience in Congress and the White House and knowing that she was facing difficult decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defense painted a grim picture of what might be ahead - an army with a shell, but not a core.
\"It's a boat without sailors.\"
It's a bulletless brigade.
\"It's an air wing without enough trained pilots\"
“It’s a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers to carry out the mission,” Panetta said in her opening words at the Pentagon.
\"It is a force that suffers from moral decline, poor preparation and is not able to keep up with potential opponents.\"
\"Indeed, he invites the aggression.\"
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta sets out new details of how reductions - generating significant operational risks - delay in the time of response to crises, conflicts and disasters; severely limits our ability to be deployed and previously committed throughout the world; and poses an unacceptable risk to future combat operations -
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defence projects could face the axe, including those that are already being tested and some only in the early stages of planning.
This list includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a new planned bomber, the new-generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal combat boat and the new ground combat vehicle that the Army and the Navy need to replace, the Humvee.
Stopping the development and additional testing of the F35 could generate about $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say it is the next vital step in improving and addressing the potential threats of China and other rivals.
How to Detect a Lie
A look at the most recent headlines tells us how serious and omnipresent lies and deceit are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging accusations of sexual harassment with several women; each party accuses each other of lying to the other.
The administrators of Pennsylvania State University have been accused of perjury for allegedly concealing reports that a retired football coach was sexually assaulting children.
Last week, French President Nicolás Sarkozy was \"pulled\" with an open microphone stating to the President of the United States, Barack Obama, that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lying has destroyed careers and convulsed countries.
The congressman for New York and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made the ridiculous with his disgruntled quickly defeated by the irrefutable test.
The former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with offences in the financing of the campaign related to the covering of an extramarital relationship.
And again, no one who lived will ever forget the media circus unleashed by President Bill Clinton by lying during his second term about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Legends about traps are widespread in school and university exams.
There have been cases in which teachers have given student test responses in order to be better seen in their performance assessments.
Mentors who should be teaching the contrary are sending the message that lying and cheating are acceptable.
How much deception do we find ourselves?
In any day, studies show that they can lie to you anywhere from 10 to 200 times.
That's for sure, many of those lies are godly lies.
Another study showed that the strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes to meet.
To detect lies, or - the location of lies - is an essential skill that we must acquire all, for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a table game similar to, for example, Charada, where the goal is to exclaim: \"I have you\" the detection of deception is a branch of serious knowledge based on scientific data obtained during the past six decades at prestigious universities that conducted research projects in depth, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the old myths about lying have been rebutted.
The liars do look in the eye.
They don't always stutter, babbling, rustling or restless.
Nor can it be concluded that liars are difficult to detect or unmask.
A trained lie detector can come to the truth by learning about the structure of the statement, the microfacial expressions, the formation of questions and times.
I spent several years examining scientific discoveries about deception in the vast and always emerging body of knowledge, and it was clear that detection of deception is a modern technique that is easy to learn and helps to navigate our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include recruitment, interviews, or negotiation management.
Good liars have the ability to read well to others, making them feel at ease, handling their own emotions and intuitively feeling how others perceive them.
We know from the research that extroverts lie more than the introverts, that men say more - lying towards themselves - while women say more lies - oriented towards others - - usually to protect someone's feelings - that married people lie less often to their couples than people who are not married (but the lies they usually say tend to be - huge).
We also know that if you are perceived as a evildoer, others will feel less guilty when lying to you.
How do you know if someone's lying?
First, observe the subject's usual behavior.
This is called - creating a baseline -
Helps to provide benchmarks for later measurement of changes.
Observe the posture of the subject, laughter and vocal characteristic.
It is better to know if someone usually hits with their feet all the time to not make unfair accusations when he sees his feet beating in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for misleading, verbal and nonverbal groups of behavior.
Consider these behavior groups as warning signals, not as evidence of deception.
People who cheat can freeze the upper part of the body by trying to remember their story, they can point their feet towards the door, lean towards a exit, change their posture significantly, or display a post-interview dump -- that exaggerated sigh of relief and change of posture once all the difficult questions are over.
The questioners often falsely see that the interview is only finished to seek that post-interview relief.
It also pays attention to the subject's vocabulary.
Scott Peterson put his foot to the bottom and used the past time as he claimed that his murdered wife was alive, launching a national search for her.
People who cheat can also use a distancing language: \"I didn't have sexual relations with that woman... Miss Lewinsky - or repeat a difficult question in its entirety.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of - restrictive language - when he answers a difficult question: -Well... to tell the truth... until I know... to my understanding -
This makes the answer a perception rather than a fact and is often a warning sign.
There is no magic formula to detect lies, but developing skills to discover deception is possible.
These skills will improve the possibilities of anyone to avoid being victimized by scam artists in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial plan of the diverted pipeline following the threat of U.S. delay in approval
Days after Obama's administration threatened to delay the approval of a planned pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- angering the trade unions, as it appeased the environmentalists -- the company that seeks to build the pipeline says it is willing to redirect the project to reroute it.
TransCanada said on Monday night that it will move the planned pipeline out of the ecologically sensitive Sandhills area in Nebraska, and trusts that the project will win approval.
The company announced the decision at the press conference in the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada's director, Alex Pourbax, says that the company maintains its confidence that the pipeline will eventually be approved, although it is true that with a different route.
This follows the announcement last week by the Department of State that they would delay the decision by a federal permit for the project until further potential routes to avoid the Sandhills areas of Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, a vast supply of groundwater, are studied.
\"This is a real path of progress,\" said representative Lee Terry, a republican from Nebraska, to Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the Department of State may separate any decision until 2013, after the next year's elections, although officials denied that the policy was involved in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the State Department's request, and expressed their full support.
The 1,700 mile [1,700 km] pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would take 700,000 barrels a day from Alberta province to the refineries in Texas.
To do so, it would be necessary to cross six states.
He is hated by the environmentalists, but loved by the working groups, who have bet on the estimate of 20,000 oil-related jobs.
But the legislators of Nebraska opposed to the plan are under the legislation to force a removal from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala aquifer, the largest source of drinking water and irrigation.
The Department of State's current environmental impact study found that the project only posed limited adverse environmental impacts, but the source of the energy industry said that the department's general inspector had ordered an independent test of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is if the lobby member hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliot, who was a campaign advisor to Hillary Clinton in 2008, represents a conflict of interest to the program.
The other is if a signature that was hired to conduct the original study was an inappropriate choice because it was linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly causing a child to vomit out of fear
A New York family claims that the disco diva, Patti LaBelle, behaved like a madman in the lobby of his Manhattan building, landing his little daughter to the point that he threw up in fear.
The diatribe of the singer of “Lady Marmalade” frightened 18-month-old Genevieve Monk, so much so that he suffered - personality changes, sleep disorders - and - increased his fear of strangers - says his family in the Manhattan Supreme Court.
It was on November 10 last year when Tramoist Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were getting ready to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was taking the car, Roseanna Monk went down to the lobby of the Riverside Boulevard building, carrying his luggage, taking Genevieve.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and put her daughter on the floor for a moment.
\"Someone came up from behind and told me, \"Do you know what your daughter is doing?\" I said, \"Yes, and I went to pick her up,\" she said.
LaBelle was angry with the pregnant woman.
\"He said in an aggressive tone, \"I shouldn't have left his daughter near the door,\" said Roseanna Monk.
\"I told you, \"I have no interest in what you say or think.\"
He got angry and started using bad words - the word C and the word J aloud...
He had a bottle of water and started throwing the water out of the bottle on me.
He said Genevieve went hysterical.
\"I told this woman, \"Look what you've done to my daughter,\" said the girl's mother.
LaBelle shook over the mother -- who was still holding Genevieve -- and had to be contained by her surroundings and removed from a car that was waiting for her, Roseanna Monk said.
The little girl was crying so loud she threw up, she added.
Later, the family sent a note requesting an apology from LaBelle, but he did not get an answer.
The lawyer and representatives of LaBelle did not return calls to comment on what happened.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, but family attorney Sam Davis said he took the case for free and the family plans to donate all the money it can to a supportive association for children with cancer.
“The purpose is to make Patti LaBelle responsible for his conduct,” Davis said.
\"This type of behavior is completely unacceptable, especially when addressing a kindergarten teacher who carries an 18-month-old child in his arms\"
Climate adversity brake the economy
During the first year of management by Mario López Valdez, Sinaloa has increased unemployment and informality, lowered foreign investment and contracted the economy
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, this is the first year of the government of Mario López Valdez, self-denominated of change, which generated high expectations regarding the advances in the economy, but given the climate adversity of the beginning of the year, no growth is observed, but there is a deterioration in the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures of February, in addition to causing millions of losses for the agricultural sector, limited the possibilities of the state economy to grow, caused a contraction of economic activity in general by 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, mainly justified by the historic fall of 31.16 percent in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of the other economic sectors.
According to the report of effects on ice cream, issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, damage was done in 582 thousand 835 hectares, of which 78.03 per cent suffered total damage and the remaining 21.07 per cent had partial damage, the main sinister crops were those of vegetables, corn and chickpeas.
The fall in economic activity has generated, up to November, a steady rise in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the rate of state unemployment during the first three quarters of the year was seen as an accelerated growth, as while from January to March 55 thousand 053 signageans were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53% of the Economically Active Population, for the second quarter the rate rose to 5.28 percent, and between July and September the average continued to increase to 6.19 percent, a rate that in number of people drops to more than 74,000 unemployed people, an increase in respect of the first half of 18 billion 969 individuals.
Lower liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, for economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the School of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly, depending on the actions that have been carried out since public policy.
“What is being seen is a rise in unemployment that has to do with several factors, including the loss of liquidity on the market for the effects of a restriction of resources by the legislation adopted at the congress to combat money laundering, already for people who take dollars illegally it is not easy for them to work, invest them and use them in something,” he said.
Migrating stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that there is also a demographic factor in increasing unemployment.
“The number of people leaving the state seeking work abroad, in the United States has been restricted, first by the difficulties to enter, and second because they already have many difficulties to find work, those people are staying and demanding sources of work here in the state, which causes unemployment to rise,” he said.
Informality
The analysis of the labour market is aggravated by considering the high level of informality prevailing among working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 percent of the population employed in the state works without being contributing as a worker to any social security institution.
In addition to unemployment and informality, another of the state's labour prices are low wages, the entity has the lowest wages in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Institute for Social Security and the Ministry of Labour and Social Security.
The average monthly income of signal workers was, until September, 5 thousand 352 pesos, well below the national average, located in 7 thousand 375 pesos.
IED Contraction
In addition to the fall in economic activity and the rise in unemployment, during 2011 the largest decrease in foreign direct investment over the past 10 years, according to the Ministry of Economics from January to June of the State FDI amounted to $630,697, representing a decrease of 87.74 per cent over the $5 million 143,312 recorded during the same period of the previous year.
For its part, the Secretariat for Economic Development of the State Government accounts for a total investment of 17 billion 280 million pesos in the year, mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.
Debt
In the light of the economic contraction scenario, the State Government asked the State Congress in July to approve a loan of 3 billion pesos, which would be aimed at investing in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, in order to revive the economy, the approval of the local congress amounted to 2 billion pesos, and until November did not observe the benefits of indebtedness in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
For business sector representatives, Mario López Valdés' first year of government shows a lack of government management capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, said that during 2011 there was a lack of harmonization of the wills of the different sectors, including the State Government itself.
\"The performance of the economy in Sinaloa during this year has been really poor, we must work hard to recover the land we lost this year, in 2012 we have to redouble efforts, failed to align the effort of all and above all the good progress already synchronized of this new team of government, we hope that next year will be much better,\" he said.
Economic slowness
Loredo López stated that events such as ice cream at the beginning of the year stopped the state economy and restricted its performance and growth.
“The low economic flow is the product of several events, including frosts, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not return fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows to have an acceptable level of flow in processes, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we are closing much below the expectations we had,” he mentioned.
Redefine vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, President of the Mexican Republic's Patronal Confederation in Sinaloa, he stated that it is necessary to refer the state to productive activities of greater dynamism.
“In general terms we have observed that it has been working, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme in which the vocation and economic direction of the state is redefined, because it is important that the full potential of the material and human resource that Sinaloa has is detonated,” he said.
Work to be done
The President of Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that best fits the Government's efforts.
\"In general terms, I would say that the Government has been trying to achieve good results in different areas, in terms of economic development there are some progress, but it is important that a long-term programme be developed,\" he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in conducting public policy.
\"There are elements that allow to say that the Government is being more inclusive, I can say that there is work done and I think the Government is aware that there is work to be done,\" he said.
They condemn it for 8 kg of marijuana
Five years in prison and 100 days in a fine was sentenced to a neighbor of Navolato for the possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Attorney-General of the Republic reported that the convicted narcomenudist is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for the offence of against health, in his variant of possession of marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to file AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by elements of the Mexican Army, on June 7, 2010, in a surveillance operation on Cipriano Valdez Street, opposite the 80th post, in the town of El Castillo, Navolato.
The narcomenudist circulated in a pick up truck, white, where he carried a black bag in the vehicle box and in the copilot seat a small backpack, where the military found eight kilograms 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the insured person was at the disposal of the Second District Judge and the sentenced person continues to serve in the Centre for the Enforcement of the Legal Consequences of the Crime.
You must make contributions for works
Social works covered in programs such as Habitat, Public Space Rescue and 3x1 for migrants are at risk of not being completed or of being seriously delayed due to the lack of economic resources, Miguel Ángel López Miranda said.
The Director of Municipal Social Development indicated that while the work programmes have advanced so far, they are at risk of failing to comply with the State Government's contributions corresponding to it, which constitute a resource of more than 11 million pesos in the three programmes.
He noted that the total investment in these three programmes is almost 50 million pesos, of which the State is 25 per cent and that only the Federation and the Municipality have so far provided resources for the works, so that the possible delay in the conclusion of the works is made effective.
\"It's almost 12 million what's up to them to contribute, and even though the year is about to end, they haven't given us a fifth, when they've been giving us a share since July,\" he said, \"we haven't started the works and they're going to be very advanced, but we need the money.\"
He mentioned that last year, in the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State failed to comply with their corresponding contributions, so at the beginning of the administration the municipality had to apply for a credit to cover the more than 7 million that did not contribute at that time to the state administration.
“We had already spent in the previous sex because the State did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programmes continued to walk, and this year we had to get the resources to cover what the State left pending,” he explained.
Despite the State authorities ' commitment to comply with the delivery of these resources, he commented that the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, had been asked to speed up the efforts to ensure that their respective percentages would reach them as soon as possible.
\"It's almost 12 million what you're going to contribute, and even though the year is about to end, they haven't given us a fifth.\"
Valid court - analog apagon - in Mexico in 2015
Replacement of analog digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has had in recent years
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) dismissed constitutional disputes brought by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the presidential decree leading to the so-called \"analog apagon\" from 2021 to 2015, not to assemble the eight votes needed to invalidate it.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his responsibilities by issuing the decree detailing the actions to be taken to concrete the transition to digital terrestrial television.
With that result, the constitutional dispute promoted by the Senate of the Republic was dismissed for failing to reach the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to pronounce on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and it remains in force.
The draft ruling, drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed to declare the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of radio and television matters is a power reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and reservation of law.
In favor of the project only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero themselves voted.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional disputes to challenge the decree, and by admitting the demands, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and of all the actions in it arranged for the digital transition.
The full number of ministers also resolved to dismiss the request filed by the House of Deputies, without entering the discussion of the project, also by Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the president minister said that he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the federal executive cannot structure the measures for the public administration to be prepared through general rules.
\"I do not believe that the autonomy of the regulatory body would be affected,\" he recalled, \"and that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the federal executive, who has a constitutional mandate, the State branch.
Replacement of analog digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has suffered in recent years, and translates into better use of radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
To postpone the change, he argued, would be to postpone the benefits of digitization, which implies a decision of public interest, which does not only have a technical dimension, -to cover economic, social, political and national security issues -
These issues, he pointed out, “require the operation of the entire established system, in accordance with the principle of economic governance of the State, encompasses a group of powers that the Constitution leads to the power of the State Executive”
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already concluded the digital transition, and has done so through the Executive, despite highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the executive, in issuing the contested decree, which somehow invades the area of competence of Congress, as it is providing in the administrative sphere the observance of laws issued by the Legislature, has ensured.
Analysis of the possibility of a vote-vote count in Michoacán
According to the data from the PRP, the difference between the first and second place of the governor's election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total minutes.
The possibility of the count - vote by vote - is a reality in relation to the electoral process of this year in Michoacán, where according to the data drawn by the Pre-Trial Electoral Results Programme (PREP) the difference between the first and second place of the governor's election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total minutes.
In this regard, the President of the General Council of the Michoacán Electoral Institute (EMI), María de los Angeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that just a few days ago, just on November 9, the electoral body adopted a series of guidelines in order to harmonize local norms with federal electoral reform.
As will be recalled, Michoacán did not approve its political Constitution or its Electoral Code of the State or its Electoral Justice Act, provided that the Congress of the State approved the reforms shortly before the end of the legal deadline for them to enter into force in the present electoral process and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted its publication within the time limits provided for in the Official State Periodic Act, with the argument that it had some objections.
On 9 November itself, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional dispute promoted by the local Legislative Power and described the vote of the state representative as \"invalid and illegal \" to constitutional reforms, whenever it has no right to \"sanction or veto them \" .
Interviewed about the possibility of voting, Maria de los Ángeles Llanderal explained that thanks to the adoption of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of the IEM it will be possible to make partial and total counts of voting by the local electoral body.
In this way, the partial counting of votes, of one or more electoral packages, may be made on the assumption that: the results of the minutes do not match; there is no record of scrutiny and counting on the file or do not open to the President of the Chamber; or, where there are obvious errors or alterations to the minutes.
In addition, the total count of the vote received in all the ballot boxes may be made where there is evidence that the difference between the alleged candidate winning the election in question and the candidate who obtained the second place in the vote is equal to or less than one percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the meeting there is the express request of the party representative and/or coalition that he postulated the second of the candidates identified.
The total voting can also be made if, at the end of the ordinary accounting period, the difference between the allegedly winning candidate and the second-placed candidate is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that there is the express request of the representative of the political party whose candidate remained second, in which case the electoral packages that have been subject to partial counting will be excluded.
It should be mentioned that in this situation there is the election of Morelia, where according to the PREP the difference between the first and the second place is only 0.16 percent, although not counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total minutes.

Hours before the finding, the military authority presented to the media eleven persons who were detained in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shot dead in different parts of the body and shot with grace, on an abandoned farm in Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León municipality.

The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
The prime minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put that country at the edge of the economic disaster
The Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet on Wednesday with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy at the edge of the economic disaster and has put the whole eurozone at risk.
A communiqué from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet on Wednesday with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that he can form a government.
It is expected to present a cabinet composed mostly of technocrats, although it is not clear when the new executive will take office.
Monti said he will present to the president the outcome of his talks with the political parties in his attempt to form a government.
“I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country’s ability to overcome this difficult phase,” the former European Commissioner told journalists.
Monti did not explicitly say that he could form a government but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles had been overcome.
The mark is now well outlined, he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than normal, while Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has driven its debt costs to unsustainable levels.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must adopt a tough austerity package required by European leaders to regain the hit confidence in Italy.
Underlining the pressure on Monti to hurry, the instability of the markets placed the yield of the Italian bonds BTP at 10 years above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to be rescued.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian employer Confindustria, told the press after meeting with Monti: \"We said we would support this government a lot.\"
We believe that this Government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
Monti's chances of success were greatly driven by the support of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, who was forced to resign on Saturday.
\"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are meant to have a good result,\" said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the center-right party.
The support of the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is significant because so far many of its members have opposed the Government of a technocrat majority that is forming Monti.
Parliamentary support
The new Monti Government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what is likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockade or delay in their efforts could cause a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks joined the pressure by warning that a failure of Monti would be a disaster.
Monti started his consultations on Monday with political parties, trade unions and business groups, as well as with youth and women's organizations.
He'll put an end to his round of meetings on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed Sunday by Napolitano, which has enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief breath at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign, the costs of the Italian debt have now returned to critical levels between uncertainty as to whether the new prime minister will succeed.
To rescue Italy, with a public debt of 1.8 billion euros, would be too much for the eurozone's current financial defences.
Monti has said that his government should last until the next elections, scheduled for 2013, despite the widespread predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms before they advance the elections.
Monti has said that he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that it must be formed only by technicians, an indication of their reparations in the face of a process bound by financial pressure.
Political sources pointed out that mutual distrust and disagreements between parties are making an attempt to include political figures complicated.
The Spanish rock is superior to that of the ticks
Out of the 22 football players called from Spain, ten match the 50 international games.
On the side of Costa Rica only one of the 22 summoned arrived at the 50 meetings.
A capital contrast to that of Costa Rica, if you compare the 22 summoned by both countries for today's friendly, at 3:05 p.m., at the San José National Stadium.
While world and European champions, number one of FIFA's monthly ranquins, account for a wide record of class A interselection games, the Tricolor only owns the defender Michael Umaña as the only one with the 50 international parties.
This figure was reached on the previous Friday in the match against Panama (0-2), at the Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish footballers who play in the League of Stars and in powerful clubs of the Premier League of England maintain an intense activity in league and domestic cup championships, and high-level shocks in European cups such as Champions League.
To the above is added the experience with the Spanish Fury in complicated eliminations of Eurocopa and the World Cup.
Tic footballers, on the contrary, possess a limited international rock in an area, such as the Concaf, which is considered to be the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the maximum registration of the Spanish Selection is of the archer Íker Casillas, who on the previous Saturday before England (fall 0-1 in London) equaled the registration of the exporter Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings.
Houses will play today before the Tricolor and will impose a new record for Spain of 127 internationalities.
Xavi Hernández, Barcelona brain steering wheel, has 106.
Boxes and Xavi, even, were recognized the previous week by UEFA along with the other centenarys of the Iberian team, the mentioned Zubizarreta with 126 and the ariet of the Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
Close to the centenary figure is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
They follow Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61; and David Silva, with 53.
On the tico side, and near Michael Umaña, are the left side Junior Díaz, with 48 presences and the artillery Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five outnumbered the 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain, Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 presences, Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest don't come near 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Victor Bolivar owns only one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson do not yet debut.
The historic enjoyer of Spain is David Villa, with 50 days, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
By Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one that records as many as nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country on its two-decade journey tour
\"Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true\"
In an exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament, of Pearl Jam, said the band is ready to offer one of their best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
They've been waiting for more than 20 years, but the band assures that for them it will also become a reality the dream of playing in the country.
This was ensured by the bassist and founding member, Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively to Viva, from Brazil, last week.
The group is located in the South American wing of its two-decade work tour and on Sunday 20 will make its only scale in Central America.
That day will be presented at the National Stadium, beginning at 7:30 p.m., next to the Angelic Band The X and the Nationals of Las Robertas.
This is an extract of the conversation, whose complete transcript is in The Nation on the Internet.
For his Costa Rican followers, it is a dream come true that Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica, are you aware of what your fans are living in?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is just our second time in South and Central America and so far has been great.
I've been in Costa Rica just once on vacation; it's such a beautiful country and I think we're going to be able to stay there a few days.
So we're thrilled to bring our music there.
I wonder why there is a kind of devotion to the band, fans live with intensity the days before.
What do they tell their most ardent followers?
Thank you for staying at our side through all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to reach Costa Rica; thanks for waiting so long and we regret that it took us so long to get there.
Some people even refer to their concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does that add some pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've played over the last 21 years have happened during the last couple of weeks.
We play a couple of giant shows in Sao Paulo and hope that this has put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we're really looking forward to playing there.
We love that country, we love surfing and jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is among the best in the world.
How did they discover Costa Rica and its surf waves?
We have many friends who are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves there are amazing.
My friends were always going to surf Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along with Mexico, are great places to surf; so it was how we learned, through people who love surfing.
On seeing the tour, they have been delivering huge shows with many songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
As we've never touched there before, then we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to give the best show possible with a good variety of songs; we will try to play a couple of songs from each album and give our fans a good and different repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What's this for?
I think it's partially because we have nine records and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it's hard to choose which songs to play each night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we have been playing for a while, that keeps us focused and also keeps us surprised because it reminds us of the reasons why we liked those songs and that we might have forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it also makes it more interesting for people.
With this tour, they're celebrating 20 years of history.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything they've done?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I think that none of us imagine that we would be in a big rock band and have done it for more than 20 years now that it seems like a dream.
We continue to count our blessings and are very excited that we can continue to make music together.
We all love each other and love to create music.
We're lucky to go to places in the world we've always wanted to go to.
Things couldn't be better for us.
What did it mean for you to have been a fundamental part of the emergence of the grunge?
It has always been an honor to be part of that group of great bands.
We are very friends of the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising when a movement emerges from a group of friends and is somewhat unusual.
From time to time, a city band emerges, but it is much more strange when five or ten bands go out at the same time from the same city.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle Group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on her tour, so we are lucky to be friends with them all still and it honors us to be part of that sound of Seattle that arose.
It is also very strange that a band like yours will remain united and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which, by itself, is much longer than many bands.
First of all, I think we are all fortunate to be still alive and, secondly, we all care about others.
We are all very close friends and, thanks to that, musical avenues have also been opened that give everyone freedom to experience.
We trust each other with each other's music and couldn't be better.
Your relationship with the word fame has not been simple; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do what you want.
How do you find a balance sheet?
As we've been growing, it's been easier to find a balance sheet.
We make sure that you're not too much on tour because it's easy to fall into that game of the great crowds and the people who love your music.
While one remembers that people are there for music, that reminds you that you must respect music and what brought it, without becoming captivating for being famous and being a rock star, something that none of us really care about.
How does your other Mother Love Bone project remind you?
I think we wrote very good songs and at first it was something great.
We were a band for almost three years and never published a record until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There were a lot of frustrations because it lasted so long and the most important thing is that we are still very friends of Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started in the band with us and when I hear a song or see a picture I think of the amazing person Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and much more.
He was an amazing human being and we missed him.
The national band Las Robertas will be responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know your job, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose it for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos with several proposals and that was the band we liked most, so we look forward to seeing what Las Robertas can offer live and must be very entertaining.
Why do Yellow Ledbetter's live lyrics always change?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he does it with the first thing that happens to him.
As a bassist, what are his influences?
That's so many.
Among the first things that happen to me are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many who could talk all afternoon about the bassists I love.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep the grunge relevant despite not being a fashion anymore?
I think we all always feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I mentioned earlier, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all that came up at the same time, and, if there's relevance now, I think it's something wonderful because it's music worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney are doing now better music than ever.
At first, his music had a darker content and has now become more positive.
What is the result of this change?
It's interesting because I think there are a couple of songs on the new album that may seem lighter, but there are also songs, such as The End or Just Breathe that qualify as very dark songs although they may sound a little positive.
With both of them, when Ed touched me, I cried when I heard them and they were deeply dark songs.
I think that when you grow up and have some trauma in your life and you lose a family member or a friend, those things start to influence your art and your music and those two songs, no doubt, represent that to me.
Also, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make music that is dark.
Peru:
Fujimori is hospitalized again for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized on Tuesday in a public hospital to be evaluated for the loss of muscle strength on his legs, his head doctor reported.
Fujimori, 72 years old, who serves a sentence of 25 years in prison for violations of human rights committed during his government (1990-2000), suffers from several diseases, including a cancer in the language for which he has been operated four times and is kept under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal doctor, told the television channel N that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for the pain and loss of strength of its lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate for the benefit of the pardon for humanitarian reasons, however, he said that he does not want it because it is known to be innocent.
It was operated four times of cancer in the tongue, has a weight loss of 18 kg to which other pathologies such as severe erosive gastritis, the cyst of the pancreas, kidney stones, hypertension and circulatory problems in the legs have been gathered, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been in prison since September 2007 in the National Police Special Operations Directorate.
In April 2009 he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people in the hands of an army annihilation squad that operated clandestinely in the early years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official committee, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica, and composed of several ministers and entrepreneurs, will begin a visit to Mexico this Tuesday in order to expand trade between both nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with its Mexican pair, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of an extensive meeting schedule with political, commercial authorities and a meeting with Uruguayan community resident in Mexico, according to the agenda broadcast by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents, in the city of Guadalajara, will be - appropriate for the exchange of information in all political matters between the two nations - as published by the Presidency of the South American country on its website.
According to local media, Mujica would seek to get Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France that arose when the French agent, Nicolas Sarkozy, included the South American country on a list of tax havens, at the meeting of the G20 in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that continue to be tax havens, a statement that provoked the rejection of Uruguay and the call for consultation of its ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has been chairing since November the G20, a group composed of the most powerful emerging and developed countries in the world, and has been in force with the South American country since January this year, an agreement to exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan Government has tried in recent years to speed up the establishment of fiscal exchange agreements in order to move out of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) of countries that did not implement all international tax cooperation standards.
At the commercial level, Mexico and Uruguay have been in force since 2004 a Free Trade Treaty (TLC) which has increased the exchange of goods between both nations.
The bigoted fountain passes the three dimensions with \"Super Mario 3D Land\"
Super Mario has fought, tirelessly, for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the claws of the evil Bowser, but he has never done it in three dimensions so far: in -Super Mario 3D Land - he will fight for the girl's love in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which reaches stores around the world this month, has been designed from the beginning to take advantage of the features of Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without the need to use glasses.
“Mario is the character who has to say how the stereoscopy should work without glasses,” said Nintendo’s specialist press manager in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the video game presentation in Madrid.
Álvarez said that \"Super Mario 3D Land\" is the first Nintendo video game originally intended for that support, since so far successes such as \"Star Fox 64 3D\" or \"Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D\" were adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo spokesperson has argued that, despite being in 3D, Super Mario 3D Land is a video game that allows you to enjoy a quick and fluid match.
Álvarez has stated that \"Super Mario 3D Land\" contains two games in one: the first part is \"simple\" to hook up the less skilled users.
Once overcome, the most experts will be able to make a second turn at the level of play, which this time presents greater difficulty.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an aggressive \"D\" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it will be necessary to play in three dimensions in order to overcome the different challenges and - not succumb to optical illusions -
This Super Mario incursion in the three dimensions also involves the character's return to a portable console, which has not occurred since 2005.
In this video game Nintendo makes guillotines to saga followers and repeats the formula of the success of previous deliveries, consisting that the moustache fountain will have to resort to endangered platforms in order to free Princess Peach.
Although the player will find news in the movements, environments, costumes and enemies as well as a Luigi - playable -
Colom endorses the extradition of Portillo to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced this Tuesday that he proceeded to the extradition of ex-goverrant Alfonso Portillo to answer in the United States for the conspiracy for the washing of $70 million.
This concludes the process for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country that it asked Portillo to judge him there.
At a press conference, Colom stated that his decision was subject to the independence of judicial and executive powers, taking into account that a court of judgment had already ordered extradition.
He claimed that during his term, he did not get his hands on judicial decisions and dealt with all the extraditions he had met.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be extradited for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colom's act is an executive process after all judicial and constitutional bodies have been exhausted to prosecute the ex-mandatory from 2000 to 2004.
According to resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Court of Constitutionality (CC), Portillo must be extradited once it has settled its legal situation in Guatemala and its human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted by the failure of Q120 million in the Ministry of Defence when he was president, which was the process that preceded extradition, but the Public Prosecutor appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was born to prevent the decline in the marginality of untrained boys
The balance of the first 25 years of life of the social support entity Trinijove is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have been helped to overcome a difficult situation throughout this fourth century.
This is added to the 100 long jobs currently achieved for this social group.
The anniversary served yesterday to balance in an event celebrated in the former Fabra i Coats factory complex attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was born in the Trinitat Vella neighborhood in 1986 in order to help young people with little training, without work, with problems of degradation or in a situation of marginality.
The celebration of yesterday in Sant Andreu concentrated on a large number of responsible entities and institutions that have collaborated with the association over 25 years.
The varied political representation, in full electoral time, showed the unitary nature of the work done by Trinijove.
Together with the president of the Generalitat, Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the former socialist education adviser Ernest Maragall and the former mayor and current eco-socialist councillor Richard Gomà attended the event.
They also came to the large hall of the Fabra and Coats, the current councillor of Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the general director of the social work of La Caixa, Jaume Lanspa.
But he said that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that the present one is also, but he added that the work done so far - is a good basis -
The president set up Trinijove as an example for knowing how to fight bad circumstances and for giving hope to people with difficulties.
“The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does,” he said.
Delocated an open farm where macrofiests were made
The invaders had belonged to 11 of the 13 floors of the building, in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants left the farm at noon yesterday without offering resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare the neighbours of the 51st of Balmes Street have come to an end.
Twelve people left yesterday's afternoon voluntarily the property they were illegally occupying, and where they organized macro-fiests who were desperate for the neighborhood, by court order and without the need for a police intervention.
When the operation was completed, the door lock was changed to prevent a repeat of the situation.
“From now on there will be access control,” the administrator said.
The Okupas, which had invaded 11 of the 13 floors of the building - the rest are inhabited - took the entire electrical installation and part of the water, as well as painting the walls and leaving waste of all kinds, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
The first three floors were the stage of the crowds' parties, which lasted for up to two days and were desperate for the tenants.
Next to the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which has also been damaged.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat explained to Europe Press that since the building was occupied the business has dropped by 80%.
The owner of the disco points out that the invaders of the farm gave him unfair competition, as they sold the cups to three euros, while in the disco are worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the place of leisure had had to respond to neighboring complaints for noise, while, he pointed out, the inconveniences did not provoke them by the club’s customers, but by the inhabitants of the house of Okupada and, above all, by the attendees of the parties that were held there, which had increased their frequency and intensity in recent weeks, according to the angry neighbors of the area.
The head of the club explained that the inconveniences were so great that he even came to an agreement with the owner of the property and nine months ago that - sorry - the rent.
The Urban Guard also confirmed that during the past few weeks it had received more complaints from neighbours about the situation.
The president of the municipal PP group at the town hall, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had claimed last week - to immediately dislodge the property to end the problems of coexistence and civicism that produce the neighbours, as well as the degradation of the area -
The popular leader explained that before the summer there was only one plant of the building occupied, but over the past months the okupas had entered all the floors of the building and on almost all floors, and that in some even thefts have occurred.
In this sense, he added, \"it is necessary to end impunity and be blunt against the incivism that has been generated on the farm.\"
Also yesterday, the Mossos dislodged a building in Nou Barris.
At 3.30 p.m., the police headed up to 35 Mont-ral Street, after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed four people accessing the building.
The four were arrested at the time.
Park or mountain?
Architects coincide in the occasion of the call beyond controversy over fees
The municipal competition on the 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the middle of the 80s, in the midst of the already extinct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration printed some Pasquines for the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great park of Barcelona metro.
Moreover, it was accompanied by a comparison, in figures, with the New York Central Park.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park once again settled, in the imagination of many, such as the upper limit of Barcelona, being the Catalan capital of the few that are not oriented in the north-south axis but up (mountain) -down (sea).
Collserola's rating as a natural park is based on this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with the wild boars in the role of Yogi bear.
In these were until, in September, the city council convened a megacompetion composed of 16 competitions for so many other access doors to Collserola.
A door refers to the idea of the park, no doubt.
Either that or someone's trying to put doors in the field.
The question comes out alone: Collserola, park or mountain?
The contest, both because of its purely organizational nature and because of what it means to reflect on the city is the topic of conversation among all the Barcelones architects.
It is almost already a recurring issue to be dealt with when two members of this former caste of elect are recognized in an elevator.
And this fact is precisely one of the few coincidences between what three Barceloneese architects think, and university professors, who have presented themselves.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Mordol and Marta Bayona: the contest is timely.
For Roldán, after addressing the coastal front - it becomes necessary - to discuss the front of the mountain - every time Ildefons Cerdà's speech, that of the green apples, has not been carried out.
It can start from the base that Barcelona's most extensive park is the beach.
Among other things because of its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex - the architect for whom the title of \"Collserola gate\" locks a \"lexic trap\" - must not be thought of - such as access to a park, but the delimitation of areas where action is to be taken -
Modole, such as Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, qualifies the proposal of \"intellectual right\" with (some dangers)
Hazards derived from the \"hazard\" that today is to project the public space - after the experience experienced in the 80s and that it had in the Forum area - its swan song -
The first fear is the very delimitation of borders on where it can be built.
‘Limiting something is fixing the next step already — that is, its overstep.
\"New urban planning tools must be thought of, because the current ones [in reference to the Metropolitan General Plan (MPG)] can give rise to genuine disasters\"
More succinct to the question, Modeol believes that, by simplifying, the Vertient Vallesana de Collserola - it can be understood as a park, that of Barcelona, not - for a purely topographical question.
Modolo recalls that there is already a work done by the Patronat de Collserola that - it must not fall into a broken bag - although it is grateful for the opportunity that the township offers to its branch to intervene in this project - from the first moment -
And even more, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the safe conduct that allows the architects to enter the debate, but - due to - it is this technical profile that must lead the multidisciplinary teams - all right - points out) that they have had to create: -The architects should be just a tool -
Bayona insists that the answer to the question given to this piece is complex, because in the bases of the contest there is no global vision of Collserola: \"16 cross-sectional contests have been called - it says - in the direction of mountain-sea, but there is no longitudinal reading, which sees and understands the area as a whole -
This results, at least in the case of you, in that you have chosen to participate in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, a project for one of the doors can clash in program and definition with that of the architect of the door next door.
In his view, that is the case, the town hall should ensure that the strip immediately superior to the Dalt Round should foresee, in its entirety, an area of equipment that would make a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazabal and will go free
After 72 days of rooting, the legal owner of the Casino Red granted forgiveness to the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey of the process that followed him for alleged blackmails
After staying in custody 72 days, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the legal commander of the Casino Red has granted him forgiveness before the District Criminal Second Judge, who follows a blackmail trial against the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey.
After the attack at Casino Royale, the owner of the Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, released a series of photographs and videos in which Manuel Jonás allegedly demanded the payment of an economic fee for the city council to allow the clandestine operation of the gambling house.
Following the public complaint, the State Prosecutor's Office opened criminal proceedings against the brother of the Panist Mayor and on 2 September he was arrested and held for 30 days.
After four hours before Public Prosecutor 3 in Heritage Crimes, he was transferred to the Root House 1, located in the Old Quarter of the State capital.
In that place, he remained for 49 days after being given a second arrest warrant after the Public Prosecutor's Office had discarded the crimes of rocket and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to Cadereyta's criminal allegedly for blackmailing with a million and a half weights to the owners of the Casino Red; however, he remained only a few hours in the middle-security prison as there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to follow the trial in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On 25 October, he was given a warrant for arrest by the Secretary of the Second District Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who said that almost two months after the investigation, sufficient evidence was found to determine Jonah's guilt, such as the collection of 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the betting house in exchange for allowing the operation of it.
This Monday, the legal commander of Casino Red, Victor Aldo García Gómez, came to Judge José Luis Pecina to ask for forgiveness for the brother of the regional mayor; so in the next few hours he could regain his freedom.
During the legal proceedings, the Public Prosecutor's Officer, Ramiro Arias, questioned García Gómez if the damage had been repaired and who of the betting partners was the one who granted the pardon, although the lawyer tried to reserve the name.
On the basis of file 197/2011, the legal pardon is granted to Jonás Larrazábal and, on the other hand, no claim may be lodged concerning the process that followed him; in addition, he will not be required to be compensated for any damage or punishment.
After the hearing of the legal owner of the gambling house, about 15:50 the immediate freedom of Larrazabal Breton was ordered.
The Secretary of the Juzgado, Jorge Yánez, moved to the prison of San Nicolás de los Garza municipality to notify Jonás that he has been legally forgiven and his file will be archived.
He will also notify you of the immediate order of liberty issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionysio Pérez Jácome gives details of the air accident where the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake, lost his life, and seven more people
The Communications and Transport Secretariat (SCT) reported that the results of the accident in which the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora, and seven others, indicated that the helicopter was directly impacted on the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionysio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before taking off the aircraft, the pilot found that the weather conditions were the right ones to fly.
“The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the ground, the aspas had contact with trees 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage”
He also reported that the unit was designed for 19 people, so it had the necessary requirements to transport staff.
In addition, he said that research in the impact area did not report the appearance of pieces on the ground.
In a search it is reported that there are no parts or components of the ship elsewhere, the impact was presented structurally.
The helicopter was designed for 19 passengers, with suitable requirements for transporting passengers.
The ground has a slope of seven degrees at 30 degrees.
For the time being, the secretary assured that it was a priority to have the results as early as possible; however, research could last several months, even up to one year.
For his part, Gilberto López Meyer, Director-General of Airports and Auxiliary Services, assured that at the time of impact, the helicopter of the Presidential Staff operated at cruise speed and that this happened on a soft terrain uphill.
\"This information strengthens the hypothesis of a normal cruise operation at the time of impact,\" he said.
At the press conference, the TBS holder, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to the aircraft regulations the flight was carried out under the visual flight rules, this implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and the terrain.
Weather conditions:
Reports in the AICM were suitable for take-off, as the aircraft moved towards the border area between the DF and the State of Mexico presented layers of cloud at low altitudes.
Selected paths:
It is likely that by cloud conditions the crew has sought a lower elevation area and increased visibility towards the valley of Cuernavaca.
Impact location.
The impact coordinates and the last record of the radar aircraft coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration in the flight path.
Dispersion of aircraft remains in a reduced area:
The information available so far allows to assume that the impact occurred in a straight and side path.
The aircraft remains scatter pattern suggests that the helicopter was impacted on the ground under conditions of structural integrity.
No evidence of fire or explosion has been detected:
On the site of the sinister there is still no evidence in the remains of the ship of some kind of explosion or fire.
The latest research results indicate that it may have had multiple contact with the ground.
During the field work, parts of the aircraft have been found at an elevation of 9 thousand 200 feet above the average sea level, the ground has a slope ranging from seven degrees to 30 degrees.
The photographs show the sequence in which it was expected to disband along that tour.
The information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts on the ground.
After thorough search in a wider area than the agreed site, around the accident, no scattered parts of the aircraft have been found, thus strengthening the presumption that the impact was presented in structural integrity conditions.
MSS Announces Protocol to Find Obesity Gen
Direct Social Security an investigation to discover the obesity gene in children and young people; it is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute for Social Security (IMSS) announced that it is conducting an investigation to discover the type of obesity in children and young people, called the 'Genetics of Childhood Obesity and Adolescence' protocol, which will allow for overweight associated markers.
In a statement, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry of the Hospital de Specialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was integrated.
This team is supported by specialists and graduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Center for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The research invites the participation of the population whether or not it is right-wing, to visit the IMSS participating sports units in the Mexico Valley, where the tests are carried out on minors, every Saturday from 8:00 a.m.
He stressed that the protocol began in the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (Ponient Mexico State) and that since 8 October, the activity is carried out in the Nezahualcoyolt Sports Unit (East Mexico State).
Once the objective of meeting 500 or 600 minors is met, the study will continue in the Sports Independence Unit (south of the Federal District) and finally in the Morelos Sports Unit (north of the Federal District).
He explained that the purpose of this research is to know the components and importance of genetics with respect to the development of obesity and to identify risk factors in Mexican children and young people to prevent the occurrence of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the 14th of November on the World Diabetes Day, he stated that the goal is to bring together three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years of age, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the implementation of specific food questionnaires.
They will also be asked about the physical activity and heredofamily history of disease, with the aim of avoiding risk factors that trigger such diseases as diabetes or renal failure.
It was detailed that Saturdays are applied to all participants anthropometric measurements (weight, size, waist circumference), blood pressure, glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetics (it is sought to identify genes associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz López pointed out that this research is due to the concern of health professionals for the alarming increase in weight in children.
'Health surveys in 1999 and 2006 reported that in just six years there was an increase in the case of children, 77 per cent in obesity, and girls 47 per cent; in terms of overweight, a dramatic rise was also observed', noted IMSS specialist.
He indicated that the justification for searching for markers is based on the fact that the population of the country differs from others because of its genetic history.
He reported that on average, Mexican has 65 percent of American Indian heritage, 30 percent European and five percent African and this condition is reflected in genes associated with diabetes and excess weight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity translates into the inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calories) that is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit to participants is the comprehensive evaluation of children, which allows to detect if they have any degree of overweight or obesity.
Even, he said, the presence of dark-colored folds (cantosis) in the neck and forearm, which indicate the likelihood of metabolic alterations and even prediabetes.
The information is handled confidentially, the doctors hand it in writing to the parents, who are explained by each of the measurements and changes in the lifestyle that they must make in order to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic ailments: sedentaryness, which is the lack of daily physical activity, stay for the most part of the day sitting in front of the TV and use means of transportation instead of walking short distances.
It is also due to high caloric intake, i.e. higher consumption of sugary drinks, carbohydrates (tamals, bread, pizza, hamburger, etc.) with high fat and protein content and the genetics analyzed in this protocol.
UNAM asphalt would avoid slums
Rafael Herrera, a researcher at the UNAM Faculty of Chemistry, develops asphalts modified with polymers to produce a mix with better performance, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signs sent by the pavement were met, it would not be necessary to repair nearly 200 thousand basins each rainy season in the Metropolitan Zone of the Valley of Mexico, he warned Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of UNAM, who assured that if the process of building and maintaining an asphalt floor is appropriate, the basins could be reduced in quantity or even eliminated completely.
In his lecture A technological opinion of the basins, dictated in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, revealed that the laboratory in charge develops asphalts modified with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of the asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, at both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera estimated that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, like some cities in the north of the country, to improve its performance and thus the formation of basins.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, some of high molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and others of low molecular weight, called maltenes, which together give the floor its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of the asphalt consists of that at high temperatures, about 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees centigrade its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees centigrade it has an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes broken, it added.
The above means that in the streets asphalt resistance is not uniform, but is being modified during the day according to environmental and temperature conditions, the specialist in chemical engineering warned.
The FQ researcher observed that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered by flexible pavement, which consists of six layers of materials, of which the last three involve the asphalt.
Among the most superficial layers is the asphalt folder, made up of small stones bathed in asphalt and then compacted.
Each of the stones that constitutes the folder, he pointed out, is bathed with asphalt.
By transiting vehicles and making efforts, it allows the forces to spread very well on the pavement.
If it was a modified asphalt, it would spread even better, the chemical engineer said.
On the asphalt folder, it abounded, one last layer is placed called the rolling folder, which is made of a fine stone material, i.e. an arena that also bathes in asphalt.
As this is the layer that will be in contact with the wheels of the vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt folder and provide friction on the way.
Being the part of the floor that will receive and disseminate the efforts, the treadmill also requires the appropriate thickness and the material of what is made must be taken care of.
The climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, is also a very important factor to consider, especially water, said, because it significantly affects the performance of the asphalt folder.
When the ground is moistened, the water is spread inside the folder and it is difficult to leave, this causes a reblazing of all layers of the floor and thus the formation of basins.
In the process of forming a basin, he said, the first to wear out is the rolling film and only then the asphalt folder is affected, but the damage does not occur instantly, but it is a process that should be attended to the first signals with adequate maintenance programs.
The member of the National Investigators System also explained that the vehicle load is another important factor in the formation of basins and, therefore, the thickness of each of the layers of the floor should always be related to the vehicle load and ensure that it is met, to avoid the formation of basins frequently.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, asphalt emulsions, which in other countries are already in the market and allow to repair the basins easily and without the need to use high temperatures.
What did the Valle candidate miss to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that prompted Melina Ramírez Serna not to reach the crown of Miss Colombia.
The Valley receives its title number 14 as a princess.
Again the Valle del Cauca remains with the desire of the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to make up for being at the winning podium, polishing the silver crown and band that believed her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where the Atlantic lady stood up with the crown and the scepter, the department already adds 14 titles of Princess and Melina joins the legion of Vallecaucana women who have been near the crown but who were proclaimed princesses among them Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Monica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcès Aljure (2008).
Today the big question that many ask is what is missing?
Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite that in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, not in vain was elected Queen of the Police and Best Rotro Jolie de Vogue, titles that obtained queens such as Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that is considered key in the decision that the jury made to designate her First Princess is that she did not agree with her answer to the question: What is that book that marked you and why? made by Martin Murillo Gómez, of the Literary Cart Leamos.
The Vallecaucana replied to the question:
“I read a lot, I believe a lot in literature, I think it’s a way to culturalize, I definitely think that the book that marked me as a child is “The Beginner” is a rather profound book.
Today I am reading the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian book, a beautiful book called \"The Burn of Blood.\"
A response that did not like the term first - to be cultured - and second not to explain in a concrete way how each of the books quoted it have marked it.
But at the end of the Melina ceremony he expressed himself feeling calm and happy with the result - the universe is wise past what has to happen.
And for all people, please read a little, \"The Beginner\" is a great book.
Among the hypotheses launched, it is said that Valle burned her favoriteism.
A Bogotan journalist suggested that, in being the favorite, the ovated and the candidate who took all the preliminary awards (Rite of Oster gastronomy, vote of the public for the best craftswear, and Queen Mother), -it aroused the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and therefore did not shine on the stage -
And that was noticed in his first performance in a swimsuit on the Hilton beach and his two parades on the coronation evening.
Although both fought safely, it was noted that he lacked the strength and momentum shown by the representatives of Magdalena and the Atlantic.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the RCN Channel’s “How at Home” program, said that Melina’s appointment as a princess “checks that the candidate who wins the most prizes during the competition is not queen”
In addition, Valle showed herself to the last very sloppy with the press, and there she was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury about its interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
For one thing, two days before the election, the international jury Lucy Doughty stated that they were looking for a woman committed to the social needs of their parents.
“The beauty alone is not enough in a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond the physical and focus on its social sensitivity, which before entering the Contest are already involved in projects,” he explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned for her defects in the back and the fibrosis that was noticed in her abdomen, but it is contradictory because precisely the jury chose her as the candidate 'Natural Beauty' with the healthier body, good food and responsible physical work.
Queen preparer Jorge Hernán Orozco acknowledges that Melina did not have the best body, which had the best, but her problem with fibrosis in the abdomen, that the truth to me was not very well known, lowered points on the last day -
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos, of the magazine Cromos considers that the mistake of the vallecaucana was the surgical interventions that were practiced.
The surgeries are good, but Valle wasn't able to do them.
His body was never his strong and here he was charged -
For this award, which for the first time delivered the National Beauty Competition, after the parade in the swimsuit came up a cruel Vatican that was fulfilled last night, as it was said that this was the content that Raymundo gave Melina not to give her the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, it is true that Melina has since begun a year of reign, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, a position that gives her the possibility to represent Colombia in one of the international citations by designation of the National Competition itself.
However, she will pass on to history as one of the queens who, despite her towering passage through Cartagena, was removed from her crown.
This was the work of the horn that identified Alfonso Cano's corpse
A lymphoscopeist from Cali went on to history as the man who confirmed the death of \"Alfonso Cano\"
The work of these staff members is key.
On November 4 a lofoscopicist of the CTI of Cali passed to history as the man who confirmed the identity of the chief of the Farc: \"Alfonso Cano\" through the quote of his fingerprints.
Of the seven lofoscopicists working in the ITC sectional, this week he was playing the “availability” shift to Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in the area of judicial investigation for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in Chocó municipalities, where he often had to stay in the jungle for more than five days to reach the place where the corpses were to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to the capital of the Valley and, after the corresponding courses, specialized in lophoscopy, which is the study of friction skin, that is, palms of the hands and feet.
The week of operation against alias Alfonso Cano to Eliazar was warned to wear minimum clothing for three days.
Something big was waiting for him.
On Friday night he left for the Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew that he should identify two corpses and that one of them was suspected of being the man who was heading for the world's oldest guerrilla, so they asked him to carry Guillermo León Sáenz's decactile card (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the investigation team at the site where the corpse was located he did not recognize it because of its physical appearance, it was very different from what he had seen in the media.
He was beardless, dressed like a peasant in the area, without glasses and much thinner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Accompanied by a galtonian magnifying glass, ink, transplanter, and flashlight, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the body with those of the card.
His eye didn't fail him: it was \"Alfonso Cano\"
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was in charge of confirming to the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that it was the chief of the Farc.
Searching for the fingerprint
For a hitchhiker from Sijín de Cali the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos made to Eliazar González, on the press wheel for the operation against -Cano - is very significant.
Many people don't know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an accurate science, without margin of error, that can become key in the resolution of crimes.
Apart from the identification of corpses, the lofoscopics support investigations into crimes such as stealing and murder and confirm the identity of the captured persons.
When captured, many criminals present false ballots or have no papers.
We take the fingerprint and look them up in the database.
The investigator reported that in a case of theft, he was touched to remove a piece of wall from a house, because in that place the thief had supported his hand to remove a safe full of jewelry and money.
The walls are difficult because they are not appropriate surfaces to get a fingerprint, but in that case we were able to get the mark from the whole hand and identify the offender, who had participated in different thefts, he remembered.
The fingerprints can also rule out or reaffirm suspects in cases of homicide.
Recently they found a dead man, with bottles of liquor around him.
Through the investigation it was determined that a family member could be suspected of the crime and, indeed, a mark in the bottle coincided.
Although this does not guarantee that it was the killer, it does locate him at the crime scene.
One CTI dactyloscopeist explained that in the objects - the prints are removed with chemical or physical reagents -
When they appear, a transplanter or tape is used to lift them.
After this, the impressions are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the Registry.
“The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians,” the expert from the ITC said.
He clarified that not everything is as shown in the CSI television program.
Just as not all that shines is gold, not all that is touched becomes a footprint.
However, if it can be used, if the respective knife is made.
The “indignados” challenge the authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters flocked to Zuccotti Square to camp.
A large part met the eviction order and moved to a nearby paruqe.
The members of the Occupy Wall Street movement challenged the New York authorities this Tuesday in an attempt to re-enter, under a court order, the Manhattan Square from which they were dispossessed in the early morning and trying to occupy another park of the Great Manzana.
Hundreds of protesters flocked to Zuccotti Square, where they wanted access thanks to a court order that allowed the (indignados) to camp again in the place, while another part of the movement responded to the eviction by occupying a park further north of the city, where there were new arrests.
\"Our idea is that, if the court doesn't allow us to camp in the square again, we'll settle somewhere else and continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, as well as through peaceful sit-ups and demonstrations,\" said one of the spokespersons of the movement - Occupa Wall Street - Mark Bray.
Bray detailed that the response of the \"indignados\" to the eviction of his camp by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, came to the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order banning forced evacuation of the place and allowed protesters to stay camped.
In addition, the \"indignados\" proceeded to occupy a new park located at the confluence of the central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which unites New York and New Jersey, and owned by the parish of Trinity Church.
At least for an hour they managed to take the place, but then the police came and proceeded to arrest some of the protesters, although Bray was unable to confirm the concrete figure, while he assured Efe that he saw several journalists who were also handcuffed.
The organization assures that there are several hundred people who had settled at that point, where a delegation of religious leaders has already been displaced in evidence of support for the members of the movement and has tried to mediate with the police.
Meanwhile, the Zuccotti Square, which is a private property, is still closed pending the holding of a judicial hearing scheduled for this very Tuesday in which the legality of the evacuation of this morning must be analysed.
Some of the demonstrators displaced so far carried and distributed copies of that court order at this hour and even handed them over to the agents guarding the plaza, which led to some small clashes, said Bray, who reported that some officers had beaten the protesters.
The court order prohibits authorities from dislodging members of Occupy Wall Street or applying - laws that were published after the occupation began or prohibiting protesters from again accessing the park with shops or other properties they used previously -
Mayor Bloomberg pointed out to the press that, because of that court order, the city had suspended the reopening of space to the public and protesters, to whom he warned, however, that local laws do not allow them to re-install with tents and sleeping bags.
The director personally defended the eviction of Zuccotti Square in the early morning, an operation in which about 200 arrests were carried out and which was decided because the protesters were - violating the law -
Bloomberg explained that he ordered that the plaza be evacuated because it was becoming a place where people were not coming to protest, but to violate laws and, in some cases, to harm other people - since - some businesses had received threats - and the neighbors feared - for their quality of life -
\"The eviction of this morning was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is more interested in preserving the financial interests than those of American workers,\" added the spokesman of the movement, who accused the mayor of \"lacking respect for freedom of expression\"
The leaders of “Ocupa Wall Street” also indicated that they are planning to organize “great actions” for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and trade unions to commemorate the two months of the protests, which began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary on a special television Christmas
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian seniors, it will appear in the television show - It's to Russell Peters Christmas - next December 1st
The Canadian Pamela Anderson has been Tim Allen's assistant at Home Improvement, a supporter of \"Baywatch\" with \"Playboy\" the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a Christmas special of Canadian television.
The CTV's private television channel today announced that Anderson, along with the \"crooner\" (baladist) Michael Bublé and other Canadian tops, will appear in the television program \"It's to Russell Peters Christmas\" on December 1 giving life to a very particular Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images of the television program in which Anderson, also known for the wide internet distribution of a pornographic home video in which he appears along with his then husband, the battery of \"Mötley Crüe - Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary holding in a manger a doll representing Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comic from Indian origin who recently acted as a presenter in part of the tour \"My Violent Torpedo of Truth\" by Charlie Sheen, appears as José.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, CTV's special Christmas girl has Canadian singer Bublé, who married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, and who is no stranger to the controversy.
Recently, Bublé called the American Kim Kardashian during one of her concerts in New York City.
Japan is born after the earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the fall spiral that started in March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, still appalling by the devastating earthquake that has become a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster the Japanese country has had since World War II.
The first estimates by the Government of Tokyo contained material losses of $30 billion, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, seems to have mitigated.
After three consecutive quarters of falls, the data of Gross Domestic Product between July and September served to pass page, definitely: GDP increased 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% at annualized rate.
The registration in the second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also represents the highest rate of growth from January to March 2010.
The recovery is explained, in part, by the repulsion of the purchase of machinery to restore the areas ravaged by seism and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1 per cent, compared to the fall of 0.9 per cent in capital expenditures observed from January to March, the first setback after six months of uninterrupted climbs.
However, the real resultive of the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian drive that invites us to take advantage of the crises to reinforce - or rebuild - infrastructures, use the shortcomings to grow from scratch.
Japan has, above all, been awakened by the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60 per cent of Japanese GDP.
This variable escalated by 1%, pushed by increased spending on vehicles, travels and leisure activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has been entrusted to the internal market, when the yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the \"refuge values\" chosen by investors who escape the debt crisis in the euro area and the turbulent forecasts of the US, a privilege that weighs like a loss on the accounts of the exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic buoyancy line is determined by the health of major technological groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, found their weak results between July and September at the rate of the yen.
As the markets continue their siege of the peripheral countries of the EU, the Yoshihiko Noda Government does not lower the guard.
\"We must pay attention to the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen,\" said the Secretary of State for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa yesterday.
And, indeed, prospects are not encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) specified that most member countries presented in September more clear signs of economic slowdown.
The indicator that anticipates the inflection points in the world economy has highlighted that the main powers are slowing down.
Since it dropped four tenths to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 August.
The euro area, even, was below the average, which is at level 100, by precipitating eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens once again fuels doubts
Papadimos says adjustments will be approved, but conservatives will not sign any written commitments
With the peripheral risk premiums fired and the uncertainty reinstalled in the parks, Greece continues to be entangled in the labyrinth leading to the exit of the major European debt crisis.
The feeling that the 'consensus' of the new Hellenic Transitional Government is more imposed by the demands of Brussels than by genuine conviction of the political forces begins to be confirmed with facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the 100-day period agreed upon in his appointment may be short to implement them, the leader of the Conservative New Democracy Party, Antonis Samaras, assured that he will not support any further austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections by the scheduled date, on 19 February.
\"The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the summit on 26 October,\" Papadimos said in opening a parliamentary debate yesterday, which will culminate in tomorrow with a vote of confidence for the new executive.
A package with 24 programmes to promote employment, reform of the disciplinary code of officials and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras' message leaves no doubt as to his position: \"We have committed ourselves to helping the transitional government, but we have not committed ourselves to anything else.\"
The conservative leader was a further step in his pulse to the EU and the IMF, the agencies that need to unlock the 8,000 million that Athens urgently needs, and made clear that he will not give his good approval to any letter of commitment to comply with the adjustments.
However, the European Commission, which was still aware of the impact of the Papandreu referendum, reiterated yesterday that its requirement is firm: it will not unlock the aid if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties do not sign - a written commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible -
The spokesperson for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the troika inspectors will, very soon, return to Athens to discuss with the new government - what is needed to pay the sixth stage - of 8,000 million, although there is no final date.
The Greek madeja still has a thread for a while.
Doña Sofia: \"They are instruments for progress and hope\"
The Queen highlights Spain’s place - chief - in relation to this type of finance
Spain - has reached a leading place at the world level in the role of Microfinance -
Queen Doña Sofia recalled yesterday that the country has become the second donor to this instrument of cooperation in the last two decades, whose \"existence\" pointed out that it is a tool for social progress, justice and the hope of a better future for all mankind, based on trust in the human being.
Yesterday, the Queen inaugurated the 5th World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid, convinced that - there is no doubt - that operations are - absolutely essential - in order to achieve the United Nations Millennium Goals with a 2015 horizon, and, most notably, in those whose goal is to reduce to half the volume of people living with income below a daily dollar, with which the poverty threshold is fixed -
Spain - continues to work - to expand the network of beneficiaries - to all corners of the planet, and takes up this task with -responsibility - said Doña Sofia, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions that originate at the Summit, which will last until Thursday, - guarantee the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest, and especially for women - would be the main beneficiaries of these loans.
There are a lot of achievements, and many of the challenges we face.
The Microcredit Summit presents itself not only as a forum for debate, but also as the platform from which to promote two basic goals.
Thus, Her Majesty explained that it is hoped that at the end of 2015 it would be 175 million poor families who have access to these financial services and that one hundred million of those households will leave the poverty line at which they are gone.
The momentum in the conception of microcredit in Spain and the rest of the world - followed the path started years ago as a pioneer - by Muhammad Yunus, noted Doña Sofia as an - act of justice and due recognition -
And it is that he described the father of this tool as an admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty, whose work he has known for 15 years, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to learn about her lending policy on the ground.
This experience was followed one year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada 2006, and - in all I have been able to observe the continuous evolution - explained Her Majesty, whose link with this project yesterday was worth the qualification of the family head - congregated in Valladolid by the -baquero of the poor -
Finally, Queen Sophia concluded her intervention by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
\"Ethical imperative\"
The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that solidarity - it is an ethical imperative - for every democratic state.
In this regard, he stated that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic goodwill, as it is a permanent obligation.
Jiménez considered that microcredit is a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to eradicating poverty, and now, more than ever, the governments of developed countries must work under criteria of solidarity and not let it be the victim of cuts.
For Spain, microcredit consists of — one of the main lines of development cooperation —
For its part, the Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, applauded - the success - of giving - confidence - to the people - excluded from those who all close the doors - and the Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present to a city that -with its doors contaged with the spirit of solidarity -
The CDU proposes to elect the European President for universal suffrage
On the first day of the Congress of the Christian-Democratic Union (CDU), on Monday, 14 November, in Leipzig, she has gone through no great difficulties for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and President of the Christian-Democrat Party.
Initially, the future of Europe had not been included on the agenda, but the issue was imposed in autumn, in particular in order to satisfy the militants who believe that the government's policy is currently too strict with the Greeks and could be in the future with the Italians.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the Directorate, was adopted practically unanimously.
Of the 1,001 delegates, only nine votes were recorded and ten abstentions.
The several-minute standing ovation that won, with its interventions, Angela Merkel and, after several hours, Wolfgang Schäuble, the europhilus Minister of Finance, dismiss any possible doubts.
The key idea of the Chancellor, and of the motion, is summed up in a slogan: the response to the crisis - it is not less Europe, but more Europe -
Not only because Europe represents peace, but also because — nine million jobs depend directly on the euro —
For the Chancellor, the time has come to open the way in Europe.
This could be manifested in changes to the Treaty of Lisbon to enable the European Union to monitor the budgetary policies of the countries of the euro area, although it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission for universal suffrage to face Europe.
In any case, that is one of the motions adopted by Congress, clearly the idea of Wolfgang Schäuble.
Without a doubt, it is unlikely that the twenty-seven will quickly reach an agreement on this radical change: Britain is hostile to it and the leaders of the CDU seem to know that Nicolas Sarkozy too.
But the ball is on the ground.
On the other hand, delegates have rejected by a overwhelming majority the proposal to weigh the weight of each country of the European Central Bank directive on the weight of each economy, which would obviously reinforce Germany's weight.
Looking forward to calming the moods within its party, the Chancellor has increased the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. But he has not tried to win his congress at the expense of the \"small\" European countries or countries in difficulty willing to criticize the arrogant Germany.
Although the motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of - Franco-German friendship - Angela Merkel has not lied to France.
Except for the past.
Remembering that, two centuries ago, there was a bloody battle in Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats for Napoleon's army.
The incidence of disease-related fraud
Following the subsidies, both the UMP and the Government undertake an offensive against sick leave.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be on Tuesday 15 November in Bordeaux to visit a box responsible for family allowances and to give a speech on the subject, already recurring since 2007 in the fight against social fraud and aid.
In addition, to accompany such an offensive, which is part of the willingness to save rigorously, but still recalls an axis of the presidential campaign of right-wings, most want to focus on falls by illness.
Firstly, to implement budget cuts: the Government plans to impose on private sector workers a fourth day of shortage before it can be taken down.
In short, unless there is a specific business agreement, a worker who falls sick would lose four days of salary, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly income.
This is a measure that could lift a wave of anger, but which would save 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
In addition, it would be accompanied by another measure with a more symbolic scope: to impose on officials a day of unpaid leave in the event of low employment (so far, they have no shortage, compared to the three days that apply in the private sector).
As these issues are being discussed, the majority of them also put the issue of fraud on the table, this time geared towards the abuses of low-labour jobs.
\"The controls will be greatly increased and, moreover, if someone is discovered committing a fraud, he will have to reimburse the amounts,\" said Xavier Bertrand speaking at the RTL on Sunday 13 November.
As in other cases, the effects of the announcement appear to be slightly disproportionate to the reality of low-labour fraud.
In fact, since 2002, there has been a steady follow-up to this issue and various political offensives have been launched that have usually been successful.
The French are no worse than in the rest of Europe.
Let us pay attention, first of all, to national figures.
According to the French Institute for Social Security (CNAM), over €237 million was paid in 2006 for low-labour benefits.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in the Health Economy, low-income subsidies accounted for 5 per cent of health expenditure in 2008, rising to 11.3 billion euros.
Of this amount, 46% corresponds to maternity and occupational accidents, while 54% is related to sick leave, which amounts to EUR 6.2 billion.
Consequently, 2.5% of expenditure on health care.
In 2010, the French took an average of 14.5 days of low work, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
An average that no doubt hides deviations: another survey, published in 2007 by the professional management Syrian Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed claimed that they had not caught a single day of sick leave.
Another study, in this case of Sick Assurance, indicates that in 2010 37 per cent of sick leave was less than 8 days, 22 per cent between 8 and 14 days, 15 per cent between 15 days and one month, 15 per cent between one and three months and 11 per cent were longer.
If we compare them with our European neighbours, French workers are not more likely than in other areas to catch falls by illness.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers indicated that, between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence of work (both for health and other reasons) ranged from 10 to 11 per cent in France, compared to 20 per cent and 28 per cent in Denmark, 15 per cent in the United Kingdom or between 16 and 18 per cent in the Netherlands.
Fraud on sick leave is not particularly significant compared to undeclared work.
Fraud has a fairly limited scope.
The strengthening of legislation, since 2002, has resulted in the systematic control of falls by disease of more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million inspections, CNAM found, in 13% of the 285,000, that short-term casualties were -unjustified or too long - 37,050 cases.
In the case of falls of more than 45 days, subject to systematic inspections, it was considered that 11 per cent of the cases were - properly adapted or unjustified - a figure which, with a total of 1.2 million starting, amounts to 132,000.
Consequently, a total of 169,000 unwarranted cases are reached among several million workers who have taken a sick leave.
Undoubtedly, a small figure compared, for example, to black work.
According to the MPU Dominique Tian, the author of a report on this issue in June, this practice would represent losses of tax revenues of between 9,000 and 15,000 million euros a year, i.e. more than the total cost of subsidies for casualties and, no doubt, considerably more than fraud in the latter area.
Papadémos: Greece will have to implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment plan to address its economy.
This is what Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos declared on Monday, 14 November, before Parliament; he also added that the hundred days that had been granted to his Government of union would not be enough to achieve that objective.
In order to make efforts to recover the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme, said the Head of Government, who delivered his first public address during the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions adopted at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October will be the \"principal task\" of the new government, since - it is at stake - the country's permanence in the euro area, he added.
As a result, Papadémos has predicted that the country's public deficit will be reduced to about 9 per cent of GDP by the end of the year, after reaching 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right rejects new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the head of the right-wing group, showed on Monday his support for the measures already adopted to try to get out of the debt crisis, but he has warned that his party will not engage with additional austerity measures.
\"We will not vote for new measures,\" he said during a meeting with his party's deputies - New Democracy -
He noted that he agreed with the deficit and debt reduction objectives, as well as the fight against the overthrow, but against any policy that impedes economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the loan of EUR 8 billion needed without a written guarantee of the support of all parties to the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his word would be sufficient and that it would not sign anything because of external pressure.
An expert committee states that euthanasia and assisted suicide should be legalized
Canadians live denying death, as reported by the Royal Society of Canada
In the area of palliative care, the committee claims that Governments, health care institutions and doctors work together to ensure the best palliative care, and not only in cancer cases.
Canadian society lives denying death.
In fact, only 9 per cent of Canadians are willing to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make arrangements to do so.
This is one of the conclusions of an imposing report by the Royal Society of Canada, which included the participation of six experts from various fields, including ethics, legal and medical.
This committee recommends that the Government amend the Criminal Code in such a way as to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, when the patient raises such an option and has been judged competent to take the decision.
To begin with, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit that compared quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada holds the tenth position, the study points out that - the medicalization of death in Canada has generated a culture in which people are afraid to deal with the issue of death -
With or without medication, 77 per cent of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, as indicated by the experts selected by the Royal Society of Canada.
And, despite the fact that most Canadians want to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying in the hospital.
Overall, the highest rate in this respect is recorded in Quebec, where 86 per cent of deaths occur in the hospital.
With regard to the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report reached conclusions that did not coincide with the position of the federal government, which has already stated that they do not wish to amend the Criminal Code in relation to euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to the experts, who have also studied the situation in all countries where such practices have been legalized or do not constitute a criminal offence, there is no evidence that the fact that they are not considered a criminal offence has not led to abuse of their application, i.e., the use of euthanasia or assisted suicide with persons who are not competent or who have not given their consent.
Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, said yesterday by teleconference that, on the contrary, more excesses were observed in those countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide have not been legalized.
\"In Canada, euthanasia is practised, although it is clearly illegal.\"
“In Canada, assisted suicide is practised, although clearly illegal,” Jocelyn Downie explains.
Canadians, in favor of euthanasia
Let us remember that 85% of Canadians have already spoken in favor of euthanasia, as they think it would allow people whose death is near to alleviate their suffering, as indicated by a 2010 survey of Angus Reid.
In addition, 66% believe that the legalization of euthanasia will not imply that the lives of elderly or disabled people are less valuable.
As for those who have committed assisted suicide, 41 per cent of respondents believe that a process should not be initiated against them.
With regard to the maintenance or interruption of health care for a patient, the situation is not as clear as the authors of the report indicate.
In addition, its recommendations suggest that it is indicated in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of health care, if legally rejected, does not constitute a criminal offence.
The expert committee also requests that health professionals be trained in the duty to respect the fact that a patient rejects assistance at the end of his or her life without fear of facing a complaint.
In the area of palliative care, the committee claims that Governments, health care institutions and doctors work together to ensure the best palliative care, and not only in cancer cases.
Finally, in relation to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in the health institutions of Canada, the committee requests that, unless it serves to reduce physical pain, be considered euthanasia and subject to the same procedures.
Other experts express reservations
Other experts in the field of health law have already expressed their reservations in connection with the findings of the report of the experts of the Royal Society of Canada.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has described the “extreme” position of the experts who sign the report, among other things, because euthanasia is not limited to the terminally ill.
“This leaves the door open to a situation where someone who is tired of living and is over 18 can ask for help in suicide,” says Deschamps, who consulted yesterday a summary of the report.
Mr Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report seem to give priority to personal autonomy over any other value of society.
However, he adds that, in society, there are labels and limitations.
Health Law Specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed her strong opposition to the conclusions of the report, which he described as \"humanizing for euthanasia\"
Margaret Somerville, who is also a member of the Royal Society of Canada, puts into question the lack of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
Jordan's King urges President El Asad to leave power
Damascus denounces a “compound”
Syria is becoming more and more isolated
Bachar El Asad partisans demonstrated yesterday before the building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressure on the Syria of Bachar El Asad was intensified, which, with Russia's support, resists and denounces the existence of a \"compilation\" against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union has reinforced the sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, neighbouring Syria, have expressed their support for the abandonment of power by President Asad.
Jordan's King Abdalá II was yesterday the first Arab leader who asked President Bachar El Asad to - leave power - in Syria, where a quarter of civilians and members of the forces of the regime have already died.
\"If Bachar really cares about his country, he should resign, in addition to creating the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life,\" said the king of Jordan, a neighbouring country in Syria, in an interview for the BBC.
For its part, the head of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, has regretted that the mediation efforts carried out by Turkey since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have ended in failure.
\"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will leave,\" he said, referring to Syria, a neighbouring country with which Turkey is adopting an increasingly harsh stance.
For its part, following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union, the United States has concluded that the consensus against Asad and the actions of the Syrian regime has been strengthened.
\"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and other countries, such as Turkey, are taking an ever-harder tone\" with respect to repression in Syria, says Mark Toner, spokesman for the State Department.
In the meantime, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime's forces in the Deraa region in southern Syria have already lost their lives, as announced by the Syrian Human Rights Observatory (OSDH).
Two other civilians have died during bombings and gunfights with heavy machine guns in Jobar in the besieged city of Homs, as indicated by the NGO.
During a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Al Mualem took the view that the country was moving towards the end of the crisis.
In addition, it has strongly reacted to the Arab League ' s decision to suspend Damasco from its functions, which in its view constitutes a dangerous step.
Syria - it will not flash - it added, ensuring that - the plots plotted against Syria will fail -
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently studying a \"civil protection mechanism\" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
The French Foreign Minister, Alain Juppé, has also expressed his support for sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime which, in his view, is confined to the “paranoia”
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled to take place tomorrow in Rabat to finalize the implementation of the crisis exit plan adopted on 2 November, including the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities in the hands of the opposition and the release of the detained demonstrators.
The Russian Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, has judged the Arab League's decision yesterday, while China urged Syria to implement the exit plan, although it did not express its support for the implementation of possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti takes time for markets and sacrifices to Italians
The future head of the Italian Government, Mario Monti, has requested some time for the markets to form their equipment and to launch a programme that will include, \"sacrifices\" aimed at regaining lost credibility during the last few months of the Berlusconi Government.
The former European Commissioner discussed yesterday with political parties and today met with trade unions and employers.
It should form a relatively restricted cabinet composed of technocrats outside Parliament.
“Monti has spoken of a broad programme with numerous sacrifices,” said Francesco Nucara, Member of one of the many small parliamentary groups who participated in the meetings, after meeting with the President of the Council appointed.
For his part, the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, has stated that he hopes that Mario Monti will request a vote of confidence in Parliament by Friday to ensure that the new Government has sufficient support.
The consultations will end with the presentation by Mr Monti of a limited list, no doubt of a dozen ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Monti has commented on the nervousness of the markets and bonders yesterday, asking them for time.
In the \"democracy, there are precise deadlines\" to form a government and prepare its programme, he stressed, adding that he is - I am sure the markets will be patient and will understand -
His appointment by the President initially gained the approval of the markets, but then the concern arose, particularly after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The Prime Minister appointed should create a team primarily made up of technocrats, even if he has stressed that he would like to include \"politicals\"
The new Government will have to function until 2013, the date of the forthcoming legislation, it considers.
According to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new Government will get the vote of confidence from Parliament before Friday.
Monti is committed to working on the matter, taking into account the urgency and the aim of Italy - to regain its prominence - in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn pointed out that, even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy will not vary.
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its objective of achieving a budgetary balance in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted over the past few months, has called for further rigorous measures.
The Italian head Emma Marcegaglia, who will see her mattes, also insisted on the need to boost the economy, because a country that does not grow cannot meet the deficit requirements.
Monti, famous for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), is a \"change of time\" for Italy after 17 years of \"berlusconism\" the \"teacher\" symbolizes \"the challenge of seriousness\" and \"another Italy\" according to editorialists.
The great incognite will be the longevity of your team.
President Napolitano wants to avoid early elections, since Italy has to place some EUR 200,000 million in State bonds before April 2012.
A Russian scientist has collaborated with the Iranian nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has collaborated with Iran in the development of a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, as stated on Monday an American NGO specializing in atomic risk.
For the identification of the researcher, the Institute for International Science and Security (ISIS) is based on a recent report from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents issued by that UN agency.
The IAEA expressed its \"serious concern\" last week for a \"possible military dimension\" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to ISIS, based extensively on IAEA documents, Danilenko, born in 1934, had worked for three decades, since the 1960s, at a Soviet military nuclear centre in Tcheliabinsk (Ural) and would have participated in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the centre to form a company focused on the production of -nanodiamonds - in Kiev.
His company's economic problems would have brought him into contact with the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Later, it is believed that it cooperated with the Iranian programme between 1996 and 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its last report, the IAEA mentions that there are - clear indications that Iran is developing - a nuclear detonation system - with the help of a foreign expert, who not only knew the technique, but also, as a Member State has informed the Agency, worked during most of its career in that technology in the military programme of its country of origin -
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by 50 per cent
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by about 50 per cent between 2009 and 2010, while during the same period, the remaining types of racial and religious violence have decreased or increased only slightly, as reported by the FBI on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of acts of violence against Muslims has increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. it has increased by 49 per cent, compared with a rise of 13 per cent in the case of acts of violence against Catholics, a 4 per cent reduction in crimes against Jews and a 14 per cent increase in the number of crimes and anti-religious offences.
The total number of - hate crimes - has grown slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% is due to racial differences and 20% to religious differences, as the FBI indicates.
“After a decline in 2009, it is worrying that these types of crimes and crimes have increased again,” highlighted the human rights organization Human Rights First, “the increase in violence against Muslims is particularly significant,” the organization added in a statement.
“Human Rights First has long pointed out that violence against Muslims, as well as all types of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights,” adds one official of the organization, Paul Legendre.
\"The U.S. Government can and should strive to end such abuses,\" he adds, considering that such efforts could include an improvement in police reports on \"hate crimes\"
The “crime of hatred” in U.S. federal law was inherited from the time of the struggle for civil rights.
Such legislation was adopted following the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence linked to race, skin color, religion, origin and, now, sexual inclination.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The Twitter microblogging site modified on Monday the presentation of its platform to allow its users, in particular, to observe the activity of the people they follow, which causes their service to look a little more like Facebook.
A new tab - activity - and another call -name - allows to follow more legibly and live the activity of others - Twittos - i.e. those netizens whose messages -tweets - follow on the Internet or follow you.
This lets you know if they follow up on messages, if they pay to new accounts, if they qualify as favourites for any messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested - with a small percentage of users in August - before spreading it to the rest of the network on Monday, as indicated by AFP Twitter spokesman Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known for its little instinctive operation, with slightly esoteric terms (RT to forward a message from another person, followfriday to recommend to follow another user) making the initiated happiness, opens up to a wider audience with a more comparable handling than that of public networks Facebook and Google+.
On the network, users have debated with different opinions the interest of this innovation.
\"It's useless, it's invasive, and it looks too much like Facebook,\" writes @jemb123.
“The Activity function will help me better track some elements of my Twitter stream,” writes @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction of a \"gold rule\" budget in the Constitution
The Government of the great Social Democratic/Christian Democrat coalition that is in power in Austria has decided on Tuesday to include in the Constitution a \"gold rule\" budget to reduce the public deficit and thus avoid a possible degradation of Austria's sovereign note by credit rating agencies (triple A).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor, Werner Faymann, who announced this decision after a Council of Ministers, when the Austrian public debt reached 74.6%, a figure well above the 60% ceiling set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
\"If Austria's solvency was reduced on a single level, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay €3 billion more in interest each year,\" said the Christian Democratic Foreign Vice-President, Michael Spindelegger.
Austria thus responds to a request from the Brussels Summit to the euro area member countries of the past 26 October: the Heads of State and Government requested the inclusion, before the end of 2012, of the reduction of the public deficit and the recovery of the balance of public accounts in the Constitution or in a law of equivalent value.
The scheme adopted by the Austrian Government is closer to the German model, since Germany was the first European country to adopt that type of rule.
Prior to 2017, the structural public deficit should decrease annually by 0.75 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) and, as of 2017, the structural government deficit of the federal state should not exceed 0.35 per cent of GDP each year, while regional states, as well as municipalities, should present balanced budgets.
The objective is to reduce public debt by 60 per cent by 2020/2021.
A strong yell
Node threatens with a new intervention of the exchange market
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would intervene again the marked change if the yen continued to increase.
\"We will intervene, as we did last time, if we prove that there is excessive volatility - in the exchange rate of the yen, explained Noda to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose to levels close to the historical peaks that produced the intervention of the Japanese authorities on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo sold massively yen for dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had just reached a new record since 1945 compared to the U.S. currency.
But the yen has been stacking up gradually since then, driven by the purchases of investors who consider it a \"value refuge\" in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar has come back to Tuesday at less than 77 yen, and the euro has fallen below the symbolic bar of 105 yen, reaching levels close to those that caused the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was about 120 yen and the euro was over 160 yen.
This explosion of the Japanese currency harms the exports of the archipelago, as it strengthens the products Made in Japan and reduces the value of income obtained abroad by Japanese companies when they convert them to the national currency.
Japan is struggling to rebuild itself after the earthquake and tsunami of 11 March, which devastated the region of Tohoku (north-east), noted Noda, who fears that the encore of the yen's sharpness of the weak recovery.
The third world economic power has recovered growth in the third quarter (1.5 per cent in relation to the previous quarter), for the first time in one year, thanks to increased exports and consumption of disaster-affected households.
But the Prime Minister believes that the high level of the yen did not reflect Japan's economic bases.
The Minister of Finance, Jun Azumi, has asked the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Council on Tuesday, to take all possible steps to weaken the yen.
However, the Deputy Governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken appropriate measures, suggesting that greater monetary flexibility should not be expected on Wednesday.
During its last meeting at the end of October, the emission institute increased its purchases of Treasury Letters by five billion yen (EUR 47,000 million) to 55 billion yen (519 billion) the threshold of the funds devoted to the acquisition of various financial securities to flood the liquidity market.
Euro area:
The guys grow up, the bags flak.
The risk of debt crisis infection continues to harm the European indexes.
Despite the appointment of new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy, as well as better growth figures in France and Germany, the types of the most weakened countries continue to increase.
Still concerned about the stability of the euro area, European stock exchanges sink a little further in the negative zone on Tuesday, 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., the 40 CAC loses 1.4 per cent and stands at 3,064 points.
The Dax loses 0.4% in Frankfurt and in London 0.1%.
Taking into account new tensions in relation to the yields of the most affected euro area Member States' loans, the global markets continue to fall in their recent profits.
“The investors, nervous, are perfectly aware of the risk of contagion,” explains Terry Pratt, institutional corridor at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters agency.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange has closed with a fall of 0.7%, renewing the concerns of market participants regarding Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
‘Japan, like the rest of the world, has a fixed look in Europe and exchanges will continue to take place on a low margin of variation, so that investors will not have proof that the situation has stabilized,’ Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management, considers.
The recovery of concerns about the future of the euro area affects the single currency, which continues to fall on Tuesday.
The euro has been at its lowest level for a month and a half.
By 10 a.m., the European currency was worth $1,3570, a fall of 0.4%.
According to the runners, it has lost value after Chancellor Angela Merkel's party, the CDU, which met on Monday in Congress, adopted a motion which, in particular, foresees the option for a country in difficulty to leave the euro area without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish types outnumber 6%
The credit rates of Italy and Spain remain at a very worrying level.
On Tuesday morning, the performance of Italian obligations at 10 years was 6.85 per cent, while Spanish titles at the same time offered 6.2 per cent.
These tensions in relation to the interest rates of the countries of the South, although also in France, continue to fuel the fears of the interveners.
The head of the future Italian Government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for time to improve the situation in Italy, which is at risk of suffocating with the weight of his debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, for his part, has stated that the implementation of the decisions adopted at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October would be the \"chief work\" of his Government.
Spain is at the market point of view, while the legislative elections will take place on Sunday.
The difference between the 10-year-old obligations in Germany and Spain has reached a new historical peak.
Waiting for euro area growth figures
From a statistical point of view, France has recorded an economic growth of 0.4 per cent in the third quarter, i.e. a more favourable figure than 0.3 per cent expected, driven by domestic consumption.
Insee, however, has revised the second quarter figure to a low, with a 0.1% reduction in gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
In addition, the fourth quarter is what really worries economists.
Germany, for its part, has recorded 0.5% growth in the same period.
The first forecasts for the euro area as a whole are expected at 11 a.m. after the European Commission has warned about the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
facts must be worth more than dogmas
If there is a subject that cannot be addressed taking into account short-term considerations or simply thinking about emotions, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly influence the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is appropriate that an election meeting is the time to reflect on such issues and on the place of nuclear energy.
The debate will only be useful if it examines all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the options proposed.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, on rational data.
Now that we are 7,000 million people on the planet, demographic developments will imply the duplication of electrical demand by 2050, unless a huge part of the world's population is deprived of a vital element.
At the same time, the growing scarcity of fossil resources will have to be alleviated in order to continue to produce electricity, not to mention the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, an issue that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains alone in its decision to give up nuclear energy.
That is not the case or Belgium, which submits itss to the need to find a source capable of replacing it, or Switzerland, which aims only to build state-of-the-art power stations.
On the other hand, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to cite some examples, are continuing with determination with their projects.
The United States, for its part, after Fukushima decided to add a unit to its park, taking up the construction of an interrupted power station after the Three Mile Island accident.
If the German model, based on renewable energies, is sometimes presented as an example, reality goes against such a speech.
The Berlin election will entail an increase in the price of electricity, a greater energy dependence on the increased need for imported gas, in particular Russia, an increase in CO2 emissions by the construction of gas and coal plants.
In a few months' time, the harmful effects will be noted.
He must meditate on the case of Denmark.
Europe's champion in the wind sector, 30 per cent of which obtains electricity, is also one of the great users of coal and gas due to the intermittentness of the wind; for this reason, its CO2 emissions and the price of their electricity are, respectively, 65 per cent and 50 per cent higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbours pay an electricity bill of 40% higher than that of French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of the maintenance of industrial utility in the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For that reason, any significant reduction in nuclear energy would entail a strong rise in the price of electricity, which would leave realism to the wonderful declarations about the re-industrialization of our country and the defense of our purchasing power.
This is a price that the vast majority of French people refuse to pay and, in fact, do not express opposition in principle to that type of energy, according to the surveys.
Let us remember that our country's energy policy has lost the construction of an industrial sector with 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Widely export-oriented, it covers a galaxy of SMEs specializing in international markets and which can create non-localizable jobs.
If France decided to abandon nuclear energy, it would be the sacrifice of much of those SMEs and the loss of EUR 6 billion per year in French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
What electrician would be responsible for an EPR designed to function for sixty years, when the manufacturer's downfall is planned?
To solve the equation of nuclear energy, it must be admitted that there is no miraculous source of electricity production, as there is no diabolical source.
The development of Areva solutions with low CO2 emissions, both nuclear and renewable, demonstrates the complementary nature of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is essential to maintain the highest level of security.
In France, we have a Security Authority that exercises strict and transparent control over both existing power plants and the construction of Flamanville.
Our teams, of recognized professionalism, are also obsessed with security.
In the middle century, the nuclear sector has suffered three serious accidents.
Only one, that of Three Mile Island, occurred under normal operating conditions; it did not result in consequences for either people or the environment.
In Chernobyl, the accident was due to reactor design and unforgivable human failures.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was due to two natural disasters of unprecedented reach, which led to the death of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear sector will learn from this accident, as it did from the previous two.
Thanks to these progress and cooperation between the security authorities, and French and German operators and builders, the EPR presents a design capable of resisting such phenomena.
While studying it all the electrical actors who want to build a power plant, the interruption of their construction in Flamanville would be a great gift for the competitors of Areva and EDF, as it would leave them free to take the lead in the inevitable development of the nuclear sector.
It is essential and legitimate to look for the best energy options for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotion, dogmas and partisan maneuvers dominate such an important debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration, a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy implemented by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various points of view: the saturation of the police, judicial and administrative services subject to the policy of figures, the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of France's \"country of human rights\".
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students that has jumped the headlines, with the Minister of the Interior (see Libération newspaper of 23 May) proclaiming in the past that France - does not need foreign talents, workers or waiters -
However, it is rarely analyzed from an economic point of view.
The point is that, on this issue, there is enough consensus between the left and the right.
In the case of the right, Jacques Chirac set the direction by stating in 1976 that -900,000 unemployed should not be a problem for a country with about two million immigrant workers - while on the left, the tone fixed Michel Rocard explaining that France - cannot take care of all the misery of the world - in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, both the left and right shared the fear of invasion of the national territory by a multitude of Polish fountains.
On both sides, immigrants are considered to be a burden on French economy and society.
The only difference is in the degree of generosity with which they act with respect to immigrants.
In its programme, François Hollande is limited to including banalities, indicating that co-development will solve the \"problem of migration\"
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, perhaps it is cost-effectively, but economically very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in a recent work summing up the most recent knowledge about immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migratory flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
Limitation of immigration weakens growth and impairs employment.
Fears related to the impact of immigrants are based on the idea that they can replace national workers, in particular the low-skilled, by pressing for their wages to be reduced.
But experience shows that immigrants are, in fact, more complementary than substitutes for national workers and are mainly employed in sectors with a lack of employment.
Unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national workers and those most qualified in dynamic sectors where training does not meet the demand for staff.
A positive effect on wages
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country that lacks anesthetists, complementarity between nationals and immigrants leads to a positive impact on the wages and employment of nationals.
Taking into account the above, Giovanni Peri calculated that a 1% increase in migratory flows means a rise in real wages in the long term of between 0.6 and 0.9%.
And, without regard to the fact that the diversity of immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (there are a large proportion of naturalized American Nobel prizes and companies such as Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Immigrants are also net contributors to social systems, as they provide an average of 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The International Labour Organization estimates, for example, that in Germany, an immigrant who reaches the age of 30 will make a net contribution of EUR 150,000 to the average public budgets throughout his life.
At the beginning of his term of office, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go looking for the growth points that were missing - with his teeth -
These teeth, which deterred immigrants, had exactly the reverse effect.
Europe invented democracy, it just lacks thinking about a European democracy
Democracy is a precious but also fragile good.
The European continent should be able to remember that, although it was invented in Athens more than two thousand years ago, throughout the 20th century it has suffered the tragedies of the World War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some may have believed that, in order for democracy to definitely triumph over its enemies, it would be sufficient to exercise the vote and in the most direct way possible.
We know, from Napoleon - the Little One - that it was something thought of.
Universal suffrage, although it is a necessary condition for democracy, is not enough on its own and can even become an instrument of oppression, as the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot used to say.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and control of powers, an education, Lights, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis in Europe is an economic crisis, but it is about to become a political and democratic crisis.
In this regard, the palinody of the true-false Greek referendum had a twofold revealing effect: it showed the need for a powerful return of the political sphere, but also the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
It must be reflected on this ambivalentness to overcome it.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic battle have now shifted and that, in many cases, Republican soldiers are no longer moving in the right direction.
We will not win if we demand a succession of national referendums, organized according to needs and disorderly.
A blank signature to the absolute European monarch or a stop to the vacuum of the nationalist hole: what choices for the citizen!
No, we do not want to strike out of effect, but a common exercise, of full right, peaceful and continuous exercise, of options and democracy, this time at European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (in fact, we would not know where the list ends), because there is only one crisis, the crisis in Europe.
The whole of Europe is the one that is bound by the orders of markets and rating agencies, which suffer from their impotence and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that suffers from humiliation in the international sphere.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but it is the whole of Europe that slowly loses sovereignty and, with it, each of its nations.
The most urgent thing is that popular sovereignty recovers the momentum of the European project.
Because only together can Europeans reduce the burden of their debts, release themselves from the markets and prepare their future through investment.
The exit from the crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be taken without total democratic legitimacy, unless it is to lead us to disaster.
Having fought for a long time against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone today calls for European economic governance.
So be it.
But thinking about it without greater political and democratic integration, and without it being lived as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and lead us to a new point of death.
We must assume a new stage of European construction.
To build the Republic in France, it was necessary - to do - Republicans.
The Revolution motivated by interest would not be enough.
This lesson remains applicable.
We must build a more economically integrated Europe.
It can only be achieved by building a more democratic Europe at the political level, a true European popular sovereignty.
To build Europe, let us make Europeans.
Chip cards - no contact - are generalised
The world's chip card hall starts on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, with an optimistic atmosphere.
In fact, the year 2011 should end with an 11% increase in world sales of microprocessor cards (bank cards, SIM card phones, etc.), with a total of 6 billion units, according to Eurosmart cabinet calculations.
The most powerful segment is that of contactless technology, which allows you to pay for the common transportation or purchases simply by approaching the card to a reader.
This year will be sold worldwide 460 million cards with uncontacted chip, 320 million more than the previous year!
Its share should continue to rise in 2012 (over 580 million units) and represent about 10 per cent of the global chip card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe, which has been lagging behind for a long time with regard to the Asia-Pacific region, is gaining ground in the non-contact payment sector.
Around 26 million Visa bank cards already have this function, which is accepted in 75,000 payment terminals.
In France, their beginnings are more modest: 400,000 Visa cards are being used without contact.
But the large surfaces work for four.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million Pass MasterCard cards this year without contact.
In order to move ahead, however, it is necessary for banks to make them available to their customers.
\"There are two major French establishments that have committed themselves to spreading systematically in the future, among their customers, bank cards with no contact system,\" says Gérard Nebouy, Director General of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payment by mobile phone
But it is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
Currently, there are few devices equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology, which are essential for the conduct of transactions.
- They're rebounding.
\"But I should finally experience a real boom next year\"
“We expect to sell between 80 and 120 million units worldwide in 2012,” explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the lead.
The Crédit agricultura bank announced yesterday the launch of a test between December and next June in Caen.
The iPhones will be equipped with about 200 customers and collaborators with a fund that allows payment without contact.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseilles.
And the General Company has also said yesterday that it is preparing the marketing of an offer that allows its customers to pay without contact through their mobile phone.
From Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is on the rise
Paris is concerned about the links between Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and Boko Haram sect.
The links between the Al Qaeda terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect of Boko Haram, which had long been suspected, have been confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs Abdelkader Messahel even claimed that Algiers already - has the certainty -
“The way both organizations operate and the intelligence service reports show they are cooperating,” he explained, without providing any further details.
Paris seems to come to a similar conclusion.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two French people in Niger last January would have resumed the gateways.
Kidnapping in a Niamey restaurant by people related to Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory died the next day along with several of their kidnappers during an operation launched by the French special forces.
In the ruins of the intervention, French and Nigerian researchers discovered several telephone chips belonging to terrorists.
Terrorist Axis
The study of the calls made indicates to several interlocutors based on Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers particularly captured the interest of the researchers: one leads to a Nigerian who remained for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who, supposedly, is close to Aqmi and the sect.
\"This is progress, but we must certainly hope to have more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram\"
\"But it's possible.\"
“We have known for years that the sect has enjoyed financial and intellectual support outside and is increasingly active,” says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
These last few months, said - I support - have been increasingly evident in the evolution and discourses of Boko Haram or in its operating modes, which now involve the use of kamikazes or explosive devices that are increasingly complex and of the same style as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has since pressured Abuya to take into account the problems generated by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities, in fact, take time to consider the group as a community of illuminating little worth of interest.
A fast success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist magnet Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram (which means, in hausa, - Western education is a sin) incites the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the partnership is experiencing rapid success.
It is politicized and demands strict respect for sharia, while its militants are thrown into the fight against the impious central government.
The latter are oriented first of all to churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram's militants were particularly active and attacks on police stations multiplied.
Abuya's reaction was, as it usually happens, widespread.
The army attacked the city and registered 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested in life, receives death in prison.
Since then, the sect has radicalized and abandoned its northern fiefs.
Christmas passes, claims an attack that causes 80 dead in Jos and then another in Abuya.
In June, Boko Haram again attacked Abuya, in particular against the police's sheltered headquarters, with a suicide attack, the first of these.
In August, the headquarters of the United Nations became its first international objective.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which would cover from Mauritania to Somalia by passing through Nigeria, is a concern for all security specialists.
While Aqmi has attacked Mali and Niger and the Somalis of Al-Chebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram emerges as a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned him against Boko Haram and said he was willing to share all the information.
The world according to Republican candidates to the Presidency
In relation to China, Iran and with the help of Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete in simplicity and lack of knowledge.
An America weakened by the crisis, can manage a complex world with simple ideas or even simplistic ideas?
By listening to Republican candidates for the presidential, voters might think it is.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other candidates have been making more and more structural statements and shortcuts in foreign policy, traditionally a strong point of Republicans.
The slogans, often unfounded, about China, Iran, are extended to help Israel.
Mitt Romney, the best candidate in the race towards the designation of the Great Old Party, has threatened to lead the Chinese to the WTO and denounce them, by manipulating their currency, a key issue in an America exasperated by the migration of entire fragments from their sector to Asia.
It doesn't matter if that means the explosion of a commercial war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama's former Ambassador to China and the only candidate who has a sophisticated view of foreign policy, almost drowns in an attitude that — abulls — emotions.
He has called for a firm but constructive dialogue with Beijing ( Obama's current position).
But Huntsman, who remains stagnant in the depths of the probes, remains inaudible.
In the style of Reagan
Romney has also promised a military intervention in Iran if sanctions fail to interrupt its nuclear programme.
\"If I get elected, I'll stop Iran,\" he whispered.
\"If Obama gets re-elected, they'll have the bomb.\"
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing his obligations to that partner.
Employer Herman Cain, the second best-classed candidate, shows a shameful lack of knowledge of such issues for his part.
Recently, he was trying to counter the Chinese military threat because Beijing - trying to develop nuclear capacity - apparently ignoring the fact that China has already had the military atom since 1964.
Texan Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, says he is willing to deploy the U.S. army in Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, also presonates Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
The differences are considerable with the 2008 Republican candidate, John McCain, a heavy burden on foreign policy.
The opponents of the current President replied that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They remember that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to loosen the piston in the fight against terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of their naive dialogue with Iran, the hasty exit of the \"boys\" of Iraq and their hives in Libya, and label it weak.
But the attacks are not easy for them.
In a more positive way, the population judges Obama's national security balance, which ended with Bin Laden.
From Iraq, he was wary of the military interventions that led to a collapse.
And, arguing that it takes economic reconstruction of America to resurrect its leadership, Obama gives the impression of being fairer.
The North Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The North Stream pipeline, which communicates directly Western Europe with Russia passing through the Baltic Sea fund, has already been put into service.
It must supply gas to meet the needs of thirty million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with great pump.
Last Tuesday, more than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, took part on the shores of the Baltic, between the music of the orchestra and a delicate buffet, at the inauguration of the North Stream, the new pipeline that communicates directly, under the sea, Russia and Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart, Mark Rutte, have together turned the wheel of the valve controlling the Russian gas input into the Western European network.
With this new pipeline, there will be an additional 27.5 million cubic metres of Russian gas in Western Europe each year through a first of 1,224 km that communicate the St Petersburg region with the Mecklemburg-Pomerania Land.
A second tube should be completed by the end of 2012 which will provide a total of 55,000 million cubic metres of gas, i.e. enough to cover all French consumption.
In addition, there is already talk about the possibility of building a third tube on the same route.
For Gazprom, the in-time completion of this enormous work presents the airs of victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries had strongly opposed the project.
In fact, North Stream will allow gas to be supplied directly to Germany, avoiding the land passage by third countries (Poland and Ukraine).
Suddenly, these two countries lose some of their power: for them, it will be harder to influence Russia by threatening to shut down access to the markets in Western Europe.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare North Stream as a - a new German-Soviet pact - with reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is, if the issue is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, supporting the Russian project, has gained greater security of supply.
But the price is a weakening of Europe's energy, as the project has created a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
Russia has known, in just five years, to win its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, large gas consumers and with increasingly limited reserves.
“This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that unites us organically,” confirmed François Fillon during the opening of the pipeline, demonstrating to what extent the large gas sector contracts are both political and economic.
All this explains the wide smiles on the faces of Gazprom managers, numerous in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical achievement.
The submarine tube is made of cement-coated steel to protect it against the anchorages of the ships.
It is supported at the bottom of the sea, at an average of 200 m deep.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating from World War II.
“It was necessary to withdraw or destroy a hundred of them, as a precaution,” says Jens Müller, spokesman for North Stream society.
It was also necessary to extend measures for the protection of fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake that weighs as 242 Eiffel towers and is not interrupted throughout its length: neither by valves nor by maintenance stations.
There was provision for a water control platform in Sweden, but the project leaders gave up the same, seeing that the Swedes were not very willing to allow a Russian state society to establish itself permanently on the sea off its coast.
“In case of failure, we will interrupt the gas passage in less than a minute,” Jens Müller says.
In the event of a leak, the gas from the pipeline will therefore be released to the atmosphere.
But the builders consider it unlikely that a leak will occur, since they have planned joints that, according to the forecasts, will have a leak every 100,000 years.
The control of the state of the pipeline is ensured by a submarine robot, dragged by a vessel, carrying out external inspections, as well as by a device that circulates inside the pipeline.
With the shape of a pure, it is inserted into the inside of the tube, which has a diameter of one meter, and moves with the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full travel days at a speed of three meters per second, it provides accurate data on possible metal deformations.
The pipeline has been designed to operate for fifty years without any repair.
The circulation of the gas is guaranteed simply by the pressure.
At first it is 200 bars and, at the exit of 100 bars.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leading company is Gazprom, which has 51% of the shares.
It was joined by the Germans E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have created a joint venture called Nord Stream, which is responsible for building and exploiting the pipeline.
It has its headquarters in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is especially favourable.
Later, Gazprom rented the company, for a period of twenty-five years renewable, the entire gas transport capacity.
“Gazprom will pay you for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas that is actually being transported,” Jens Müller says.
The financing of the construction of the pipeline has been completed by 30 per cent with the input of the shareholders and by 70 per cent with bank loans.
The total cost of the work should reach EUR 7.4 billion for the two tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, investment has reached 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure that they will not exceed their investment, since Gazprom alone assumes the risk of spending.
The gas pipeline emerges from the Baltic in Lubmin, on a sandy coast planted with pine trees.
Some valves, 4.5 meters high, form the gas outlet door.
There are sensors that measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas on arrival, before it is transferred to the German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
At full capacity, it will be three million per hour and in 2012, six million.
Moleskine, a brand-name.
Created half a century ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to give people back the taste for writing.
It has an air of adventure, from writing hours to a candlelight.
The Moleskine bed is easily recognized, with its black rectangular pastes, its rubber, its broken white leaves, as aged for the time.
However, Moleskine notebooks with the present appearance were born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo, based in Milan, decided at that time to launch a note of design but distinguished notes to the market.
Maria Sebregondi, by that then company consultant, was responsible for the launch of the new product.
The note is inspired by an old production technique, the soft skin (top foot), which refers to a barnized cotton that was used, among other things, to cover the banquets.
This type of notebook was highly valued by writers and travelers.
“Moleskine has adapted to the current taste an old and forgotten object, an icon of the avant-garde artists until the 20th century,” says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become responsible for the brand in Mode.
And he achieved success.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26 per cent, up to a volume of 12.7 million units sold.
Far has remained the confidential production of the first years, in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine goes beyond the Italian borders and exports its products to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to determine the profile of the buyer, since the notebook attracts both businessmen and students and professionals.
Like Moleskine, its users are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultivated.
The small Italian company, which had 12 workers in its early stages, now owns about 100 and, since 2008, has two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
It distributes its notebooks in bookstores, from the Fnac to the small shops of the city centre, and has been able to impose its identity.
“We have adapted to the times and the need to write, despite the rise of emails,” explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural firm goes hand in hand with Moleskine's development: recently, the brand has launched the exhibition \"Detour\" where architects or artists exhibit their own notebook.
In August, he also launched a notebook with leopard tapas, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: bags, schedules, pens, computer fonds...The brand covers a wide range of supports.
A success that causes envy: in the fall of 2006, Mode was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, currently Syntegra Capital, thus writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers still so high?
Around 19 per cent of disabled persons are seeking employment.
The XV Week for the Employment of the Disabled begins today.
Despite a well-established public policy, since 2005, the unemployment rate among disabled people doubles the average rate: 19 per cent, compared to 9 per cent for the population as a whole.
Disappointment?
“No” says Éric Blanchet, Director General of Adapt, the partnership that organizes the week for the employment of the disabled.
The progress made over the past fifteen years is considerable.
At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice but three times higher than the average.
\"However, there is still a lot to be done.\"
It should be mentioned that disabled people continue to face numerous obstacles to access employment.
They tend to be older: 37% are over 50 years old (an average of 17%).
They have a low level of qualification: 80 per cent of them have not completed bachelor's degree and, of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is widespread among them: 53 per cent for the disabled, compared to 38 per cent for the average.
In other words, there are many issues that make it particularly difficult to return to the world of work and which - they constitute the quid of the problem - points out Christian Grapin, Director General of Tremplin, a partnership created in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
Those are the objective obstacles.
Moreover, there are those that are not mentioned; people's mentality advances, but too slowly.
A study carried out in April by the IMS-Enterprise for the City noted that the directors surveyed had a low level of knowledge about disabilities, with an excessive representation of people on wheelchairs, physically or intellectually disabled.
The result: private companies with more than 20 workers are far away from the goal of hiring 6% disabled workers, which was set out in a law of... 1987.
According to the latest available figures, dating from 2008 they reach a ratio of 2.6%.
“We now reach around 3%,” says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the agency responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not respect this law.
The test: the number of establishments - subject to this contribution - as well as the amounts disbursed, have decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
“The 2005 Act, which increased contributions, has generated a great deal of pressure for companies,” explains Pierre Blanc.
\"But this improvement also reflects a true awareness, particularly among large groups\"
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59 per cent of the companies with between 20 and 49 workers have employees with disabilities, compared to 82 per cent of the companies with between 100 and 199 workers.
Hazard: \"A Joy\"
About to face the Blues on Tuesday night (20h45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens do not hide the pleasure that this friendly party brings them.
We will not dare to say that there was connivity between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting next to each other, on the stand of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have actually made peace.
Five months after the act of resentment against Turkey, the Belgian selectionist has no more than praise for him.
\"I was very glad for Eden, for its progress and for its Belgian progress\"
\"I want to move forward,\" replied Lille's front.
As for the contrast between your presentations on your team and in the selection, a set has been justified.
In Lille, I'm all year round, which doesn't apply to Belgium.
\"I've got to get there.\"
Convoked to play against Romania on Friday night, taking into account this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis for, at last, \"brillar\"
Not to be forgotten about the pleasure
He has been encouraging the Blues since he was seven years old, as well as during the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
\"I've always been your fan,\" he says.
No doubt, that will especially strengthen the particular character of the meeting.
Especially because he will face Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) -, remember.
- We just faced each other a little while ago.
\"Playing against them is always a joy\"
With simplicity, Leekens has made a reference to pride on his part.
‘Pride by disputer — a gala-party
\"Pride - also to be checked, as \"neighbor\", that France is again a very high-level team - about a year after the trauma of Knysna.
“Laurent Blanc has done a great job,” she said enthusiastically.
While Belgium will not attend the next European competition, the technician would be delighted to be able to share aircraft with the Blues towards... Brazil, in 2014.
\"Our little Belgians are growing up,\" he said.
\"We're building something; the players are ambitious, they're hungry.
\"You can see it in the next matches,\" including the party against France.
Portugal shows great confidence
The Portugal of Paulo Bento faces a great optimism for the party back against Bosnia (22:00), which will be held on Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the game of going, they lacked realism to both teams.
“When these 90 minutes pass, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country”
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
There is no doubt; the Selectao, which has been running since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 Euro Cup.
Indeed, only 90 minutes separate Portugal from happiness.
But there's a game to play and a rival, Bosnia, to defeat.
Taking into account the departure party (0-0), on Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems clear that the thing is not decided.
Portugal dominated the party for more than an hour, yes, but was unable to mark the valuable goal that would have given it tranquility.
\"It's a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, since we haven't marked out of the house\"
But at home, at the bright Lisbon Light Stadium, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, before an audience that should be equally enthusiastic, even if it is evident that the party - it is very equal -, said an optimistic but lucid Bento.
\"We hope the party is very equal, but we are fully convinced that we can take the lead,\" said 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
\"We still have a 50% chance to participate in the 2012 Eurocopa,\" said Carlos Queiroz's successor.
Friday's draw in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to mark and win.
The Bosnians could get a tie, but they also need to score.
“It’s a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, since we haven’t marked out of the house,” Bento laments.
“We are going to play against a team that has a great technical quality and has players with a great individual quality,” he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will go with the intention of exercising, from the beginning, a maximum pressure on the Bosnians to - do not give them time to think about -
A good idea, provided that, this time, it's realistic.
