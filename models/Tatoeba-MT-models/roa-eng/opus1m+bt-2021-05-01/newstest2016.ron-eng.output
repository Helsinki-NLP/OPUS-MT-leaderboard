UN Chief Says There Are No Military Solutions in Syria · Global Voices
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon states that his response to Russia's military support for Syria is that there is no military solution to the conflict that lasts nearly five years and more weapons would only aggravate the violence and suffering of millions.
The UN Chief again called on all parties, including the UN Security Council divided to unify and support negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said on Wednesday at a conference that he intends to meet this month with the foreign ministers from five permanent countries present at the Council - the United States, Russia, China, England and France - on the occasion of the ministerial session of the General Assembly to discuss Syria.
Ban expressed regret that the divisions in the councils between the Syrian people and the regional powers had made this situation unresolved and
Ban asked the five permanent members to demonstrate the solidarity and unity shown when they managed to conclude an agreement on Iran's nuclear weapons, thus addressing the Syrian crisis.
8 numbers of polls showing that Donald Trump has real chances
Some have tried to label him as a flip-flop politician
Others called it a joke.
And others expect the implosion.
But no matter how some Republicans try to tear Donald Trump down from the top of the polls, it didn't work (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national surveys have shown that Donald Trump leads with a percentage of two figures and some voices start to seriously wonder what this means for the chance of real estate mogul appointment.
Of course, it's still premature.
None of this says that Trump will win the race for the nomination of Republicans.
Pundits shows that in the same period of 2011, Rick Perry's advance took place with Herman Cain in the polls, but none of them won any state in the nomination race.
And the reasons why they would fight hard at the general elections are numerous.
But outside groups such as Jeb Bush's Super CAP and the conservative economic group Club for Growth admit Trump's power and start supporting him with money.
Below are some recent polling numbers suggesting that the real estate mogul is not just a passing thing:
The figures indicating Trump's support have returned to 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a survey conducted by the University of Monmouth showed that only two out of 10 Republicans had a positive view of the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, the percentage rose to 40%.
At the beginning of August, it was 52%.
Six out of 10 Republicans now have a favorable opinion about Donald Trump.
About three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion.
These figures are maintained.
A survey conducted last week by Quinnipiac in Iowa concluded that 60% of the republicans in the region had a favorable view of Trump.
Two-thirds of the GOP voters would be happy if Trump were to win the nomination race.
In a survey conducted last week by CNN/ORC, 67% of the Republicans said that they would be slanting and or raising their reputation and if Trump would win the nomination race.
Only two out of 10 says that they would be killed and if Trump would win the nomination race.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43%) states that he would be sham and 40% declare the same thing about Trump).
The closest to enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio, only 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters claim that it would be the same dream and/or defeat if the favorite Jeb Bush wins the nomination race.
Most Republicans don't consider Trump's temper a problem.
Although Donald Trump was strongly criticized for his bombistic insults as well, 52% of Republican voters at the national level believe that the real estate mogul has the right temperament to be so, according to the survey conducted on Monday by ABC News/Washington Post.
We give the same figures in the state of Iowa, where all 52% of Republicans believe Trump has the right personality to be ruler, according to the survey conducted last week by Quinnipiac.
However, 44% feel that he does not have the personality to act effectively and almost six out of 10 independents say that his temper does not have what he is looking for in the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When I take the attitude of intellectuals, Republican voters believe Trump is authentic.
According to a survey conducted last week by CNN/ORC, when asked who has the most chance to win the GOP nomination race, four out of 10 said Trump.
The situation has changed since the end of July, when four out of 10 would have bet on Jeb Bush.
Full information: In the past, the GOP voters have not read the future very well.
At the same time as the last election, four out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry in the nomination race, and only 28% for Mitt Romney.
However, these figures show that most GOP voters consider Trump's campaign plausible.
Even if the Republicans or relented to another candidate, Trump is still at the forefront of everyone.
Some voices say that the divided situation will likely contribute to Trump's victory, while support against Trump will be divided to more than twelve candidates.
But a survey conducted at the beginning of September by the University of Monmouth shows that, in the hypothetical situation of a collaboration between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump will almost always benefit from majority support.
Trump is 13 points away from Carly Fiorina, 14 points from Marco Rubio, 15 points from Walker, 19 points from Jeb Bush and 33 points from Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
It's almost equal to Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to beat him?
Ben Carson would beat the business man with 19 points in a hypothetical one-to-one confrontation.
Most of Donald Trump's supporters say they've decided.
A new survey conducted on Tuesday by CBS/NYT shows that more than half of the voters who support Trump say they do not change their vote.
Obviously, much can happen in this sense and no one can say that they will never change their mind.
46% claim that they leave the door open to change their option.
However, Trump's most important opponent is currently the Ben Carson neurosurgeon, but it is twice as likely that voters who say they have decided to vote with Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico the survivors and in the opening speech of his campaign two months ago, immigration was the central subject in the 2016 campaign.
Some are concerned that Trump's bomb style will lead to a split between important Hispanic voters and the Republican Party and will damage rebranding efforts.
However, according to the survey conducted by ABC/Post on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
So, apparently as long as the immigration problem remains in the spotlight, so will Doland Trump.
Frustration and authorities touch new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now supported by almost half of the Republican voters, largely due to their status as outsiders.
According to the survey conducted on Monday by ABC/Post, six out of 10 Republicans say they prefer a political outsider to the detriment of someone with experience in government.
People are also upset about the Washington authorities.
A two-week survey conducted in Iowa by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated by the performance of the republicans in Congres, 54% declaring themselves \"hungry\" and 21% snowballing at the top
Jeremy Corbyn debuts at Prime Minister's Questions
Ever since his election, Mr. Corbyn's debut at PMQs was long awaited
The new leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, will later make his debut at Prime Minister's Questions, facing for the first time with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will address the first of the six questions to which he is entitled shortly after lunch; his performance will probably be analysed closely by the media and Labour MPs.
During the weekly appearances, he asked for more theaters and more facts.
He also said he could give up a few participants and give them to his colleagues.
The confrontation will be Mr Corbyn's first parliamentary test in the leadership position, coming after he called a ghost cabinet and after the speech he held on Tuesday at the annual TUC congress.
Meanwhile, the decision of the leader of the Labour Party to keep silent about the national anthem in a job held on Tuesday on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of England drew criticism from conservative parliamentarians and gained the first page of the newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem paid attention
A spokesperson for Mr Corbyn said that he kept silent respectfully and acknowledged the heroism of the British Air Forces in England's Battle
But a member of the ghost cabinet of Mr. Corbyn, Owen Smith, said for the two's Newsnight broadcast by the BBC that he would have recommended that the Labour leader sing the national anthem and his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
About twelve ministers in the phantom cabinet refused to be part of Mr Corbyn's front team, arguing by differences of opinion related to economy, defence and external, while less than a half of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
The BBC Political Correspondent Robin Brant states that the political differences in the Labour Party also accumulate after Mr Corbyn's appointment of his position and the European Union and the limit of benefits.
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that the Labour Party will make changes through which the idea of limitation will be eliminated entirely.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, Minister of Labour and Pensions, said that the party was very clear and in exclusive opposition and the government's plans to reduce the level of the head and from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron faces at the rostrum in the last decade, since he took over the leadership of the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader, who promised a different approach to politics, says that he has ideas from external sources and questions to be addressed by Lord Cameron and that he has received over 30,000 suggestions.
Parliamentarian Islington North said that PMQs involve too high a level of confrontation and that it will refrain from repeated attacks, committed to instead focus on serious problems such as poverty, inequality and challenges faced by young people.
Mr. Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the Finance Minister, will hold her place at PMQs when he cannot participate - for example when Mr. Cameron moves abroad.
He also expressed the idea that he would allow other colleagues to take the occasional word, saying he approached the President of the Chamber of Deputies, John Bercow, to discuss this issue.
In 2005, when he took over, Mr. Cameron said that he wanted to give up the political style of \"Punch and Judy and often associated with PMQs but acknowledged a few years later that he did not succeed in his move.
Since the first transmission, in 1990, PMQs has been considered a key barometer of the reasoning of a leader, the way in which he leads the Chamber of Deputies and his position among parliamentary colleagues, although critics have claimed that it has become a cartoon and that it needs a thorough reform.
‘Cadru in Joburg and: Youth without shelter benefit from photo courses
It's hard to be a homeless man in Johannesburg.
But a group of people who lived on streets in childhood found a way to learn a job and gain their life.
“I was shot in Joburg and is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless young people to take pictures of the areas where they live and earn money from it.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of the project.
Chief JD Sports says that higher wages could hurt expansion
President JD Sports, Peter Cowgill, says that an increase in minimum wage in the UK could mean greater purchasing power in potential consumer pockets and
However, that purchasing power is likely to exceed the higher labour costs within the firm, he said.
Costs could impact JD Sports' expansion plans, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by President Tennis Australia, Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis would deserve to be praised and not criticized for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was a collateral victim in the storm and created around his friend Nick Kyrgios, and his behavior is more worthy of praise and not critical, in the opinion of Dennis Australia, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the younger part of the talented duo often called \"Special Ks, and was dragged unscathed into the spotlight by the scandalous derapture that Kyrgios had from Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters tournament.
In a short-time qualifying game played in Cincinnati, the chair referee had to intervene twice to separate Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, after which Harrison said: “Wawrinka should have put Kyrgios on the ground, and I should have put him on the ground for this kid.”
Although he was last seen doing a dust rocket after he had muscle cramps and missed a possible US Open tournament, upset Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was firmly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, where he fights with Sam Groth for the second to the individual, after Bernard Tomic in the semifinal of the Davis Cup against England.
“One thing I feel is that, in my opinion, Thanasi was drawn a little into conflict and said Healy.
The truth is that he broke a racket when he lost because he accused cramps in the US, but he's not the first player to break a racket out of frustration and himself and I know Thanasi well enough to know he wouldn't proud of it.
But let's be serious and, uh, it's been extremely good in the rather provocative situations in the US with Harrison and so on, and I think it's worth a lot of confidence.
He's got a great team, he's got a great family next door, and I think he's been treated wrong.
He is a 19-year-old very mature, hard-working and has joined the team, had no conflict with the other players, he is very respected in the dressing, he is hard-trained, he is in an excellent form, he is a very well-balanced and mature young man and I think he deserves to be judged solely on the basis of his qualities and shortcomings.
Healy also supported the decision not to take Kyrgios into account for the important retirement match, which begins Friday, and described the joint decision as the most appropriate for all, but supported the long-term return of the player from Canberra to the team.
“First of all, we want the team to focus entirely on the game of resignation and not to think at all about the controversy around [Kyrgios], and Healy said.
And I think Nick has come up very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray have said, he's grown up under the eyes of the public and made some terrible mistakes and deserves to be criticized, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions and I think he needs a time when he's not at the center of attention to be able to reflect, good thing for both the team and for him.
2016 Elections: Hillary Clinton's advantage in front of Bernie Sanders was halved in national polls
Former State Secretary Hillary Clinton still has a two-digit advantage in the democratic race for national candidacy, but Senator Bernie Sanders holds ground.
Clinton is now supported by 47% of the democratic voters (down from 58%), while Sanders is in second place, 27% (up from 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he will be a candidate for president, is supported by 15% of the voters of democracy.
At least five months before the start of the primary elections, most democratic voters say it is too early to say that they have decided on the candidate they will support.
However, Clinton's supporters are firmer in their choice than supporters of other candidates.
The fact of the survey conducted by the CBS news last month, Clinton lost ground in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders won a few percentages.
Clinton retains the advantage among women and moderation, but the advantage has decreased.
Support among men has decreased considerably and Sanders is only 5 points away.
Clinton's advantage among the voters of democracy under the age of 50 has evaporated, being now equal to Sanders.
However, Clinton still benefits from the old voters.
Last month, Clinton was in front of Sanders, with a percentage of two figures among liberals, but Sanders now has an easy 5 point advantage in this group.
About half of the national democratic voters say they would eagerly support Clinton if he had chosen to run on behalf of the party.
A quarter would support it somewhat reserved and another 15% would only support it because it represents the party.
Six percent wouldn't support it.
Perhaps surprisingly, Clinton's current supporters are likely to be excited about its choice is high.
Opinions are more mixed among those who do not currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would support her with enthusiasm.
While 48% of the democratic voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, the number of Republican voters who declare the same thing about the first class, Donald Trump (35%) is smaller.
When Clinton's supporters are asked an open question about why she would like to win the race, the majority answer is that she has the right experience (16%), followed by the fact that it was time for a woman to be and (13%) and that she is the best candidate for this function (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mention her association with Bill Clinton (9%).
The agreement on these issues and eligibility is also mentioned.
Given that the vice president is considering a possible candidate for presidents, 57% of the democratic voters would like to see him run - although a third I think he should not run.
In the question of the second option for the party's representative, democratic voters call Biden a majority.
Among Clinton's supporters, more than half said Biden would be the second option, long before Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton's advantage in front of Sanders grows, from 20 points with Biden running to 30 points if he does not run.
55% of the democratic voters consider Clinton to be the candidate with the greatest chances of winning the general elections; but the figures dropped from 78% to 78% last month.
Biden is at a distance in place two but the percentage that it is the most eligible has grown.
However, when asked what is most important to a chosen candidate, democratic voters prefer the issues instead of the eligibility.
Like last month, no democratic candidate or possible candidate is considered unacceptable by these voters as a representative of the party in the presidential race.
Democrat candidates or potential candidates do well with respect to a number of key features and primary party voters.
Most voters consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be trustworthy integrity and strong leadership qualities.
Biden is seen the best of all three in terms of integrity, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
30% of the democratic voters do not believe that H. Clinton is integrated and reliable, twice as much as those who say this about Sanders (15%), but 27% do not have an opinion about him in this regard.
Democratic voters also generally believe that the three, Clinton, Sanders and Biden, have the same ideologies as they do.
In all these respects, about a quarter of the voters of democracy have no opinion of Sanders.
As the questions persist regarding the use of a personal email address and a server by Hillary Clinton while he was Secretary of State, the majority of democratic voters are grateful for his explanation of the subject and say that he did not affect their general and candidate opinion.
But things are different among the American public.
Half of Americans are now unhappy with her explanation, while only about a third are thankful.
The public opinion was divided in March on this subject, shortly after the issue emerged.
Most Americans say that this controversy about email has not affected their general view of Clinton, although 36% say they have changed their views negatively.
Most Republicans, more than six out of 10, say they have changed their views about Clinton in a negative sense.
Although the democratic voters consider Clinton to be an integrity and confidence, this aspect continues to raise problems among voters at the general level: only 32% consider it to be integrity and trust, with 8% less than last month and 15% less than in May.
62% of voters do not consider it integrity and trust.
At the same time, 55% of national voters do not consider Trump to be trustworthy integrity.
However, both Clinton and Trump have white balls for leadership.
Of the six candidates assessed, Biden, Carson and Bush are first classified as regards integrity.
The number of those who consider Sanders integrity is greater than those who are not of the same opinion, however, as in Carson's case, and do not have an opinion about it.
The error margin for the sample of 351 primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Five members of the frat under charges for killing the student in the year 1 from Baruch's Faculty
Almost two years after a college student lost his life during a launch ritual in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, five people were charged with murder.
Members of Pi Delta Psi's Friars at the Baruch Faculty in New York brutally attacked Chun and Michael and Deng during a initiation ritual in September 2013 and postponed him to the hospital, which contributed to his death, according to police statements.
Official sources say that the victim was tied to the eye, put in the back a backpack of 14 kg full of sand and was repeatedly hoisted while trying to head towards a target, on a frozen ground.
Mr. Deng accused headaches after losing his knowledge.
The members of Pi Delta Psi's brother did not call the emergency number after he passed out and pretended to have waited an hour before taking him to the hospital, the police say.
But they found time to change Deng's clothes, look for his symptoms on Google, and contact Andy Meng, the president of the brotherhood at national level, to ask for advice, the chief of police said, Chris Wagner, at a press conference.
\"At this point, members began to hide their personal property and practically put the good of the brotherhood ahead of Michael Deng's good and said Wagner.
He couldn't be resurrected and died the next day in the morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng suffered repeated head trauma, trunks and thighs.
\"Many families were devastated by the rituals of the brothers, in 1970 at least one student lost his life every year because of the rituals and said Douglas Fierberg, Deng's family lawyer, in a statement.
The brothers and their members must be held accountable and this measure taken by the authorities is important.
The grand jury of Monroe district recommended that the first five members be charged with murder of the third degree.
Thirty-two other members of the brotherhood, including Mr Meng, will also be accused of being outrage and complicity in murder.
“We want to take responsibility not only for the people involved but, if there is an organization that has authorized the brothers, the official or the unofficial, we will also fire it to responsibility and said Wagner on Tuesday at a press conference.
Baruch's faculty banned the brothers and the national brothers withdrew their membership with the local representative.
This is what will happen when the Federal Reserve increases the interest rate.
The rate of interest will increase and the bull market (streets in town) will collapse, bond profitability will increase and the economy will fall into recession.
That's what we know.
What we don't know is how long it will be and how long it will take.
In the economy, history provides evidence of time frame..
After the first rate of interest, the recession occurred in only 11 months and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates is often, although not always, a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets respond.
Therefore, US central bank officials have emphasized so strongly that investors should not focus on the moment when interest rates begin to rise but on the path to the time needed for normalisation.
Indeed, there are multiple variables in the game.
However, in the end, market players might notice that all the unrest related to the growth of the interest rate has been exaggerated.
“The first part of the interest rate decided by the Fed after the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some voices as a sign of the cheap Albanian era and Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, said in a note addressed to customers.
On the other hand, we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to more normal levels but still small to constitute the seismic shock that everyone seems to be afraid of.
But it can't be said that there will be no effects.
We continue to present how some sectors of the economy might react, based on historical trends:
In view of the market situation in recent months, anticipating interest rate growth can volatile things for a while.
But, at the moment, the impact is not that dramatic.
“It seems that there is a tendency for the capital’s profitability to stagnate for 12-24 months after the first time, which reflects can again the defeat of monetary policy and told Deutsche Bank’s analysts in a recent study on what will happen after the Fed increases.
Specifically, in the last 35 years, the market has risen sharply - with about 14 percentages - moving towards the rise of interest rates, quite invariable over the period of 250 days after (average increase of 2.6%) after returning to normal after 500 days, with an average return in the last six cycles of 14.4%, according to a recent analysis published on Barron by the head of Nuveen Asset Management.
Deutsche said that the impact on actions has a tendency to become pronounced later in the interest rate growth cycle and benefits are beginning to fall.
The recession is a reality of economic life but the rise in interest rates often contributes to it.
In the present situation, Fed faces conditions that did not exist before and that could accelerate a recession.
Specifically, the gross domestic product will approach its historical minimum point for an increase in Fed interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, of the 118 rise in interest rate after 1950, only twice the nominal GDP was less than 4.5%.
Although in the second quarter of 2015 the value was 3.6%, and it is expected that the situation will persist, the third quarter reaching only 1.5%, according to Atlanta Fed.
The rise in interest rate in such a fragile economy could be risky and could raise the question if this time is different and Deutsche said.
The players on the market have been prepared all year round for a safety decision by the Fed, and all eyes are attending this week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Commission, which ends Thursday.
Although many of the strategies and economies believe that the WTO could approve an increase in the interest rate at this meeting, the long-term transactions indicate a probability of only 25%.
“In our study conducted after 1950, all interest rate growth cycles have so far been in a super growth cycle of profit, GDP escalating peaks before the recession very rapidly after the recovery began and reported the report.
On the other hand, this was a strange recovery of slow after the worst recession in the period analyzed.
The current cycle is by far the longest expected by the Fed since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and it reached 74 months and continues.
Fixed income was also volatile considering that the market anticipates an increase in interest rate and the pattern is somewhat similar to that of dividends.
The main difference is that the impact is faster in the case of bonds than in the case of actions when Fed changes the policy.
In the case of bonds, the benefits appear to change direction as soon as the first and/or fall in the cycle occurs.
At the end of the interest rate growth cycle, the return on bonds decreases immediately and Deutsche said.
The Charles Schwab strategies are of the opinion that these interest rate increases will lead to the nearness of profitability between short-term and long-term bonds, flattening the curve.
High-income bonds are better managed in such an environment, although we are still careful about the strength of profitability and stated in a Kathy Jones analysis, a fixed-income analyst in Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already adapted to Fed's expectations of policy.
\"Besides the power of the dollar and the reduction of estimated inflation, there are a few signs that the market has adapted to the perspective of a more rigorous monetary policy and wrote Jones.
Short-term interest rates have increased, the profitability curve is fairer, the average credit interest rate spread has expanded and volatility has increased - all market characteristics when Fed takes up politics.
In large lines, companies that perform their majority activity in the US will have gained from increasing interest rates and local products will become more attractive.
Multinationals with large debts will suffer because the growth of the dollar will lead to their expensive products in the global market space and their debt will be more expensive.
‘History shows that high-quality stocks and tend to be more profitable within three months of an initial increase in interest rate and told the analyst Goldman Sachs in a report to customers.
Firms with strong balance sheets exceeded those with a weak balance sheet after each increase in interest rates from 1994, 1999 and 2004, with an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with large capital and low volatility deposits also exceeded similar companies with lower quality, with an average of 4 (percentual points), and 3 (percentual points).
The debt will become a major problem.
Companies with a large percentage of floating debt have the most to lose, says Goldman.
Consumers will also win from the end of the dollar.
Those who save may also have won, although experts do not agree on how quickly this will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy after Classic FM, MP Andrew Bingham says
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticized the radio post because you cheated.
It states that it is becoming more and more similar to the commercial opponent
He also took the BBC Music Awards eye, claiming they plagiarized Brits awards.
Comrade Damien Collins attacked The Voice, stating that this show is not original.
BBC Radio 3 turns into Classic FM, said an important parliamentarian, putting pressure on the post to prove that he does something that commercial posts don't do.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also sent them to the BBC chiefs that the radio station and the prosthetics and looks more and more like the commercial opponent.
“I feel that Radio 3 ‘prosthes and - although I don’t like to use the word - but I feel it turns into Classic FM, and he said.
He also took on the BBC Music Awards, released last December.
BBC Music Awards, released last year, seems to be Brits under another name.
So if you're trying to do something different - these are the two examples that come to mind that only make you copy what's already on the market and Mr. Bingham said.
The BBC Director General denied the charges, stating that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of his commercial opponent in regard to live music and public education.
I'm not going to find out anywhere about the classic music I hear from Radio 3.
And his commitment to live music and production has no rival.
“In addition, I think it is also important the commitment of the Radio 3 post to discover new music and allocation of new pieces and he said.
In the first part of this year, BBC Radio 3 editor Alan Davey said that he must make more efforts to attract the audience and the previous period because the British have less knowledge of classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element under the BBC label criticized during the meeting of the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport because it would go on the trail of its rivals.
Conservative MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC talent show from the Dutch producer Talpa Media for the amount of approximately £22 million.
Do you understand why there are often discussions about that issue because it is not original and is not distinguished by anything?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - having Paloma Faith and Boy George in the jury - be held in a BBC-specific manner
He added that he wanted that the corporation he knew found the chicken with golden eggs in its own ogre and the next time he launched a entertainment show.
However, he refused to ban the future taking of new seasons in The Voice or to spend money on licenses on other forms of entertainment.
Internet sales registered the smallest city in August and the guilty could be Black Friday
In the first three months of 2015, online sales increased by 7%.
The last month has been the slowest since 2000 to date.
Online sales took place three years ago, thanks to the use of the mobile phone to make purchases.
The experts believe that Black Friday in November could lead to a reluctance to spend.
For over a decade, online shopping has exploded and turned the shopping streets of Britain into ghosts.
However, the experts say that there are signs that online sales are decreasing, the latest figures indicating a growth of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
Total money spent in August presented the smallest city from 2000 to today, with a growth of only 5% in the last year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are decreasing, the latest figures indicating a growth of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
“If we analyze the level of growth in previous years and return to 2000, there has always been a rationalized trend in time and Andy Mulcahy, editor at the IMRG sales index, told the Guardian.
He explained that online sales took place three years ago when buyers started using their mobile phone to make purchases.
Thus, it increased the number of people who could shop online and could do it under different circumstances, such as on the couch.
But now that you're stagnant, I could notice a decrease (increase).
The Black Friday Phenomenon, imported from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the decrease in sales.
In the opinion of the specialists, the buyers would refrain from making purchases before the event that takes place last Friday in November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers were stuck in front of computers to put their hands on offers, which led to the collapse of sites more retailers.
Specialists believe that Black Friday, when buyers have beaten themselves on chilies, could lead to the reticence of buyers.
A study published by the British Retail Consortium found that at least £1 out of every £5 is spent online.
In the case of certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of the purchases are currently made through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people prefer to buy clothes and shoes online than to call fashion stores in commercial areas.
Following the sanction of the Bin Laden family, Muslims bury the victims killed following the collapse of the Macharal in Mecca
The bodies of 29 of those who lost their lives were walked through the streets of Muslims, the first funerals taking place in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia partly invaded the giant in the building of Saudi Binladin Group for crashing.
Minister of Health said that in total 394 people were injured following the collapse of the macaral
In the walking ceremony on the street, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed because of a macaroni collapsed at the great mosque in Mecca.
Dressed in white, those who complained about their deaths joined on the road to express their condolences, until the first death reached the end of the final journey, at the Al-Moassem cemetery.
The sad memory kept by the holy place, where only a few days ago a construction mask collapsed through the wall of the mosque, falling on the believers.
The bodies were released for funerals after the King of Saudi Arabia sanctioned the bin Laden family construction group for the disaster, which also soldiered 394 wounded.
In the ceremony on the street, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed because of a macaroni collapsed at the great mosque in Mecca.
Among the victims were the father of four children, Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Great Manchester, who was found in his first pilgrimage when the macaroni collapsed.
Mr Akram was in the Mosquee Sea with his parents before the annual hajj pilgrimage began.
Saudi authorities have already promised that hajj pilgrimage to Mecca will continue, thousands of pilgrims still arriving in the city.
Today, King Salman said that Binladin Group should not have left the arm of the macaral elevated when the macara was not in operation.
A Arabic version of the decree, published by the Saudi Press Agency, stated that the Binladin Group was partly guilty of collapsing.
The English service of the news agency did not present that detail, but stated that the company's leaders were banned from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman swore to reveal what caused the macareal collapse in the courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims came before the Hajj pilgrimage that takes place later this month.
The Binladin Group has not yet made statements about the collapse of the macaral and the representatives of the Group could not be contacted for the statements.
The royal decree blamed the group for not using updated safety measures and did not coordinate its activity with the weather authorities.
Tens of macaroni surround the Great Moschee of Mecca, as part of the massive construction effort led by the Binladin Group.
For decades, the Binladin family has had a close relationship with the royal family of Saudi Arabia and is running major construction projects.
The last leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was a born-in-law son and disbanded of his family in the '90s.
The collapse occurred under heavy wind and rain, just days before the arrival of millions of people in the kingdom to participate in pilgrimage, essential travel at least once in the life of each physically fit Muslim.
Authorities say 158 people remain in the hospital.
The authorities decided that the relatives of the deceased victims would receive one million Saudi Riali (174,000 pounds) and the same amount to be paid to those with permanent injuries.
Other injuries will get half of this amount.
Advantages and disadvantages of conversion of loans to Swiss francs
On the bank market, two conversion bids to the Swiss francs have already appeared, with the main advantages being the exclusion of foreign exchange risk and the reduction of rates.
The disadvantages may come in a few years, when the variable charge can lead to higher rates.
Banca Transilvania has just completed the process of converting credits to francs granted by Volksbank, and Bancpost has announced conversion bid for its customers.
According to accumulated data from financial portal analyst FinZoom, Bancpost offers three years of fixed interest to lei, 1.5%, the smallest on the market.
On the other hand, the conversion offer of the Transilvania Bank was accepted by 83% of the credit customers in francs due to the second successive reductions: the balance with the value of the risk commissions and the paid administration of the customer was reduced, then an additional reduction of 22.5% to the balance in the lei was applied.
Both offers reduce the rates of their customers, as far as they paid equivalent monthly in lei before conversion.
Thus, Banca Transilvania reduces the rate by 42.5% and Bancpost by 33% in the first three years and, theoretically, by 18% in the following years.
Benefits
The main advantage of the coversion in the lei of loans in CHF is that the currency risk is eliminated, the consumer being protected by future franc increases, and the repayment of the credit will be made in the currency in which his salary falls.
Another major advantage of both conversion offers is that property is not re-evaluated, additional guarantees are no longer required, and another evidence of income.
In practice, there will not be a new financial and legal analysis of the credit and there will be no additional costs as in the case of a refinancing.
Also, both banks offered discount to the monthly rate, as much as the customers paid before conversion, equivalent to the lei.
Risks
The problem is that the rate in the first years is formed more of the doband, and the client pays very little of the principal.
Bancpost offer with very small doband in the first three years seems advantageous to customers.
But it's not known how it's gonna evolve after three years.
The margin offered to customers can be more than 3.25%, so overall, and the cost reduction is smaller.
A possible risk for all credits in variable interest lei, is that ROBOR indices will increase significantly over the next few years (more than the Libor - CHF index).
For example ROBOR at three months is now 1.44%, but in 2013 it reached 6%, in 2009, more than 15%, and in a few days since 2008 it exceeded 40%!
In addition, other costs may arise, not mentioned in the original offer.
The time has come for decisions on the interest rate for the US Federal Reserve
The world has also looked at the scheduled meeting in two days, Wednesday and Thursday, when the U.S. Federal Reserve will make the crucial decision whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time after about a decade.
In a survey conducted by Reuters with the participation of 80 savings, and over half that last week believed that the decision would be made, I now believe that the situation will be maintained for a while and that interest rates will be kept within the current range of 0-25%.
It's a historic event because it's been seven years since the Federal Reserve brought the rates to zero.
For the first time, we are facing a situation where a major central bank could give up the zero rate and start a process of normalization of interest rates and said Angel Ubide, chief analyst at Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy has evolved relatively well, with recovery bringing trillions of dollars in the balance sheet and generating a low level of inflation.
But the Federal Reserve must not ignore the global situation less pink.
He warned the markets to prepare for a growth but there are signs that even they believe that such a move is even more likely.
The decision will be announced on Tuesday, 20:00 CET.
See that they lost their charm
The actor (left), along with his son Redmond (right), has experienced stressful situations in recent years.
In 2001 he struggled with leukemia and in 2009 lost his life partner, Farrah Fawcett, in front of cancer.
It is alleged that the actor would have faced the drug problem and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All of this is certainly cost-effective.
The player Luke Shaw from Manchester United is standing on the bar for a few months because of double fractures.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture at his right foot in the Manchester United match in the Champions League, ended with a defeat in front of PSV Eindhoven.
After the event that brought tears to the player's eye and that will keep him on the deck for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains optimistic that Shaw will be able to play this season again.
The accident occurred after an unsuccessful intervention by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute, after Shaw, 20 years old, broke the defense of the PSV.
He received medical care for nine minutes on the ground and needed oxygen before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: “It has a double fracture at its feet and is in the hospital and
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe tomorrow and then he'll be operated in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who came to Manchester United when he was 18, encounters difficulties, then plays fantastic and now something happens.
In the locker room, his oxygen mask was put on.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but at double fracture the break is six months and won't play in the group phase.
I hope he can play this season again.
It seems that Moreno was lucky and escaped the red carton and the concession of a punishment blow.
Arbiter Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish Mexican.
Van Gaal suggested the Italian officer was wrong.
You can judge yourself when they say it's fault and red cardboard.
It was a very ugly intervention, with two legs.
A message on Shaw's Twitter account: “Thank you all for messages, I have no words to express how weak I feel, I start on the way to recovery, I will become stronger and
Similar news: Manchester United hit by Luke Shaw's accident in defeat from the PSV
The England team's Foundation has an additional reason to recover to play at the European Championship in France next June.
Phillip Cocu, PSV coach, said: “It’s a very bad accident.
Everyone is very sad when a player suffers such an accident.
Our players never aim to accident an opponent.
Moreno broke his leg playing for Mexico's national against the Dutch national led by Van Gaal at the 2014 World Championship.
\"It's very hard because he didn't intend to hurt his opponent, and when you hear it's a very serious accident, it's not good and he said Cocu.
I didn't see the phase.
I could only see the ball heading in another direction, so it seemed that [Moreno] had touched it but I couldn't see the intervention on Luke.
In the statement for SBS6, Moreno said: “I know what it is, and how difficult it is to get through something.
I feel so bad, I'm so sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado also arrived at the hospital after an intervention by Chris Smalling.
Adam Lyth has clearly risked England's omission but still holds itself strong
Victoria v. Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, however, after seeing the team selected by England for the tournament, I do not take into account a repetition of defeat with 3-0 in the test matches.
I wouldn't eliminate any variant of a moving victory.
Perhaps Alastair Cook's team has less experience than three years ago but has good spin players in the beating line and collective morale is strong; they will not be marked by the 2012 events but will have a tender positive attitude.
Moeen Ali evolves as a spinner and Adil Rashid, even though it is unknown at the test level, is an option for attack.
Similar subjects: Adam Lyth left the England team for the test matches and was replaced by Alex Hales
Clearly, as his principal coach in Yorkshire, I find it difficult to analyze the decision not to select Adam Lyth on the team.
He played the seven games against two good attackers, in difficult conditions, and the reality simple but tough is that cricket players are judged after results.
There were no signs of questions related to Joe Root, for example, until the announcements were made because - and I said that before - the players are their own selections.
Some fifty years and maybe Lyth would have extended his run but his destiny is in his hands.
I hope if he makes more runs for Yorkshire he'll have other opportunities.
The main coach of the England team, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude even when his performance was not to the extent of his ability and does not surprise me; first of all, he is a team man.
It is hard to answer the question as long as a batsman is noticed in the test matches.
Lyth had seven runs - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton had nine.
Only Compton got lucky at home and moving.
The only discontent you could have was that England preferred Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean tournament - when Lyth was in full shape - but that missed occasion is the past.
There's Alex Hales on the team, a batsman I'm very fond of.
He's a cricket player who has the X-factor and I noticed early in Yorkshire this season when he scored 236 against us at a Trent Bridge pitch.
It should be given at least the same opportunity as those before it, but this will depend, of course, on the composition of the team in the UAE.
The idea was launched that Moeen would open up next to Cook, which would lead to extra spinner keeping at the same time four quicks, and I have nothing against it.
I don't see why a thrower couldn't hit there and this left player already proved he's fucked up.
Maybe Moeen didn't bring success to his district, Worcestershire, but it was no. 3 for them, so the difference isn't great.
My old teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 test matches 38 as first drop before he entered open in 2001.
It immediately wiped out three centuries and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the team on the back-up spinner post and, although I had limited contact with him, he struck me that he is a very impressive young man.
People could judge his fraged age - with an average of 31 at battling 35 at the ball - and they might think it's point, but there's not a lot of spinners and the selections have opted for the youth.
You'll learn a lot from this tournament.
England has brought some changes to the coach team as well.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, a batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the test matches could be a master hit.
It is one of the best players and will bring a lot of experience, since it has played in any situation and against all types of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white-ball league of the tournament and will bring both energy and unscrupulous ambitions.
I always thought he was born to get involved in the international cricket, either as a player or as a coach, and so does Mahela.
Sometimes, new voices in the locker room, even if it transmits messages that have been transmitted before, can bring fresh air into the team.
Colly Durham's teammate, Ben Stokes rests for one-day matches, Root got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with this.
Although they do not all agree, the coaches and the selections do not make the program.
And you have to hold on, the players' jobs depend on the results they get.
Such decisions are never easy.
The Brexit camp could also have a cause if the economy remained calm until 2017.
As it happens, David Cameron's renegotiation strategy to maintain Britain in the EU is becoming increasingly confused, even without the choice of the genius Jeremy-Da or Corbyn to lead the Labour Party or TUC brings serious criticisms of Europe on Tuesday.
The foreigners have her characters like Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
One European diplomat explained last days that - sunk in crises similar to that in the EU - not all being provoked internally - some Member States are fuelled by the UK's agenda for concessions and changes to the treaties, most of which they do not want.
In Brighton, on the occasion of the annual meeting, TUC decided that they do not want this if they erode social protection.
We could even call it Dave and George's birthday book.
The first minister and the chancellor attends bilateral meetings or summits in foreign capital, takes a picture in front of a famous local monument, with or without the local representative, and then returns home and declares that they won the alliance for reform.
It's just about me.
My European friend, who wants a Great Britain with an external perspective under the EU's roof - \"Don't leave us alone with France and declare Berlin - suggests that fewer ministers and officials obtained from certain capitals have come to the point where they don't care if they stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, the highly cautious German chancellor, is an ally but has been in charge for 10 years and wants to leave position before her situation bursts, as happened with Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16), who stayed too long.
In 2017, the President of France, François Hollande, will be re-elected or replaced.
And his power is in decline.
Poland could soon have a right-wing nationalist government, Spain one left.
It is hard to believe that they will help the English people who take pictures, whose energy would be better used to prevent Scotland from leaving Britain - something they do not want either because most have similar separatist tendencies.
Thus, some ministers might even plan to make intentional remarks that do not help, in the SNP style, in the 2017 UK referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suggests.
‘Renegotiation has been fixed and — and the United Kingdom has not obtained anything of value from the renegotiation —
Europeans and their skins as capacitors can be Fleet Street and how skeptics are the barons of the oligarchic press looking at the EU with skepticism, because they did not participate in the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn who ratified our 1973 entry in 2:1 report.
Maybe I miss Boris Johnson, the euro-opportunist, who became famous in the early 1990s when he was a correspondent in Brussels.
Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included mixing the bag and tax payers, foreigners who cheated telephones and pseudo non-domestics that hold most of the important newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair saw them the same way he realized that when you're locked in a cage next to an angry gorilla, you have to give him the bananas to distract him from the thought of eating you at lunch and again at tea.
Miliband was, in fact, more Blairite than Blair in opposition to Cameron's idea of referendum, given that Blair made a concession on the principle of the abandoned EU constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which gave him an exit card.
The press didn't forgive him for that either.
But Jeremy Corbyn, who touched my friend and on Mondays at Westminster - I told him to stop spending his time with me - seems to be in danger of adopting Neil Kinnock's boycott strategy of the 1980s, a mistake then and now.
It may take time, however, to develop a coherent media cooperation strategy, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose position at the BBC left a vacancy on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position in Europe is what I would call indulgence and evolution.
He says he would like us to stay in a reformed EU.
Most of those who disagree with \"anglicism\" and \"preservers\" might agree with that.
That said Hilary and A Benn, but not a Benn and Benn on radio and TV this week, when the researcher in him struggled not to recognize that John McDonnell's appointment by Corbyn as a shadow minister on financial issues was a bad idea.
He reminded me of the 70s when his father fought on TV to be disloyal to his fellow labs, without going too far and without losing his function in the cabinet.
Hilary's fight was more attractive.
But the struggle to stay awake in any situation and - Benn's expression - does not match what McDonnell said and what JC said to colleagues and parliamentarians during the private meeting of Monday night.
No matter how much Corbyn wants to convey - he kept me aware of myself - the discipline of messages remains important in the era of television and especially in the age of social networks, a focus of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right not to grant Cameron a favor ticket in Europe, allowing him to take good support of the labs in the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly believes this.
But McDonnell’s and Corbê’s basic sophistication of EU membership - in line with their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just an esoteric discussion among the left-wing dissenters, for which the narcissism of small differences is a central dogma.
As in his NATO sophism - Tom Watson is reluctant that JC will not campaign for resignation - foreign diplomats will be forced to try to understand.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - and there are suspicious voters - for the concessions and the UK when everything could be useless?
The US is already quite disappointed at the poor military performance of the English in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a conservative government cutting costs, as I was reminded at the launch of the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Experts criticise the decision of the Department of Public Health in England on electronic cigarettes
According to researchers, claims by a government agency that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting between 12 people, some of them connected in tobacco industry.
Specialists from the editorial team of the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet's publication in criticizing the evidence used by the Department of Public Health in England (PHE) in his report on electronic cigarettes.
PHE published the reference report last month and described it as a complex analysis of the evidence and
However, a number of researchers questioned the robustness of data and pointed to links between certain experts and tobacco industry.
An article published last month in medical magazine Lancet attacked the extraordinary fragile base and which PHE founded its main conclusion.
Two other researchers who write in the BMJ have questioned their claims and grounding them on solid soil or on moving sand and
Martin McKee, European public health professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at Liverpool University, said: “A fundamental principle of public health is that policies must be based on evidence of effectiveness and
They claimed that PHE claims that the current estimates show that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking and are based on a detailed analysis of evidence and models.
In fact, a single meeting attended by 12 people led to the development of a multi-criteria decision analysis model (MCDA) that synthesized their views on the negative effects associated with different products containing nicotine; the results of this meeting were presented briefly in a research work.
McKee and Capewell said that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, about which the executive director was said to have received in the past funding from British American Tobacco for conducting an independent study.
It also validated BAT accreditation in public health in a sustainability report, he said.
They added that one of the 12 participants at the meeting declared the funding received from an electronic cigarettes manufacturer but did not know the funding that there are reports that they would have received it from the tobacco-producing company Philip Morris International.
No arguments have been provided on the basis of which panel members have been selected, but among them there are a few meetings and acquaintances in the production of electronic cigarettes, some of which even claim to be in the work of the industry.
Other meeting participants are not known for tobacco control expertise.
The head of the tobacco control section in the PHE also participated in the meeting.
The research work developed by the group makes it convincingly and that they lack solid evidence of the harmful effect that most products have according to the majority of the criteria and said McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these links or limitations are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell have stated that PHE claims that currently there is no evidence that electronic cigarettes are a factor that encourages smoking among children or non-smokers and are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of the PHE health department, says that he has responded to BMJ claims in the past.
He said: \"Electronic hunting is significantly less harmful than smoking and
One of two people who've smoked all their lives because of this vice.
All evidence suggests that the risk posed by electronic health cigarettes is less comparative, but we need to continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about the information it receives and the information that is not obtained from evidence, given in particular the high degree of public confusion regarding the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Annually, about 80,000 people lose their lives due to a smoking-related disease and the annual costs of the national health system due to smoking reach 2 billion pounds.
While the use of electronic cigarettes is not without risk, they only show a fraction of the harmful effect of smoking - we fulfill our national duty.

But a separate campaign also led to the display of a large number of posters in bus stations and subway stations that need a second look.

According to Gavin Grindon, curator Cruel Designs and lecturer at Essex University, artists are increasingly asking questions and seeking to make political works accessible to the public outside the gallery.
Many artists are going to collaborate with activities and protest movements, realizing that they have to go out into the real world for their art to have an impact on society.

The film made by Amnesty had over 100,000 views on Facebook in 24 hours and was created by the advertising agency VCP that worked pro bono, and the graphic designer and the artist who doubled the voice also worked for free.
The creation director of the VCCP, Matt Lever, was shocked by the silence around the arms fair advertising - with an empty space in the ExCel calendar - and thought, \"Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid.\"
They played with the realization of a more realistic ad itself by enriching it with strong animations and colors, it was more absorbing and

Eight golden rules to live in the home

Violunist David Grimal: In Bach's time there were no world tournaments.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people who worked, artists and non-commercial representatives.
French violinist David Grimal is one of the great artists of our times, known not only as a soloist but also as the initiator of a less ordinary project, by right and according to what he himself says, Les Dissonances - an orchestra made up of international soloists and talented musicians, who interpret a symphony repertoire without having a conductor, and this makes it a curiosity in the classical musical landscape.
Les Dissonances was this year at the Enescu Festival with two performances: a performance on Sunday, where the solist was David Grimal, the orchestra founder, and one month, when in the foreground was the cellist Xavier Phillips, the works composed of Enescu being unwieldy.
Both performances, performed on the scene of Athens, showed the public another way to play classical music.
Les Dissonances appeared on the music scene in 2004 as the only classical musical ensemble in which there is no conductor at the time.
The conductor is the most important musician for musicians.
It is true, on the one hand, the musicians need an education either to become soloists or to become interpreters in an orchestra - speaking of instrumentalists, and not composers.
They are formed as specialized tellers
They feel like they need a conductor.
On the other side of the scene, for the public, all musical fetishization focuses on the conductor.
And so, business, music industry, makes marketing.
So we're not talking about music anymore.
So, if we look at this world, we have on the one hand skilled workers, which is stupid, and an audience that can't listen, but you have to look at, which again is stupid and considers David Grimal.
The violinist tells that this change in the way he makes music came after the music and his soloist career.
I was like a high-level athlete who had to do the same exercise in the whole world with different orchestras, to earn lots of money and to bring money and the music industry.
Ten years ago, when I was about 30 years old, I found this very depressing, because I no longer found human creativity and brotherhood in this system.
So, I haven't found any sense to continue on this road.
So I decided to create Les Dissonances.
This happened in 2004, and at that time no one did such things without a drive: “The musical world, extremely conservative, did not want such projects and
“How do I imagine you’re marketing with a collective of musicians where there’s no more selfishness and the artist’s question.
David Grimal acknowledges that Les Dissonaces represents a luxury and specifying that none of the musicians who are part of the orchestra depends on the success of this project to live.
In 10 years of the ensemble's existence, the lack of a conductor did not prove to be a milestone in the musical act: “In a curious way, the more complex we sang a repertoire, the easier it seems, because all the musicians are forced to be present in the operation not only in the role and supports Grimal, adding that at Sunday show we had 74 conductors on the stage and
In Grimal's opinion, the Enescu Festival is a very brave and just because it invited Les Dissonances: “An extraordinary festival, where are present the largest orchestras in the world that you sing 3 times a day, and in the midst of these orchestras you invited this strange group and
In a temple of orchestral tradition, such as the Enescu Festival, there is the place and interest for something different, which breaks barriers.
Speaking about Enescu's work, the violinist acknowledges that he feels the Romanian music of the famous Roman composer, so that he did not need a special approach when he introduced works by Enescu into the repertoire or.
Grimal notes that Enescu's music is very instinctive, but that's what happens when we talk about George Enescu and Romanian music, because there is a George Enescu who made French music and
Grimal militarizes for the change in the way classical music education is done, considering that the musician's mess, as is organized today, has a death seat and and as the musician represents the music itself
We don't need to take the world tour five times a year if it doesn't serve anything.
In Bach's time there were no world tournaments.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people who worked, who were artists and not commercial representatives.
For me, the organization of concerts, festivals, tournaments, the release of albums, all are formidable, extraordinary, but as long as they are done in the music service.
If we don't, we're in a system where creativity is suffering, it's no longer free.
To illustrate this, David Grimal gave examples of Romanian products before and after accession to the European Union: “In Romania, before entering the EU, you had good vegetables and meat and
In order to enter the EU, it was necessary to adopt health laws that are not good for vegetables and meat.
Product and agriculture reach the service of supermarkets, as is the case in France.
With music happening the same thing, it's the same logic.
Les Dissonances makes reds maybe not very beautiful, but when we cut them are real reds.
In an ideal world, this music should return to the center and like the institutions and industries that manage this system to understand that music does not need to be sold, but needs to be shared, and this can be done starting with educational policy.
\"If we consider - as Koreans, Chinese, Japanese - that Western music is one of the most beautiful things of humanity, we reintroduce his learning in school, reintroduce the concerts on television and through this education we would no longer need to sell musical by-products and believe Grimal.
Certainly, there are things in classical music education that remain very communist, this everywhere, is something very militarized.
It depends on this discipline if we compare a musician to a soldier, or if we form a musician who will sing to an instrument, being, above all, a musician.
We're talking about a completely different education, if we want to form a soldier (this education - n.red.) must be somehow, if we want to form a musician, it's completely different.
After your opinion, what is more dangerous, a soldier or a musician, asked the French artist smiling.
Grimal shows that, for artists, the reward of another kind of making music comes just from overcoming this status of soldiers and overcoming what I know are their limits and: \"Musicians discover at a certain time that they are not soldiers, and that's why after the concert they come out of the chambers and
David Grimal spoke about the project or music and about his vision of music and the artist in the “Festival of the Ideas and a discussion with the public organized at the International George Enescu Festival by the Aspen Institute Romania.

Cinema City is looking for the Little Voices of the United States
Cinema City launches the most challenging challenge for children: double two characters from the super-production and “Craiasa Zăpezii 3D”
Do you have a super-talented and spontaneous child who likes movies?
Give him the chance to get to the star.
In September, in the most recent campaigns dedicated to enthusiastic and ambitious children, wishing to reach future stars and who are between 8 and 16 years old, Cinema City is looking for the Little Voices Mari and giving them an extraordinary opportunity to double two characters from a famous animated film.
If in classic drawings the emphasis was placed on the approach of the voice of the actor by the character's specific animated character, in the last period, the creation of the story is also taken into account those who are going to interpret the voices, and they are usually well-known actors.
Cinema City Romania, however, wants to discover new voices and that is why we are starting an unprecedented campaign.
We want to find the right voice and challenge parents to enroll their children in our contest.
They'll have a special experience, because the characters are nice and the lines are funny.
\"The kids will have fun and have a real chance to be part of an actor team and said Ionascu, Marketing Manager of Cinema City Romania.
In the first stage of the competition, from September 11th to September 30th, Cinema City organizes a preselection following which will be 10 children (five girls and five boys) who will have the opportunity to give a sample in a recording studio with professionals.
All parents have to do is access the smallvociari.cinema-city.ro platform, where to enroll the child in the contest and prepare him for the voice test.
Next, you have to choose one of the four films available on the platform, download the texts that the child is going to read, and then, the child will register by interpreting their own version of double.
Four films about friendship, heroes of bass, magic and hope can choose competitors to support the challenge: “Pene Galbene 3D and “Monte: Guardian of the 3D Moon and “Blinky Bill: Koala the 3D wells and “Albinu and Maya 3D”
In the end, the most talented two children (a girl and a boy) will see their dream fulfilled and double a character in the super-produced \"The Snow Queen - Craiasa Zăpezii 3D and who will take the lead in Romania in November of this year.
FedEx wins are mixed, tax forecasts fall for 2016
FedEx said disappointing results for the last quarter, the delivery giant reducing profit estimates for the whole year as a result of low demand for transport services and increased costs for its land transport division.
The company also stated that it intends to employ around 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
At the same time last year, FedEx announced that it would employ 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
The company’s actions decreased by approximately 2.5% in pre-market trading, 45 minutes before the bell opening sound on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. stated that it is expected to hold between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending in May of the next year, with 20 cents less, according to a previous estimate.
Analysis pre-sounds $10.84, according to a survey conducted by FactSet.
The decreasing estimate comes despite the rising prices of 4.9% on average, with the entry into force on 4 January and the higher overtaxes for the transport of large or large packages, to be applied in November.
The company stated that it is still waiting for the gains and the previous year as a result of the reduction of costs, higher revenues and the development of online trade.
President and Director-General Fred Smith said that he said he was facing a considerably weaker economic situation than was envisaged, particularly in terms of global production and trade and
The employee plans during the holidays were announced one day after the UPS competitor said he intends to hire 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, about the number of commitments he made last year.
In the quarter that ended on August 31, FedEx won $692 million, 6% more than the previous year.
Winning by action was $2.42, under the average estimate of $2.44 per action by 12 analysts who responded to the survey conducted by Zacks Investment Research.
The profit grew by 5%, up to $12.3 billion.
Six analyses that participated in the survey conducted by Zacks estimated the amount of $12.23 billion.
The FedEx company has been hit in recent years by a decline in international priority transport, leading to the stagnation of revenues registered by its Express unit.
But the explosion in online shopping has jumped the results of the FedEx Ground division.
In the last quarter, the revenues of the round division increased by 29%, but operational revenues practically stagnated due to higher costs for large packages and own insurance.
The express unit recorded an increase in revenues due to higher base rates, while revenues recorded by the Freight division decreased due to costs in the city.
At the pre-market transaction, about an hour before the opening sound, the FedEx shares dropped by $3.85 or 2.5% at $150.15.
Tuesday at the closing time decreased by 11% at the year level and by 17% compared to the record maximum recorded on 11 June.
At the most expected meetings in recent years, policy makers in the Federal Reserve will spend two days this week around a 27-foot Honduran mahon meal to decide whether it was time to raise a key interest rate for the first time in almost a decade.
Above them, at the end of the Central Bank's meeting room, a mural painting of the United States will be crossed.
The map is meant to recall that Janet L. Yellen, President Fed, and his colleagues must put the economic interests of the nation above all.
The Central Bank has received a double task from Congress: maximizing the employment rate in the US and maintaining price stability.
But since the great economic crisis, the Fed leaders have confirmed that there is a third unwritten task: financial stability.
And this third task could be factor X in a decision too difficult to anticipate, which will be announced on Tuesday, and which will determine whether the US economy is prepared to be debated by the unprecedented incentive offered by the short-term interest rate almost zero in force from the end of 2008.
Even if most data indicate a strong economy, the recent turmoil in global financial markets could scare Fed officials already cautiously and add volatility by increasing the reference rate to federal funds - even with only a quarter of a percentage point.
“Evidently, the labour market and inflation will be the first and most important aspects to follow and said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at the brokering firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
‘But I believe that if they were looking for an excuse not to increase the interest rate, the uncertainty in the global market is sufficient to give them arguments to wait and say it.
There is no consensus as to the decision that Fed will make, in itself causing instability in the financial market.
About half of Bloomberg’s recent savings have anticipated an increase in interest rates this week.
But financial markets expect Fed to postpone, a key indicator showing that the probability of safety is only 30%.
This would indicate a fall on the stock market if Fed increased the interest rate, except where policy makers would mitigate the impact by promising that it would pass a long time to the next growth.
Tuesday, industrial media Dow Jones climbed 228,89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599,85.
The Avant was triggered by expectations that the Fed decision factors will maintain the stable interest rate this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
\"It would be surprising that Fed would grow the interest rate at this time and said Lonski.
If Fed decision-makers would do this, they should act in depth in their policies to avoid panic on financial markets and
Other experts have said that an increase in interest rate would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertainty related to the moment Fed acts.
Just a month ago, Fed appeared to be about to increase the rate by 0.25% this month, the first small step towards slow recovery of monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of the US recovery.
Yellen said in spring and early summer that he expected an increase in the interest rate this year despite the high objections of liberals such as needing more economic progress.
Although job creation slowed down in August, the growth of the labour market was solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years and near the Fed level as total employment.
Wage gains have shown signs of safety.
Although inflation continued to fail to reach the annual target of the central bank, the Fed decision-makers stated that a key reason was the temporary effect of the declining oil prices.
The economy can do higher rates and needs them, given the tension on the labour market and said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But global financial markets began to enter fibrillation at the end of this month, after China devalued its currency.
Dow Jones industrial media has dropped by 16% below the record peak reached in May, as investors have feared that slowing down the Chinese economy will pull down the global growth.
The market has declined somewhat this month, the Dow index is now about 10% below the maximum in May.
For Fed decision factors, the market agitation is added to the complex calculation of the interest rate growth time.
“No matter what happened in the financial markets and the news about the weakening of the Chinese economy in recent weeks, they would be more secure at the meeting and said Stephen D. Oliner, experienced researcher at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and was officially Fed.
Now, he predicts they will wait at least a month to better manage the effects.
“There is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the US economy and they have almost no data to build on later events in China and Oliner said.
The welfare of the global economy is not one of the major interests of the Fed, and it should not be taken into account in making decisions.
But, in reality, Fed has become the world's monetary authority.
In recent years, the influence of the central bank has been enormous.
In 2013, Ben S. Bernanke, the president's simple allusion that Fed could taste and the monetary expansion triggered a earthquake on world markets.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly mixed up, Fed officials are expected not only to monitor progress in other areas, but also to consult with other central banks and experts to better interpret the world economy.
His decision-making process is much more art than science and said Zachary Karabell, the head of the global strategy department of Investnet Inc.
Jeffrey Laker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., said this month that \"Fed has a history of over-dimensional reaction to changes in the financial market that appear to be unrelated to economic bases and
Laker, a member of the Federal Open Market Commission, a decision-making body, which supported the growth of the interest rate, provided for example the 1998-99 decisions.
A financial crisis that affected Asia led the Fed to reduce the reference rate by 0.75% in three meetings, despite the potential implications of limited identification for U.S. development and Laker said.
A year later, Fed officials came back to their deaths.
Fed should address the issue of financial stability in the first place only in the face of a major crisis, such as the 2008 market earthquake, said Adam S. Posen, a member of the Bank of England's interest rate committee.
The last turbulent period did not rise at that level at all, he said.
“We certainly don’t want to be in a position to fear an increase in interest rates because the markets have been upset, and said Posen, President Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still holds the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until something is changed in this regard, I do not think that it should take any early action.

Seven's Sunrise dominates the polls, despite the attempts of the Nine Canal to transmit to Today Show about the change of leadership of the party
The urgent movement of Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to convey the consequences of the changes to the leadership of the Liberal Party did not bring a significant increase in the audience for Today.
The early Nine Canal broadcast from the capital after Tony Abbott's defeat in front of Malcolm Turnbull.
Sunrise, moderated by David Koch and Samantha Armitage, was caught in London as part of a series of broadcasts conducted over a few weeks, including Dubai, New York, Cascade Niagara and Cancun.
This ‘cruzim’ and distance did not seem to count too much for the viewers Aussie TV, Sunrise having an audience of 397,000 viewers in the five cities of the capital, and Today with 339,000.
Today recorded a slight increase compared to the hearings of Monday (317,000) and Tuesday (283,000) but the figures were smaller than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has reduced Sunrise's difference in recent months.
In August, Today had an average hearing of 318,000 and Sunrise of 330,000.

4 people lost their lives after the police shot rubber bullets at protestors in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police shot rubber bullets in the same way as demonstrating against the new proposed constitution of the country, an officer said Wednesday.
Violence occurred on Tuesday night in Rupandehi district, about 280 km west of Kathmandu capital.
According to statements by Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the head of the district police, over 1,000 protesters gathered in front of a police station, and some of them threw stones and molotov cocktails.
Mr. Dhakal said that police forces used tear gas after shooting fires in the air before resorting to the use of rubber bullets.
According to his statement, twenty police officers and five civilians were injured.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known to kill but are usually used as an alternative less lethal, have caused so many deaths.
The clash was the last event after weeks of violent protests in the southern region of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group claim that the new provinces established on the basis of the new constitution would dilute their political influence.
Protests also existed in western Nepal, where the ethnic group Tharus wanted its own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, were killed in violent clashes on 10 August,
when four important political parties signed an agreement for the division of the country into the province - a major step towards a new constitution but an extremely controversial problem in Nepal, a central government for hundreds of years.
The process of drafting a new constitution was launched in 2008, but the lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands in April.
This week, in Kathmandu, the legislators voted on the clauses in the draft constitution and the officials said the new card could be adopted on Sunday.

Weight reduction surgery and could be useful in the case of diabetes patients with mild obesity
The benefits of weight reduction surgery for people with mild obesity, with type 2 diabetes, could be maintained for at least five years, according to a new study.
It's still premature to tell if diabetes patients with mild obesity live longer after weight loss surgery than those who follow nonsurgical treatments.
“It takes a long time to centralize mortality data and said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a specialist in obesity surgery, because she wrote an article about the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Operations for weight loss, called bariatric surgery, use different methods to reduce the stomach.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.
Over the years bariatric surgery has proven effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted on people with morbid obesity, with a body mass index (BMI) 35 or higher.
BMI, a weight measurement unit in relation to height, is considered normal in range 18.5-24.9.
The BMI value of at least 25 indicates that one person is overweight and people with BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate the BMI by accessing: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers at the General Min-Sheng Hospital in Taiwan used the data collected after 2007 in a trial comparing two types of bariatric surgery - bypass gastrectomy and gastrectomy in the mansion - in the medical treatment of type 2 diabetes in people with mild obesity.
Mean BMI in people who underwent surgery decreased from 31 to 24.5 until the end of the fifth year in the study.
In the meantime, BMI in people who received non-surgical treatment against diabetes remains almost the same level, i.e. 29.
Among those who have experienced surgery, diabetes has completely cured 36% and partially at 28%.
In the group treated by medical methods, by comparison, diabetes was completely cured to only 1% and partial to just 2% of subjects.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides and LDL cholesterol control were generally better in the surgical group and concluded the authors.
Researchers also monitored the blood level of A1c haemoglobin, which reflects the level of blood glucose over time.
Researchers write that the optimal level of A1c haemoglobin is below 7%.
Following surgery, mean haemoglobin A1c decreased from approximately 9% to approximately 6%.
However, in the group treated by medical methods, approximately 8% remained.
But this \"glycemic and improved control - reflected by improved haemoglobin levels A1c - did not reduce the mortality rate to five years, according to Chief Researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results associated with the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, compared to the group with gastrectomy in the manson, the surgical bypass intervention group lost more weight (18.7 and 14.2 kg), recorded more considerable decreases in BMI (7.4 and 5.1) and A1c (3.1% and 2.1%) and showed a higher likelihood of complete remission of diabetes (46.9% and 16.7%).
Although the new study does not indicate a benefit in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a high-weight study in Sweden that surgery prolongs life, says Blackstone, University of Arizona, Faculty of Medicine - Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese people who suffered from bariatric surgery had a probability of approximately 29% less likely to die after 15 years, compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not indicate a benefit in survival to patients who underwent surgery, Blackstone said it is an optimistic aspect for people with BMI below 35 interest in the procedure.
“This is the point where this work is critical because it states that this surgery is safe in the lower BMI group and without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease, she says.
Blackstone added that patients and their doctors should start taking the weight seriously then the patient's BMI reaches 27-30.
“I think we are waiting too long until we encourage people to take this matter seriously and she said.
I think that once they've accumulated these genetic changes that short-circuited their bodies by predisposing them to obesity and diabetes, it's extremely hard to get back to normal.
“It’s impossible for everyone to come to Europe and - Dalai Lama - RT news
Europe could not all receive refugees, Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader sent a call to put an end to violence in refugee countries.
Dalai Lama spoke about the current refugee crisis problem in his speech at the opening of the Oxford Dalai Lama Center for Compassion, dedicated to ethics studies, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to Britain.
He said that, in the present situation, the interests of humanity should prevail in front of the interests of every nation and even of every continent.
He also stressed that, while admirable, the response of countries in western Europe to the refugee crisis is inadequate.
“It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe and he said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria's efforts to cope with the crisis, he stressed that it is only a temporary solution.
“It’s great care for a few thousand refugees, but we need to think at the same time about long-term solutions to bring true peace and development, especially through education, in Muslim countries and stressed it.
Basically, we need to think about ways to reduce crime in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The force never solved these problems and he added.
Referring to the problem of violence, Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions following the September 11 terrorist attacks, stating that the US violent response generated a chain of uncontrollable events.
After the events of 11 September, I sent condolence in a letter to President Bush and told him to solve this problem without appealing to violence.
I know his reasons were strong but he used force and generated unexpected consequences and said Dalai Lama.
Four-fold increase in the number of children who have ingested detergent of hands in the last 4 years
According to the Georgia Anti-Operating Centre, U.S. anti-Operating centers reported an increase of approximately 400% since 2010 in the number of children under 12 years of age who swallowed hand detergents with a high alcohol content.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, the director of the Georgia Anti-Operating Centre, cases of hand detergent injection in children under 12 years of age from 3.266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
“The children have more frequent access to these products and unfortunately a percentage of them reach the emergency room and Lopez told CNN.
Lopez said some children drink intentionally detergent and others do it to impress their friends or to respond to challenges on social networks.
On YouTube you can watch movies showing teenagers how to drink detergent to create cheap drinks.
It seems that adolescents have mixed the detergent with drinking water to get a stronger drink.
Smaller children can be attracted to the attractive smell of detergent.
\"A child doesn't think he's hurting them, and Lopez says.
Many of the most attractive types (hand detergent) are scented ones.
Detergents of hand with aroma of strawberry, grapefruit, orange are the most attractive for children.
The hand detergent contains approximately 45-95% alcohol.
Especially in young children, only a few swallows can cause alcohol poisoning.
“It’s very concentrated alcohol and said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the anti-absorbing center at the University Hospital in Kansas, for the Fox 4 channel in Kansas City.
Thus, we avoid leaving a glass of whiskey on the table, but people leave these detergents of hands in accessible places and if the little ones reach them, this is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who has recently ingested the equivalent of four sprays with straw-flavored hand detergent, has arrived at the emergency room to receive treatment.
He had alcohol179, twice as high as the threshold at which an adult is considered by law under the influence of alcohol, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, a physician in the emergency room who treated her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah was in trouble and couldn't go when he arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children's hospital to identify signs of brain injury, because the girl fell and hit her head because of alcohol, Ritchey said.
\"It was scary and Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, told CNN.
It could have been fatal.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use alcohol-free wet products or wets and keep their hands off children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some detergents were associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing detergent hands that contained an undeclared, toxic ingredient.
The health authorities assumed that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not alcohol, specified as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-class students from North New York plotted to poison their teacher and put antibacterial products in class and according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to hand detergent and prohibited him in his course room.
The police considered that the plan was not meant and raised the disciplinary issue of the school inspectorate.

Griffiths dismantles the rumors related to misunderstandings
There have been rumors of misunderstandings in Celtic, deposed by Griffiths, who insisted that he and his team should not be subjected to increased pressure given that they are preparing to face the leaders of the Dutch League.
I don't think we're feeling the pressure, I think the players are just waiting.
Absence of Scots in the race for title bores the Dutch - de Boer
Former middle-aged Rangers and former Dutch international player Ronald de Boer said Dutch football supporters lost interest in Celtic - because they didn't fight for the title with Rangers.
De Boer, currently Ambassador of Ajax, said: “In the Netherlands no longer transmits the summary of the Celtic games; why so
Because there's not Rangers in there.
Here, it's not just about returning the Rangers.
He's talking about Old Firm.
It's talking about both teams together and there it's heading for interest.
Voltage is high in the Old Firm games and not just the Scots want to see these games.
I'll change the situation, promise Dela.
RONNY Deila agreed that Celtic fought out of its own strength, the Norwegian chief promised to change the situation.
The defeat with Malmo and the subsequent elimination of the Champions League were followed by defeat in front of Aberdeen who played in 10 people, now in the top of the ranking with a five point advance.
Yet, Delila said: “Celtic has had periods before and will return.
We want to get out of this situation as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and so many people are extremely angry or sad about what's happening.
We feel the same way - but we have to move on.
We don't necessarily need the support of Celtics because so and so players get better.
It's extremely important to stay united now.
Warburton's Prudence on January Transfers
Despite the comments of just a few weeks ago suggesting that he would have identified some objectives for the transfers of January, the leader of Rangers, Mark Warburton is cautious when it comes to transfers, insisting that he does not want to affect the Ibrox team unit.
Former Head of Brentford said: \"January transfer period is very different from summer time.
In the case of players transferring the summer, there is a period before the season in which they can be integrated, which you could observe in this season in our group.
The team is doing very well.
Sometimes you do more harm if you bring players that aren't necessary.
Celtic targets Michu after withdrawal
Swansea Striker, Michu, associated with Celtic during the transfer period, suggested that it could be withdrawn after the expiration of the contract with Swans.
The 29-year-old player fought two years with problems at his ankle and failed to leave the country of Wales in the summer.
Hearts confronted with SFA regarding Neilson's comments
Hearts drove with 2-1 when Paterson was removed and lost with 3-2, but the red card of the foundation was then cancelled - the third red card cancelled in eight months.
Neilson maintains his statements, insisting: “I didn’t question integrity, I didn’t comment on performance.
Griffiths swears to avoid Tynecastle
The invincible Hibee was taken for granted that he sang a song with insulting lyrics about the former Hearts player, Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in March 2014 in a pub in the Roseburn region of Edinburgh before a derby with Edinburgh at Tynecastle.
“It was derby and it was the excitement of the moment, and said the stripper, adding: “There’s no need to say that I don’t go back to Tynecastle except if I play for Celtic and

McInnes is happy for the dirtyvictory and against Hamilton
Derek McInnes acknowledges that Aberdeen's team must desperately cling to Hamilton Accies to get the seventh successive victory in the league, which has brought five points to them in front of Celtic due to the first shot of Adam Rooney's first shot.
McInnes said: “There is no team that has won anything in the cup or league, and that has not won the matches and
The unemployment rate in Scotland remains unchanged while growth in Britain
THE SON'S RATE in Scotland remains unchanged, with 164,000 in the period of July, while the number of the British total increased by 10,000, reaching 1.82 million in the same period.
The 5.9% unemployment rate in Scotland was higher than in the United Kingdom, 5.5% according to the figures presented by the National Statistical Office (Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Meanwhile, the employment rate in Scotland decreased by 12,000 over three months, the number of employees currently being 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland decreased in that quarter to 74% - a figure above the average of 73.5 in the United Kingdom.
Scottish State Secretary David Mundell, commenting on the latest figures, said: “The long-term plan of the authorities has laid the foundations for a stronger economy and
It's been almost a year since Scotland made its historic decision to remain a part of the United Kingdom.
Over these 12 months, I have observed improvements in the labour market in Scotland, the employment rate and the rate of unemployment decrease.
Why I'm a witness to an execution in Oklahoma
During today, except for a late legal intervention, I will see how a man is sentenced to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll sit in a room for observers in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary's execution room and see how Richard Glossip is executed by administering the lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
The invitation came first in January, through his best friend, and, although I was shocked, I accepted.
As the day approaches because of the reason, I am terrified of the idea.
So, why do I do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story of capital punishment.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true, journalists can be witnesses to execution in America and, because applications usually exceed the number of places available, there is a macabre lottery to decide who will be chosen.
Oklahoma reduced the number of reserved seats for press representatives from 12 to five.
The others will watch execution impartially.
I can't do that.
I would stay next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, plus I developed my own connection to him over the months of telephone conversations and a visit that lasted two-half hours.
I like the guy.
We often laugh when we talk.
Prison authorities say they can't be witnesses and journalists, so I won't be allowed to have a notebook and a pen to notice what I see.
I'll have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story as he wants it, get access.
I cried at her.
He acknowledged that he could have formulated better, but he still feels that I am wrong.
Richard Glossip disagreed with some of the things I said and wrote them down.
Don't tell me what to write and I wouldn't do it even if I'd ask.
I told him he could get me off the witness list anytime.
But you want an international report to be made on the subject.
He thinks that if he dies, advertising will help move against capital punishment.
Kim Bellware, reporter at Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to find out more about the case, listen to the multimedia file series I made.
I won't come back here on all the details.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry Van Treese's murder make him guilty of complicity.
But I think he's very likely not to be guilty of murder.
I believe that there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
And I'll watch him die from this perspective.
I can't claim to be totally objective.
For this, you can read the articles written by other reporters.
From me you'll find out what it's like to look at a man who likes to die useless.
Peter Moody claims that the Stewarts tried to spy on him and threatened to retreat from the race
Peter Moody claimed that the Stewarts Racing Victoria or tried to infiltrate a spy at his stables last year and threatened to withdraw immediately from the race.
He launched an attack on the stewards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria, claiming that they are running a personal campaign against him, the drop that filled the glass being Lady Tatai's elimination from the race because of a treatment administered on race day.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what was best for the field of racing and that it was put in a difficult situation when it came to the positive result on Lidari's cobalt test, for which he had no explanation.
For 18 months he swallowed his words about the statements about spies and did not want to look like the storm that didn't reach the grapes.
\"I wasn't going to say anything about that and I've been silent for a long time but sometimes you get to a level of frustration so high that everything went down and suddenly said Moody.
It's known that it went on.
Sometimes reactions have to bear the consequences, and I will have to live with what I said.
Tonight I'll go home and sleep quietly.
I want to head up and I want the owners I work with to see that you're trying to give them everything that's best.
From the moment they start to believe that this is not happening, you have to give up the training job.
At that moment I'll have to think about what I'll do with my certification.
Previously, Moody threw the bomb in an interview given for racing.com in which he said the integrity department tried to spy on his stables.
“After eighty months, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man - whose name I will tell him if I’m asked - and offered to hire him at my stables to provide information about the activity there, and Moody told Racing.com.
Obviously, he thinks I'm a cheater.
If so, then you should all quit because you were incompetent in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former and former RVL, David Moody, and current RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, knew at that time and even today.
Should I think it's personal?
Is it necessary for RVL to begin to have a spine and can people from outside the trains be held accountable for what is happening in the industry?
Do I have a bad influence on the industry?
So stupid is my influence on industry?
Maybe I can see the others.
Maybe I have to take my license and give it to one side and I have no doubt that the statements I make now might lead them to think about this variant.
But I've come to the point where I don't care anymore and that makes me sad.
It makes me very sad.
I'll put pressure on them and make them make a decision.
My family supports me and I can leave.
The frustration of the trainer grew with the lengthy investigation of the cobalt test involving Lidari and the elimination led him to say that he could get his license on the table and
Moody, whose name is most often associated with the training of the unwarranted champion Black Caviar, has labeled the race day treatment rule as \"ridicalal\" and after applying a cataplasm with mud or clay, which violates the rules.
He's breaking the rules of the race.
I have to take full responsibility for this and he says.
One of my employees accidentally slapped his leg.
It could have happened last night.
It could have happened yesterday, which you've happened.
It happened on race day.
Moody could be disqualified for three months for the race day treatment consisting of the application of the cataplasm, for which the Stewarts have opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
\"We all understand that there is a need for rules but it went too far and Moody said.
The driver who hit and fled from the crash site in Cobram was arrested
Police arrested a man after a collision with a biker produced in Cobram at the end of the week and followed by escape from the scene of the accident.
The biker was transported with helicopter to Royal Melbourne Hospital, being severely injured after being hit on Saturday morning by a car on Murray Valley Highway.
Police representatives say the driver of the vehicle didn't stop to help the injured biker.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man, he surrendered to the Shepparton police.
It appears that he will be accused of fleeing from the scene of the accident, of the lack of first aid and other road offences.
The bicyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, stays in hospital, stable.
Coach Melbourne Storm, Craig Bellamy, responds to their opponents in wrestling charges.
Coach Melbourne Storm, Craig Bellamy, called the criticisms of the paving tactics used by his team as denatured boyfriends and brought into discussion by the main two favorites in the NRL.
Coach Sydney Roosters, Trent Robinson, said that the referees allowed Storm players to win and the team in Storm's angry match in the final of qualification played on Friday night in Sydney.
The coach at Brisbane Broncos, Wayne Bennett, made an easy reference to Storm after his team's victory in the North Queensland Cowboys qualifying match, played Saturday night, when he called that match a “shower” and the rugby league and said the two teams in Queensland are not very good at wrestling.
Bellamy jumped into the defense of the paving tactics addressed by his team and said that the players were just focusing on the contact and when he was placarding.
Bellamy says she got trust after two important coaches criticized her team, which means they were worried that Storm will beat them.
And you know things don't stop here - I didn't hear Trent Robinson complain about wrestling when they beat us with score 24-2 and said Bellamy on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed anything all year round in our defensive systems or techniques, so much so that in the last six weeks we've really put the emphasis on contact in plates and so we've changed the situation.
Trent has been in this function for three years and obviously has a great team and it's probably not used to losing and it was a shock to him.
We know how it always happens in this time of year.
Bellamy contradicted Bennett's idea of raising the football and reminding his mentor St George-Illawarra Dragons of Bennett won the championship in 2010 playing football and plicitor and
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He argued his opinion comparing his Saturday night game with our Friday night game and talked about how exciting the game was and said Bellamy.
I remember that in 2010, St. George got a lot of criticism because he was a boring team and Wayne said he wasn't even interested in black under his fingernails.
But now he's got a team that can play what I considered to be exciting football, especially because of the speedy youth.
This kind of game you want to do when you have these players.
He brought this argument in 2010, now he wants everyone to adopt his style of game - not any team has two means like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to be able to play.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because they're kind of worried about the game with us.
Six weeks ago they probably didn't think of us when they were thinking about the big games.
Bellamy also highlighted the fact that the game between Storm and Roosters was a narrower competition related to the score compared to the match between Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably a good game, haven't I seen it yet, how much was the score? 16-12?
Our match ended 20-18, in our game there were two more tests, is that exciting game?
Or does palpitating mean taking breaks and not marking?
It's plans for me.
If I talk about us, it means that at some point we might meet them.
Storm has been free this week because they earned the right to play home either with North Queensland Cowboys, or with Cronulla Sharks, in the finals of next Saturday's preliminaries, at AAMI Park, the tickets being sold starting next Tuesday morning.
Stevan Hogg used the girl's phone to lure pedophiles into sending images
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to ask for pictures of abused children.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone when she was sleeping then authenticated to an online messaging service where another user sent her a number of indecent images having children as a subject.
The girl woke up later and noticed the disappearance of the phone, which she found in Hogg's hand while he was asleep.
She looked on the phone and found the disturbing messages after she immediately alerted her mother.
After arriving, the police saw the five photos and then analyzed computers found at that address and found disturbing searches on the Internet using terms to find indecent images of children.
Hogg claimed he did it to win pedophiles on the Internet before winning claims he's a cop to scare them
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee court: “It has been declared an addiction - that it is dependent on scaring people.
He admitted that he did computer searches but said he did it because he wanted to be a cop to scare pedophiles.
He was asked about conversations with the unknown person who sent him the images and the fact that he asked that person to send him other pictures.
He said he did it to lure.
He said he didn't think clearly when he drank that he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Mr. Robertson added: “Then when the girl found the messages on the phone, she cried out to her mother and trembled and cried.
The girl saw the indecent images on the phone and the defendant was confronted.
The girl was interviewed and told that the accused used the computer and the Playstation to talk to girls who seemed much younger than him.
Last year, on 14 June, Hogg, 23 years old, domiciled in Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to accusations that he had taken or taken indecent pictures of children, and violated the conditions of release conditional on 25 January this year and did not appear before the court on 24 March of the current year.
Defence lawyer Gregor Sim asked Hogg not to be registered in the register of sexual offenders because it can be said that this crime did not involve a significant sexual aspect and
Judge Alistair Carmichael postponed his sentence until October, on grounds of social reports.
Hogg was released on bail in this file but remained in custody before the appearances for other files.
He was passed into the register of sexual offenders before the sentence was given.
Robert Mugabe, President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, delivered the wrong speech in Parliament
At the beginning of the year, Mr. Mugabe, the oldest African leader, fell on the steps of a podium.
However, the filming of the fall has not been hurt on social networks.
The opening of the parliamentary session was also disrupted by opposition representatives who claimed that they would have received anonymous threats to death, threatening them not to evade Mr Mugabe during his speech.
Last month they fled him during his speech in Parliament - the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The head of the parliamentary group Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), Innocent Gonese, said that seven opposition politicians received text messages on mobile phones, being warned not to disrupt Mr Mugabe's speech.
\"The message was sent by a hidden number but it is titled \"dead\" and he told the newspapers after Mr. Mugabe's speech.
It alerts parliamentarians in question that immunity only applies in Parliament and once they leave Parliament, parliamentary immunity is no longer valuable.
The head of the parliamentary group said that the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, is \"concerned about the threats to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will make 30,000 availability
Hewlett-Packard is expected to make between 25,000 and 30,000 availability as part of the restructuring and cost reduction company's efforts in the service sector.
This year. HP will divide the stock market into two companies, separating the division of computers and printers from operations with corporate hardware and services in the glamorous city.
The expected availability will cost approximately $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter, HP said.
“These restructurings will bring to the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise a more competitive and sustainable structure in terms of costs and told Meg Whitman, the President and Director General HP, who will lead the unit after the breakup.
“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP today and will hold a broad business portfolio that will contribute to the transition of companies to the new business style and said Whitman.
Working as a separate society, we are positioned better than ever to meet the growing demands of our global customers.
According to a company statement, Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have annual revenues of over $50 billion and will focus on providing non-competitive integrated solutions to companies.
A company established in 1930 by Stanford University graduates, Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, having as its object the production of electrical equipment and whose garage in Palo Alto was called the president of Silicon Valley and
HP has gone through massive reorganization to adapt to switching from traditional computers to mobile devices.
The measure taken by HP, the second largest computer producer in the world and one of the largest technology companies in the US, is the latest in the field, based on the idea that companies that focus their attention better in a direction have a better performance.
FriendsFest: the comedy series that taught us important lessons about friendship between men
The absence of similar characters in the series is evident, given that the need for men to open up is now more desperate than ever, the suicide rates among young men reaching the tip of the last 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the leading cause of death in 20-45-year-old men in Britain, and remains three times more frequent in men than in women.
In an attempt to address the problem, the Campaign against Unhappy Life (Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM)) designated 2015 as the Year of the Man, wanting to question the culture that prevents men from asking for help when they need it.
The friendship lies at the centre of the struggle towards the success of this challenge.
A recent study conducted in more than 2000 of high school students who had symptoms of depression concluded that if the patient is surrounded by enough friends with a healthy mood and his chances of recovery doubled.
To the same extent, for people who are not depressed, a circle of healthy, mental friends reduces to half the likelihood of mental disorders occurring.
Of course, in order for friendship to take effect, it must first be accessible.
In this age of communication dominated by social networks, where the emphasis is placed on style and not substance, the immediate nature of the response often takes precedence before contact with significance.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to create a strong personality, open to fun and success, even if in reality isolation is the one that dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all with the cost of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship - that affects and deeper our mental health.
The billionaire inventor of a video game recently explained that money doesn't really buy happiness.
The beauty of the Friends series was that it directed attention to this idea.
The characters were not defined by work but by their own personality, which they showed by interacting as friends.
The humour of Joey and Chandler's frequent huggings, the moments when they look at football in the comfortable photos and Ross' passion for Rachel came from the fact that men are known to be associated with this situation, even though they often try to fully explore their feelings.
As a social worker explained to me: ...my role in listening to people with suicidal and depressed tendencies showed how even the smallest interactions with friends can make differences and
Often, people who call us don't feel able to talk to their friends.
The old saying to handle yourself is as strong as feeling to be perceived as a weak person if you speak openly about problems.
Friends is one of the series that comes to mind when I try to offer more psychological adaptation mechanisms in the long term.
The series highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
As much as it helps objective, external intervention, through the phone, people reach times of despair, long-term support comes from family and close friends.
Thus, if you participate in this week's event at FriendsFest organised by Comedy Central, with the complete editing of filming plates to celebrate the event, why not invite your friends to a coffee in Central Perk.
Or, and better, if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends is broadcast by Comedy Central from the beginning to the end - all 236 episodes - on #FriendsFest
Di Maria marks and helps PSG set Malmo aside
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after he scored against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored on Tuesday in his debut match in the League of Champions and helped PSG impose itself in front of the Swedish Malmo team.
Next we present the chronicle of the game and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani did their duty, Paris Saint-Germain starting the series of games in the League of Champions, with a quiet 2-0 victory against Malmo in the match played Tuesday on Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored in less than four minutes from the start of his debut match in the League of Champions in the PSG team, bringing the champions of France to the advantage of losing a series of opportunities before securing its advantage with the goal marked by Cavani in the minute 61.
Arriving in Group A with Real Madrid and Sahtior Donesk, Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions because the goal of the French team is not only optimising but also improving the route to the final quarter in each of the last three tournaments.
However, although the points were taken, Laurent Blanc's students were far from a perfect painting, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic who wasted the opportunity to empty after which he was replaced by his native city team and the club at which he started his brilliant career in 1999.
“It’s not easy to know at home or travel in the League of Champions, so that victory with 2-0 creates problems for our opponents and establishes a comfortable difference for the next class, even if there are other issues that we need to perfect throughout the season and the White declaration.
It's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we did, although I'm sorry we couldn't take another goal or two.
Ibrahimovic returned after the accident to one of the three changes to the Paris team, with a 2-2 discount obtained at Bordeaux's home in Liga 1 in the weekend, but Di Maria took the spotlight in the fourth minute.
Last month when he was transferred from Manchester United, the middle Argentine offensive was named the man who will take the PSG to the next level in Europe and demonstrated this when he ran to Marco Verratti's pass behind Malmo's defense before winning incredibly over Johan Wiland in the long corner of the right gate.
But if someone expected PSG to win by kicking their fingers, they were disappointed.
Malmo, who defeated Celtic in play-off to reach this stage and entered the field with nine holders on national teams, with a defense of five and two defensive mediums, was a powerful opponent.
But their attack wasn't impressive, except by making Nikola Djurdjic who passed Kevin Trapp's position in the minute 34.
On the other hand, PSG players slowed the pace a few times, taking a few unnecessary steps and not terminating the interventions, even Ibrahimovic who missed no less than five tests only in the first recovery and was then replaced by Cavani even after the game resumed.
However, Ibrahimovic proved to be much more valuable in supporting his colleagues, his concern being the one Di Maria sent in a deviating hold by Wiland over the gate in minutes 52.
The second goal was written in a final one after an hour of the match was run, thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan who enrolled the sixth empty of the season after Ibrahimic passed from Maxwell's center.
This goal eliminated the hopes of Malmo that they would rebalance the score and only a superb stop of Wiland remotely to reject David Luiz maintained the final score before the new Ezequiel Lavezzi entrance was cancelled in the long run.
The Norwegian coach of the Malmo team, Age Hareide, later claimed that PSG was with a class over and that \"The last game I played in the League of Champions was last December and
Since then, I've only played in the Swedish league, which doesn't rise to the same level.
Qualifications aren't enough.
Down the hat for the PSG.
They've made an excellent game.
Glencore collects $2.5 billion from stock sales
The Swiss mining giant Glencore, hit by the price reduction of shares on the freight exchange, collected $2.5 billion from the sale of shares as part of a broad debt reduction plan.
Glencore, quoted on the London Stock Exchange, said she sold 1.6 billion pounds of new shares to pay off the debt.
After losing 57% of its market value this year, the company takes a fall in prices from the commodity market, as China's economic activity decline influences demand and causes disaster in the market.
The preferential right of subscription increased the price of Glencore shares on the London Stock Exchange in Wednesday morning transactions.
The shares increased by 2.77% to 131.60 shillings at the FTSE 100 index, which opened at a value of 0.69% higher.
Glencore revealed the sale of $2.5 billion in shares as part of larger plans to cover almost a third of its debt of $30 billion.
The company sold the new shares at the price of 125 shillings per share, with 2.4% less than the closing price of Tuesday.
He pulled out of the company 1.3 billion shares, representing 9.99% of the group.
Concern about the growth of the long-standing Chinese economy led to a substantial rise in iron ore prices, with about half, and coal, copper and other goods decreased by 20-40%.
Xi calls for greater global economic expansion
Tuesday, President Xi Jinping told a group responsible for reforming that the economy must open up to the outside world to feed growth.
“China must commit to attract foreign investment and expertise and improve opening policies and Xi, as part of the 16th meeting of the Central Steering Group for the Continuation of General Reforms (Central Leading Group for Deepening Overall Reform).
Promoting openness and encouraging reforms will bring about a new bottleneck and vitality and will bring about economic growth, Xi said.
The Management Group has adopted a number of guidelines, including a negative list of market access regulation, relaxation of customs control policies, encouragement of State firms to absorb private capital and reorganization of the residence registration system.
According to the statement, a negative list will be drawn up identifying sectors and areas of activity where investment is not permitted.
The system will be tested gradually and improved by testing programs.
According to the declaration, the measure is important because it will provide the market with a greater role in resource allocation, ensuring a law-based business environment and providing a wider market opening.
State authorities will also weaken the controls on the powers they delegate to companies, ensuring that these companies decide how to conduct their business.
China will also allow border regions to explore new cross-border economic cooperation models and new mechanisms to promote regional growth, according to the declaration.
In an attempt to open state controlled sectors, several sectors will be open to private investment.
\"State authorities will not change their foreign investment policy and will protect the legitimate interests of companies set up from foreign investment and provide better services to them according to the declaration.
In addition, it will be easier for foreign citizens to apply for permanent residence permits or so-called green discharges and optimise requirements and fluidise the application process.
The meeting also discussed the guarantee of the right of practice of lawyers and the education of judges and prosecutors.
The meeting also attended the Prime Minister Li Keqiang and the leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement made after the meeting.
Education unions, unhappy with the government's proposal to raise wages by 10%
Negotiations between Prime Minister Victor Ponta and union leaders in Education have not reached any result, the Government proposing a 10% increase in salary from 1 December, with payment on 1 January 2016, and the unions wanted a 15% increase in November, or a 20% increase in December.
The talks took place at Victoria Palace on Tuesday evening, the prime minister being accompanied by the Minister of Education, Sorin Cimpeanu, the Minister of Finance, Eugen Theodorovici and the Minister of Labour, Rovana Plumb.
The government's proposal today has not thanked us, otherwise we would not have reached the position to summon the leaders of our federations.
The 10 percent that we've been promised today is less for us than we expected.

Right now I'm not sorry I left the country.
Then I felt bad, I was leaving a job behind.
That's how I thought it was good for me then, and I think it was good for me.
What happened to me when I was a selection officer, it wasn't normal, I wasn't respected, I don't respect my work.
I worked well with those before the Federation, but when Burlenu came to the Federation he came up with a preconceived idea, he didn't know me, he found out different opinions about me from the press.
It didn't change me because it was very difficult at the time, with the results I had, plus it was the financial situation in the middle.
I kept working, everything worked out very well and probably changed his ideas.
But I wanted to go.
If he wanted me to stay, then I proposed a contract increase.
We've got about 400 and something thousands of euros a year, and then I'm going to have around 600 thousand euros.
I didn't talk to Burlenu, but with his right hand.

The above source shows that the strategy aims to manage the phenomenon of immigration effectively, including general strategic objectives, specific objectives and action guidelines that reflect policies set at European level, adapted to national realities.
Given the problems faced by the states in the immediate vicinity of Romania, measures are being considered for the unitary and consistent management of situations arising from the possible occurrence of an influx of illegal immigrants into Romania, generated by the political, social, economic or military crisis.
\"Roman authorities will contribute to the creation of a system of flexible admission, but at the same time, they will pay particular attention to citizens from countries with potential migrationist or who may affect national security and add the remembered source.
The strategy identifies a number of factors that can influence immigration and asylum, including maintaining the conflict situation in Syria, reactivating the conflict in Iraq, maintaining an unstable situation in the border areas of Romania (Ukraine, Transnistria), perpetuating and increasing in intensity the Israeli-Palestinian armed conflict.
On the other hand, the document sets a number of general strategic objectives related to immigration, such as: promoting legal migration, more rigorous checks on the legality of the headquarters of third-country nationals on the territory of Romania, and the corresponding application of removal measures and restrictive measures, improving the national asylum system.
The national strategy includes specific objectives relevant to the implementation and implementation of the overall strategic objectives.
These include: facilitating access to the territory of Romania of third-country nationals responding to labour force employment needs, promoting access for third-country nationals to higher learning institutions in Romania for identified areas and professions as deficits.
With regard to the 2015 Action Plan, the Government appreciates that it is a means by which concrete activities are established leading to the creation of a flexible system for stopping the growing migration phenomenon.

The activity report of the TVR driver, rejected in committee: Stelian Tanase risks dismissal
Parliament’s Committees of Culture rejected the 2014 report of the Romanian Television Society’s Board of Directors on Wednesday.
In order to reject the report, 17 Members voted, one against rejection (Senator Varujan Vosganian) and one abstained.
The text of the report will be submitted to the Permanent Bureaus.
They'll decide, probably next week.
The next plenary meeting will be debated.
\"I believe that considering this situation will be done relatively quickly and said President of the Senate Culture Commission, Georgica Severin.
He added that the country of good feeling and that the TVR leadership should be present at this meeting, provided that no representative of the TVR leadership was present at the meetings of the Committees of Culture.
It was a good feeling to be in charge of the TVR because no one here has been subjected to personal attacks or anything like that.
The invitation has been made to members CA since last night, with an approximate hour that we didn't know new hours, but today, after the meeting of the Bureaus, I personally sent a fax to the TVR leader inviting her.
I think that the moment you're summoned, you're a budget employee, paid out of public taxes, and you're summoned to a meeting of committees even if you don't like living.
“Because it is your duty to serve, you are in an institution under the command of Parliament and said Severin after the meetings of the Committees meeting with Parliament’s culture.
He added that the financial aspects of the institution were discussed at the meeting on the basis of the negative opinion of the Budget Committees.
The debts we saw as they continued, came up with the idea that this year would be up to date, but they didn't pay for the historical ones.
“I will remind you that not because of my fault or someone else in these committees has lost that aggravation with banks and the fiscul, they are clear management issues and Severin stated.
He added that after the activity report will be rejected by the plenary meeting, they will follow elections for a new Board of Directors, and he will choose the general director of the institution.
I don't know who will be proposed for this function.
Wonders won't do.
The important thing is to make political decisions for this institution to work.
I'm not the man to lie to you, to tell you that there will appear a genius who will stand at the tail here and beat himself.
I hope that those who decide, the plenary of Parliament, by their vote, will choose with a lot of reason the people who will lead the TVR.
There must be people who know what's going on there, have experience and have a lot of correctness and respect for institution and tradition.
I don't know who it will be, if you ask me what qualities you have to have - good feel in the attitude of the employees because it's a curse of the little ones coming from the employees, the complaints, the dismissals.
\"When you get such sessions 50, 60, 70, something is rotten and we're talking about the financial situation that is a disaster and ended the president of the Senate Cultural Commission.
Although it did not appear in Parliament, the president-general of the TVR, Stelian Tanase, sent a letter to the president of the Chamber of Deputies, Valeriu Zgonea, requesting Parliament to consider a number of measures that could save and guarantee the economic and political independence of public television, including the number and indexing of the TV tax.
In the letter, Stelian Tanase requests, in addition to the indexation of the TV fee, to amend and supplement the HG 978/2003 on the charge for public television service, for the purpose of updating the provisions on daily technological change, as well as for the regulation of the procedure on TV tax control and the finding of countervailance and the application of penalties and penalties.
He also wishes to issue a provision to prevent the extension of the obligation for all electricity suppliers to become SRTv’s agents for the collection of the TV tax, by involving ANRE in regulating this activity.
In his view, it is necessary to establish a maximum ceiling of 5% of the commission in cash.
Stelian Tanase calls for the reduction of VAT quota for activities specific to the public television station and the contribution for CNC from 15% to 3%, but also the amendment of the Law 41/1994, in order to receive budgetary/financial allocations for the purchase of a licence for major cultural and sporting events - World Football Championship, Golden Circle, Eurovision.
He claims that SRTv will enter into incapacity for payment in the following months considering that labour law obliges the employer to enforce judgmental judgments, even if they are not definitive, and wage rights are accorded with priority to any other obligation.
The TVR administration has made constant efforts to reduce spending on staff and TV production.
“Astfel were reduced travel and other cost-generating activities, a number of commercial contracts were renegotiated, and at the end of July the TVR News post was closed and shown in the letter to President TVR.
He also appreciates that the disastrous financial situation cannot be resolved only by its own efforts.
\"Fare the support of the state institutions - Government, Parliament, Presidency - Roman television will be, sooner or later, in the impossibility of fulfilling its publication mission and is mentioned in the letter.
The conduct of the Chamber of Deputies decided to send the letter to the Committee on Culture.

The sections also realized that he was the best and that he would be wrong if they gave up on him.
It would have been the option to bring another player, much better, but nothing came out.
“There have been more discussions, such as with Mbark Boussoufa, but nothing has come true and Zaporojanu said for Digi Sport.
Lucian Sanmartean arrived at Al-Ittihad at the beginning of this year.
Elie Sarbu was voted Vice-President of the Court of Auditors
Parliament plenary voted on Wednesday to appoint Senator Ilie Sarbu, Prime Minister Victor Ponta, as Vice-President of the Audit Authority of the Court of Auditors.
According to Mediafax, 290 votes were recorded and 108 impoverished
The vote was secret, with newsletters.
The PNL representatives were the only ones who voted against this proposal, inform Digi24.
In addition, the liberals criticized Sarbu's appointment in this function and announced that they would contest it at the CCR, provided that he has a DNA file, but does not have the necessary preparation and experience.
Ilie Sarbu has 30 days available, according to the law, to resign from the Senate, because the new function of the Court of Auditors does not allow her to make politics.
The PSD Senator will serve as Vice-President of the Audit Authority of the Court of Auditors, remaining free after John Anton was revoked, following a decision of the Constitutional Court of September 2014, which found that he was appointed unconstitutional.

Bridge, accused of uncontrolled slander and irrational claims
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto strongly condemned, on Wednesday morning, the claims of Roman Prime Minister Victor Ponta according to which political decisions in Hungary are not known to be better than those of Syria, Libya or other countries of which refugees flee.
\"Last night, Victor Ponta lost his self-control and, through his irrational claims, embarrassed the whole Hungarian and handed the Hungarian minister of Externals into a statement.
Civilised European politicians do not say such uncontrolled slanders.
“His remarks have only one explanation: he lost his full support in Romania’s internal policy and added the head of Hungarian diplomacy, according to MTI.
On a Tuesday evening post on Facebook, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said he wants to attract attention and sanction the behaviour of high Hungarian government officials, who, in his opinion, are a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union and
I don't want to answer the challenges that have come from Hungarian government representatives.
\"This is a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union; and in anti-Semitic attitudes, and in the treatment of minorities of all types, and now during the refugee crisis, said Ponta on Facebook.
The Romanian Prime Minister added that he is committed to rational and sustainable solutions to the refugee crisis, appreciating that brutality and aggressive laws will not solve the problem.
Gambling, aggressive laws, imprisonment and brutality will certainly not solve the problem - they will only look like in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, they are policy-makers with nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which they are fleeing!
\"I believe in solidarity, in rational and sustainable solutions and especially in the superiority of European values - which we see in the last days in Hungary is in total contradiction just with these objectives and values and stressed the head of the Roman executive.
Earlier Tuesday, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto qualified as a simple lie and remarks of Roman Prime Minister Victor Ponta on the management by Hungary of the refugee crisis, appreciating that those claims are inappropriate for a 21st century leader, according to MTI.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy also mentioned on Tuesday that the extremist and lying remarks of the Romanian Prime Minister were the internal political crisis in Romania and stated that Budapest was looking for excuses from the Roman side.
Szijjarto referred to a statement made on Monday by Prime Minister Victor Ponta.
What I've always said and said is that I'm against xenophobic speeches to close the borders, that all who come are terrorists, are fools by the Middle Ages and I'm totally opposed to this approach.
If we can get more, we'll get it, the problem is our logistics ability to treat those people like people, not how our neighbors treat our Hungarians, with the beating with the insertion.
\"With this I disagree and said the head of the Romanian executive, at a press conference at Targu-Jiu.
Also Tuesday, Peter Szijjarto announced that the Government of Budapest has decided to start the field preparations for the enlargement of the border with Romania of the fence he is building at the border with Serbia, in order to deal with a possible change in the route used by migrants.
Later, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said that Hungary's decision to raise a border fence does not solve anything of the problem of refugees and \"choose Hungary from Europe\"
What is the connection between Osama bin Laden and the crushing of the macaral from Mecca?
The Saudi authorities announced that the Binladin Group Saudi giant, belonging to the family of Osama bin Laden, is partly responsible for the collapse of a macaral on Friday, on the Mosque Sea from Mecca, an accident following which 107 people died.
According to one investigation committee, the company did not observe the safety rules and reported to the Saudi press agency (SPA), reports BBC.
The company's directors were banned from leaving the country until the investigation was completed in this case.
The company will also be excluded from new public contracts.
The construction firm is owned by the family of the former leader of the Al-Qaida terrorist network, Osama bin Laden.
The company was founded by the father of Osama bin Laden 80 years ago and is currently run by the brother of former terrorist leader Bakr.
Binladen Group has been working for 4 years on the expansion of the Great Mosque, in order to host more pilgrims.
The accident occurred on Friday night during a storm, when a macara, probably unbalanced by the strong winds, collapsed on the aesthetic side of the cover of the Great Mosque from Mecca.
As a result of the accident, 107 people died and nearly 400 were injured.
How did Hagi shut them up?
Considered by many of the world's greatest Romanian footballer in history, Gica Hagi was labeled after withdrawing from activity as a weak coach who cannot be able to perform performances and in the new position.
After unfortunate experiences at the national team, Star or Galatasaray, Hagi took over, a year ago, the role of coach at the Future Constanta, the team he owns.
After fixed a year after the team took over, the King demonstrated that he was able to transform a team that was fighting to save himself from retrogradation into a top.
Thus, after a year of days, the Future registered, with Hagi coach, 16 wins, 11 remixes and 11 breakers.
The ballant is one of a top team that is battling at European Cups.
Things took a better turn for the Future this season, but the team arrived on second place in Liga 1, with 19 points, one less than the leader Astra Giurgiu.
The future also has the best attack in League 1, with 20 goals (equal to Astra), more than double than Star.
On the other hand, even though Hagi brought more experienced players to the team, Hagi continued the policy of promoting young people, and in the last period in the start team names such as Ianis Hagi or Hodorogea appeared.
The club’s policy made the Future a follow-up team for foreign teams, so Hagi sold 1.5 million euros this summer - Ianis Hagi (Florentina - 1 million euros) and Alexandru Mitrita (Bari - 500 thousand euros).
Along with the Star, the Future is the only profitable team in Liga 1, according to data from the Trade Register.
In the refugee crisis, Romania has played so far as a small country.
It's a legitimate strategy, but then you can't ask to be treated as the seventh country in the EU.
The big countries come with solutions for the entire EU, says Cristian Ghinea, a member of the CEO of the Roman Center for European Policies.
In an interview with Ziare.com, Cristian Ghinea pointed out that Europe cannot be transformed into a fortress, and the pure political means will not function in this crisis: “Perhaps we have doubts about the quality of the values with which these people come and
But there are masses that have started and we can't return history.
Migration is a reality to which we need to adapt as best and adapt them to us.
In the opinion of Cristian Ghinea, we are at an extremely emotional moment in which politicians feel their need to show their muscles.
After he passes, Europeans will not be willing to give up free movement, but the rules in the Schengen area must be changed: \"Schengen is now like an animal created in another era that was not adapted for the situation now and
Where are we in refugee crisis after this JHA council that actually didn't solve anything?
It is clear that EC President in agreement with Donald Tusk did not want to force a vote in the council.
All the predictions said they had the necessary votes.
Before the Treaty of Lisbon, the principle of unanimity applies in JHA and any state could block any decision.
That is why things have been very little integrated into justice and home affairs.
After Lisbon, the normal procedure applies, in which the EC has the initiative, and the Council approves it by a 55% vote, i.e. 16, representing 65% of the EU population.
The calculations said the votes existed.
But they didn't want to go forward.
Because it's a sensitive issue, there have been rejection reactions even in Germany against Merkel's opening policy and they didn't want it in many countries to appear that a ‘EU-type reaction sends us migrants on our heads and
They called for an ashtray, but the problem remains because, obviously, this wave creates a huge problem for the Schengen government and we will probably be witnessing big changes there in the next period.
So the mandatory quotas weren't really eliminated, but the subject was just allowed to cool down?
Yes, on the other hand, we are talking about a greater involvement of Frontex agency in the management of external borders, which means a change from the individual responsibility of members who are on the external border of Schengen to the responsibility of Community agents.
Greece's border with Turkey is also the border of Germany with Turkey, in fact, and this wave of migrants has given the boundaries of the old Schengen system.
Perhaps the Dublin principle will be waived, according to which migrants are responsible for the state in which they first enter, because it is not sustainable.
If Greece capitates, you can't say endlessly that it's the business of Greece.
Problem and commune.
Just because the problem is common, is it possible to solve it without a precise, perhaps even mandatory, mechanism of imparting the effort of receiving?
No one knows exactly how mandatory quotas will work if they are reached.
In order to remain a problem: what do you do with a man who does not want to come to Romania or Portugal, but in Sweden or Germany?
I don't think the European states will get on top of migrants: you go to country X or country Y.
It will probably reach unique filtration centres, in Greece or Turkey, where asylum applications will be processed.
He's working on solutions like this.
But the problem doesn't have a simple solution.
There are countries that have tens of years of experience in trying to integrate migrants, they are hard without any experience, like Romania, where the problem of migrants will increase the xenophobic current.
The truth is that we are talking about millions of people who are in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, who are in the camps and who have just begun to go to Europe.
One estimate says that only 10% have started to leave, winter is hard to go past the Mediterranean, but we expected next year to a wave maybe bigger.
What do we do with these people?
My prediction is that we're going to get used to this problem, we're not going to look at it so catastrophicly in the media.
Talk about countries with smaller or bigger experience.
Does it seem to you that there is any place where it has really succeeded in integrating large groups from an extra-European culture?
I'm looking at magrebians in France, Turks in Germany, they're still enclaved.
I wouldn't go to radical statements.
Of course, their integration is more difficult than other waves of migration, but that doesn't mean it doesn't fit in at all.
It remained an unintegrated part that created major social problems in France, Germany, Britain.
But police-only means won't work.
To create Europe's fortress is illusory.
We need to address integration mechanisms in European societies.
Here were some mistakes.
We have to be more careful.
To ask these people to learn the language, to try to take the values, not to stay with a foot in Europe and with one in their country of origin, bringing the rest of the family including by couples of convenience.
But the imminent problem of these people's long-term problems of their integration must be separated.
If others failed to integrate in the long term it doesn't mean we have to look at them as they drown in the Mediterranean.
Maybe we have doubts about the quality of the values these people come with.
And if there's going to be an intervention in Syria, which I don't think, it doesn't mean he's going to make the country over the night and you can take them back.
Until it comes to solutions, we see Europe's strengths.
The borders are closed, the walls are rising, border controls are being reintroduced in the Schengen area.
Is the European project in danger?
The European project as it does not, the Schengen space as it was built, yes.
It was built quite minimally and arranging the rules so that the pressure was too high on the countries where I put my foot for the first time these migrants.
I mean, we're circulating free from there, but everyone's got his problems.
In the face of such a wave it can't be like this, because some countries don't make a face.
When there are such waves of emotion, politicians want to show that they do something, but in the long run it doesn't change much.
After the attacks in France we don't have much more dramatic anti-terorist legislation in the EU than we had last year.
It's a wave of public emotion that settles both ways.
And it's so unstable from one week to another that you can't make decisions based on it.
We have a lot of talk, a lot of bellicose statements from politicians at home under pressure to be virile.
And then, you have the dramatic case of the unborn child in Turkey and the public opinion is excited.
After public emotion passes, we will return to the reasons why we created this space, this freedom of movement that is not only for people, but also for good.
This is the real European single market.
And I don't think Europeans will give up this principle of freedom of movement.
That there's gonna be other rules is different.
Schengen is now like an animal created in another era that was not adapted for the situation from now on.
How did Romania play so far in this crisis?
As a small country, who thinks that, if he pulls his dick on his eye and licks his ears, the subject disappears.
In front of the reality of the waves of migrants, you can choose to be part of the solution or say it's not your problem with the small country.
That's what we did, it's a legitimate strategy, but then you can't ask to be treated as the seventh country in the EU.
You're not, you're not playing at the country level.
Big countries come up with solutions for the whole EU, good or bad, we are not discussing their quality now.
Like Poland did.
On the other hand, the effect of this crisis is that the appetite of the Romans for Schengen will drop very much.
President Iohannis says it might be good if I didn't get in already.
So we move from despair to a more pragmatic position, but the goal remains.
There is of course a risk if Romania and Bulgaria enter Schengen so that migrants can see us as an alternative route.
Which does not mean that it is a reason not to enter Schengen anymore, but to be more pragmatic.
Romania will be part of Schengen, and Schengen will exist, but transformed in the sense that the external borders will become joint responsibility, will be unique rules of acceptance of migrants, the single rules of deportation for those who do not receive asylum, the single rules for countries considered safe.
The Ukrainian president said that after Russia turned his attention to Syria in Ukraine, no one else died.
Is there a connection between the two focus, a Russian game?
Russia has a frustrated power behavior.
She thinks it's a great power to confuse Americans and Europeans.
From this point of view, yes, there is a connection.
Without the military and financial effort of the Putin regime, the Assad regime would probably have collapsed long ago.
And it was good to crash before the principal or opponent was the Islamic State.
Some two years has been a struggle between the Assad regime and the moderate lay and Muslim militias, supported by the Gulf and Western countries.
Then the Islamic State rose and now we don't know if we want the Assad regime to fall.
Russia was able to complicate things, but it cannot participate in the solution.
It creates focus on instability and chaos that it can't shut down.
But you're great power only if you have so many solutions.
The off-side game is just a strategy to gain time.
Maybe Putin's waiting to make offers to him, he'll hit the buttons to solve the situation.
Offers don't come because the world isn't convinced that he can solve one way or another the whole thing created by him.
But I don't agree with the theories that these people are driven by an invisible hand.
Let's not see Putin stronger than he is.
What button is going to show up soon
Millions of Facebook users have gotten used to the Cookie news button and now the representatives of the Social Network are preparing the other opposite, the \"Dislicke\"
Marti, Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and CEO of the company, announced on the account or that this button will be available soon, informs New York Times on the blog.
Zuckerberg mentioned that the \"Dislike\" button and will rather show a shade of what a user feels than a simple option.
However, the announcement or raised the problem that Facebook could become a less friendly place.
Zuckerberg mentioned that he wants to avoid moments when someone posts on the account or an important event in life, and someone else will give it to us
Network users, who have reached 1.5 billion active accounts, have long called for the opportunity to express their negative emotions or empathy with something sad.
Mark Zuckerberg also said that it is not very comfortable for his people to give him/her/her/her/her/his/her/its/its/its/its/its/its/its/its/its/its/its/its/its/its/its/its/its/its/its/its/its/its/its/its/its/its/its/its/its/its/its/its/its/its/its/its/its/its/its/its/its/its/its/its/its/its/its/its/its/its/its/its/its/its/its/its/its/its/its/its/its/

The variant of a new button on Facebook wasn't well received by everyone.
“There is already enough hatred on Facebook and on social networks and commented Atiq Haneef in Afghanistan, on the Facebook page of New York Times, where the article with this topic was posted.
\"I'll give 'Dislike' to the 'Dislike' button and specified it.
Roger Anderson, a microbiologist from Atlanta, claimed there is nothing wrong with this button, encouraging people to have different opinions on Facebook.
Debra Aho Williamson, social media analyst at eMarketer company, mentioned that it is hard to imagine that a single button can transmit a complex range of negative emotions.
Moreover, she supports it, is approaching the electoral campaign in America, and the \"Dislike\" button would create a total disaster.
Only 70 refugees entered Hungary in 24 hours
Hungary accepted only 70 migrants on Tuesday, a hand of thousands coming to the table at its southern border with Serbia, announced the government councillor Gyorgy Bakondi.
Hungary declared emergency during the day in two counties along the border with Serbia because of the refugee flow, closing a main border crossing point and announcing that it would build a fence at its border with Romania, DPA recalls.
The mass has attracted a sudden reaction from Serbia.
Just yesterday they said they'd seal the border for those who want to pass, but not for those who want to ask for asylum.
“As you can see, this is totally different and the Serbian minister for refugees, Aleksandar Vulin, said.
Prior to the imposition of the new immigration legislation, a record number of 5,809 migrants entered Hungary on Sunday, announced Monday the police.
Over 170,000 migrants from the Middle East and Africa also went to Hungary in Serbia in 2015.
Many avoid being registered and try to reach the West, especially in Germany.
\"The new headquarters of the Jewish Council is about to pike.
Two builders, in insolvency
The massive investments made here in recent years, in order to move the institution, are falling apart because they have been stopped several times.
Two major builders who worked here entered insolvency during the work.
The headquarters of the County Council of Vasile Aleksandri Street will end up falling down on its own.
In a year and a half since the building's consolidation and recast work had been completed, the works have not reached half.
One last step in the era of the building was consumed the last days when the National Council for Dispute Resolution (CNSC) rejected a complaint from the company that wanted to take over the contract to implement the technical project for the works that are still to be carried out.
The original project was drawn up by Impex Romcatel SA.
After the insolvement of the manufacturer and the termination of the work, the negotiation procedures were initiated without the publication of an announcement of participation with Impex Romcatel, the firm next to update the technical project, and then to be organised a new tender for works.
“Businesses did not end through a contract, however, appreciating that the proposed form would have disadvantaged the institution and summed up Rázvan Timofciuc, represented public relations within the CJ.
The CJ decision to interrupt direct negotiations was attacked in court by Impex Romcatel.
The incoming court sent the complaint to the CNSC, which rejected it as late.
This does not mean, however, that CJ can start looking for another designer.
Impex Romcatel has the possibility to attack the CNSC decision at the Court of Appeal, just after a final sentence of it being able to take into account the finding of another designer.
Thus, building consolidation work could be resumed earlier next year.
Our intention is to restart the work as soon as possible.
In principle, the renovation of the technical project should not take long, but we must reach the conclusion of a contract.
\"We're waiting to see whether CNSC's decision will be attacked or not,\" Timofciuc said.
The strengthening of the former headquarters of the Police Station began in 2011.
A first work contract was terminated in April 2012, after work of 4.5 million lei.
The auction was resumed, the contract being aided by Moldoconstructed SA.
However, the firm entered into insolvency, and this contract was terminated after 1.5 million lei had been paid.
The work has so far been carried out in proportion to approximately 50%.
Initially, the building's consolidation, rebuttal and maintenance work had been evaluated at 7.7 million lei.
\"Look, I'm saying everything -- statements that could frame the former head of the Cadastru
One of the employees involved in the scandalous file at the Cadastre Office signed an agreement to recognise the facts, against jail with postponement.
Most likely, his statements will incriminate the other defendants, in front of the former chief, Narciza Nedelcu
A counsellor from the Office of Real Estate Advertising (OPI) charged with DNA in a corruption file recognized his TV station.
The Agreement on the Recognition of Acts signed by Dumitru Dăsălu was registered yesterday at the Court of First Instance, with the judges establishing a solution in this case on 29 September.
Dumitru Daniel Dăsălu was accused of false intellectuals in continuous form and agreed to execute two years in jail with postponement as well as work for the benefit of the community.
With regard to the facts imputed to Dăsălu, the Prosecutors stated that he, as counsel of the Cadastre Office, together with other colleagues, had drawn up in false acceptance proceedings, sold the contracts of services previously signed by the O.C.P.I. and the directors of the SC Gauss SRL, SC Group Cinci SRL, SC Topo Euro Cad SRL, SC Agencies of As Dastru and Topography SRL and PFA Lip and Stephen, who found that the services contracted were carried out in total, under conditions that they were not carried out and were not submitted to O.C.P.I.
Last days, the former head of the Office, Narciza Nedelcu, but also other former or current OCPI employees were sued in this case, the charges being the counting of services to those companies, although the works were not carried out.

Adventures in the Stone Age
In the opinion of FRH, Alexandru Dedu, Romania can host a major handball competition only in 2024, and the preparation of the national handball for qualification at the Olympic Games costs a fortune.
The president of the Romanian Handbal Federation, Alexandru Dedu, said yesterday, during a press meeting, that it is a great pride that our country has three teams in the League of Champions.
With regard to Romania's national women's handball team, the main objective is to qualify for the Rio Olympic Games, but for that it must go through two stages of rubber forks, first of all the World Championship and secondly the pre-qualification tournament and Dedu said so.
We really want to qualify for the Olympics.
There are some fantastic requirements from the technical staff led by Tomas Ryde.
Staff that will be composed of seven or eight persons.
He wants secondary coach, doctor, two masonry, carrier coach, physical preparer, head of delegation.
They've asked us to qualify some things, exactly materials for physical training, that we've never heard of.
These all to get to the Olympic Games. And I will do everything I know of to have them.
We're talking about a massive investment, they're the same, and the money.
But this is the way to make performance.
Because at the moment we're in stone season with preparation.
“The teams with which we are being beaten have these materials and have some time and said Dedu, who mentioned that he is trying to get the necessary amounts to purchase these products from MTS and COSR.
The president of FRH also referred to the infrastructure in Romania and to the possibility that our country will host a major handball competition.
We don't have a hall in Bucharest.
It is a problem of infrastructure and it is shameful to be questioned by a European Gymnastics Championship.
Let's not forget that in other corners of the world, Olympic districts have been built entirely over a period of two years.
Before 1992, in the current Olympic area in Barcelona it was a garbage dump, and now it has become a reper of beauty.
The same thing happened in London, where the 2012 Olympics were a success in terms of investment.
\"In my vision, in 2024 we can host a major competition and said Dedu.
He added that international handball bodies are willing to grant Romania the organisation of a major competition.
It's a priority for me to bring major handball competitions to Romania.
Mr. Gausu went civilized with a project, people gave his agreement in principle, but they soon became clear that the hall will never be built.
And I had discussions with the EHF, I told them we wanted, that we were able to organize and they said they agreed and we invited them to the first game in the new hall in Bucharest and then we discussed concrete.
“So we have all the opening, and at the EHF and IHF, but we don’t have infrastructure and explained to the officer FRH.
The former great handballist avoided assessing the chances of women's teams CSM Bucharest and HCM Baia Mare to reach the Final Four: “I have asked all trainers to be booked in predictions, that if they do not comply they will turn against them and

Romanian Rugbits debut on 23 September, against France
The captain of the national rugby team, Mihai Macovei, said, Tuesday, at a press conference, that all the members of the Romanian Lot are ready for the World Cup matches in England, where he hopes to win two victories: \"We are ready and ready to go.
Both me and my colleagues are with engines at full speed.
We've trained to give the best performance in the four games.

All the groups are heavy and ours is the same.
Let's take it easy, first with France and then we'll see.
However, if we win with Canada, the match with Italy will be our final.
I can't describe in words the joy of World Cup participation, it's the meeting of so many years of work.
I wish I didn't disappoint anyone in the rugbi's family and come with beautiful results at home.
“We want you to be proud that some players, a small family like rugby in Romania, proudly represent the tricolor and told Macovei.
The selection of Romania's national team, Lynn Howells, who is at first experience as coach at the World Cup, hopes to make Romanians proud of the rugby selection: “It is a great honor for us to participate in this World Cup and
I'm sure the players are ready to participate in the tournament.
It's an extraordinary experience for me.
For me it is very important that every match makes Romanians proud of the national team.
President of the Romanian Rugby Federation, Haralambie Dumitra, is confident that Romanian players can confirm the progress made in the last years in rugby.
We have a very difficult group and we want to confirm the progress made to the national team.
I wish the sportsmen success, and I am convinced that we will be at the same time as the event.
“These guys started playing in Romania’s teams at 18-19, so there is cohesion, it’s a band of friends, who set to realize a dream and said Dumitra.
At the World rugby Cup in England, Romania will evolve in Group D, with the following scheduled matches: with France on 23 September in London; with Ireland on 27 September in London; with Canada on 6 October in Leicester; with Italy on 11 October in Exeter.
Competition starts Friday, at Twickenham stadium in London, with the England-Fiji match in group A.

14 million lei from the Hospital “Sf. Spiridon and Ia to the correction of the budget
What will be purchased with this important amount of money?
The Hospital \"Sf. Spiridon\" received approximately 14 million lei from the Ministry of Health, following budgetary correction.

The clinic will work in the area where there is allergology, hematology and endocrinology in the ambulance and will have about 30 beds.
Take the city, made of laughter from RATP controllers and a folder.
Guard of a tourist
A tourist family from Cluj came to Go and visited him, but the trip ended with a bitter promise.
After the experience, my wife and I didn't want to go back to your town.
Unwanted, they hit the wrong information from the folds, the rudeness of the RAPT controllers and, bonus, a fine and says the law
The wives arrived in Iga and a few days ago, stayed in a hotel in the Centre and demanded tourist glittering.
They also received a fold in which the RATP tracks were passed.
“ Armed with these maps, the wives visited the city.
But two days ago, you were in Copou, they wanted to get to Palas Mall.
Because it wasn't a ton of tickets at the station near the Copou Park, they relied on the information printed on the fold: they can take the ticket via SMS.
No one told them that this service no longer exists.
Trusted in the fold, they climbed into a bus and tried to send SMS after the instructions on the fold.
Unfortunately for them, a RATP control team appeared.
They said that there was no longer a two-year service and that he reported to the press that he was cancelled.
Where did I know what was written in the local press, coming with an evening before I visited the city?
I talked to the controllers, explained the situation, said they didn't care, it wasn't their job.
The attitude was very challenging.
They said all they can do is give us one fine instead of two (half the wife).
\"I paid, I didn't want to ruin my day's visitation stand at the gendarmerie and give statements there, and the story and Ovidiu.
In conclusion, the family was amended due to erroneous information on the fold and controls that had applied the law in the blood and
It's not fair, and I've done a session at RATP Iasi to get my money back.
It's not about money, it's not about a lot of people, but the point is I was wrong.
Poison for the rapeers in Vaslui.
They had an accident and remained in preventive custody
The trial of the seven rapists in Vaslui moved yesterday to the Court of Appeal Iaşi.
The outgoing magistrates judged the first term of judgment in a non-public sitting in which the seven young men accused of mocking an 18-year-old asked to be released.
Before the beginning of his own trial, one of the outgoing judges, who had been assigned his file, Viorel Munteanu, made an application for abstention, which was admitted by his fellow members from the court.
The Magistrate activated until the summer of this year at the Vaslui Court, where the president of the Section On Nale was the one who, on 9 April, admitted a challenge by four of the defendants, having their place in custody at home.
At present, the file is judged by a complete of which are the magistrate and the Maricica Mititelu and Geta Sandu.
Previously, in the file he made an abstention and Judge Dan An ton, on the reason that his daughter is in a concubination relationship with one of the rapists' lawyers.
The two judges decided that the Vaslui's rapists would remain under preventive arrest.
Your nerves will remain incarcerated for at least 30 days, when judges will reconsider their possibility of releasing them.
The following term of judgment will take place at the Court of Appeal on 6 October.
Before arriving at the Court of Appeal, the van with which the violators of Vaslui were transported was involved in an accident produced in the neighborhood of Păcurari, the car entering the Ia and on the belt.
The Iveco self-utilitarian they were carrying and the seven rapists hit a Volks wagen car that got off the Canta street, and the driver tried to turn left.
The Duba circulates from the end of the Scavengers.
The car entered Iga and around here because the Penitentiaries Administration employees preferred the route from Vasului to Ia and to Gajduri, then to the seatbelt.
They cut the road a few miles.
Immediately after the impact, the escort arrested and called for another transport, to take over the detainees.
In a short time, at the scene of the accident, a car was sent from the Maximum Security Prisoner, who took the seven prisoners and transported them to the Court of Appeal.
As a result of the accident, none of the arrests were injured.
In order to transfer them to the other van, the guards surrounded the back of the car and arrested them in speed, two and two.
\"The incident has not been reported to the police, because drivers of cars have understood themselves amicably with regard to the damage to be paid and said Chief Commissioner Madalin Şăranu of the IPJ.
Great migration
Romania is not and will not be prepared for what will follow.
What about Europe?
I say it from the beginning, clearly and brilliantly: the 7000 refugees that Romania should and should naturalize are, in itself, an insignificant number, but huge compared to the ability of the Romanian state to manage such a project.
For Romania, even the voluntary quota proposed by Bucharest, in the amount of about 1500 souls, it greatly exceeds the good intentions of solidarity with the European Union expressed in recent months.
Surely, if those migrants really will agree to settle in our localities, the chances of rapidly integrating them into Romanian society are extraordinaryly small.
I'm sure they'll be the first to lose your patience.
Parasited by paralysed interlops by a venal political class, the Romanian state proves impotent in all areas.
The inability to integrate the gans is just a trivial example.
In addition, governments of any color were unable to absorb European funds, make roads, kindergartens or modern schools, provide decent medical assistance, tighten the mess on the street, create honorable paid jobs, or keep their own young generation home.
Why would refugees settle in another country they flee from?
But what makes a lot of wonder is, in particular, the hypocrisy with which such a crisis is being treated.
We are first hit by the bellicose festery of the strong states of the EU, which are showing maximum generosity when it comes to sharing problems with the smaller countries.
Then comes the fearful hypocrisy of the Romanians who, although they have millions of relatives scattered around the world, do not yet accept the other - of other language, of another religion, of another blood.
Probably afraid of not stealing anyone from their national being.
After all, there is also a hypocrisy of many migrants, who, although they only invoke the horrors of war as a reason for departure, accept no other destination of the exodus than Germany or the Nordic countries.
Now, not all refugees are Syrians, and in Pakistan it's not war.
Also, the simplistic way in which the crisis is analyzed can only be delayed.
The causes must be eliminated, supported by some countries, by putting strictly on the book of political correctness, calling for peace and investment for migrants' countries of origin.
But in Romania there is peace and even more, from time to time, some foreign capital in the national economy - but that does not prevent tens of thousands of Romanians from leaving their country every year.
Why are they leaving?
In this crisis, the European Union has revealed itself to us as an anchored, disjointed and out of the picture.
I was complaining that Romania is not capable of inventing a country project, but here is that the EU does not have any plans for the future.
And improvisations and threats don't help anything.
Then, to what use does the EU, if the only advantage the Romanians enjoyed - the right to free movement - could be discussed because of the waves of refugees crossing the border like cheese?
At some point, the war in Syria will be over.
I don't know the migrant crisis, though.
Over the next decades, overpopulation, poverty, climate change, resource depletion, etc. will push millions of desperate migrants from Asia and especially Africa to a better life.
With such politicians, Romania is not and will never be prepared for what will follow.
7,000 euros a year to rent Pogor Club.
Destination, practically, imposed
The concession auction shall cover a period of 10 years.

The concessionaire will have to operate continuously in the building and to cover the entire costs of rehabilitation of the building, in accordance with the technical project to be drawn up.

They're stable, as doctors say.
EXCLUSIVE: A meeting that breaks your heart.
At 20 years of age he received a brave gift: biological parents
Lost in the hospital in poor condition, in the dark of the '90s, when she had only two months of life, small, sickly and helpless, and then adopted by a wealthy family in Italy, in the same years that she adopted was a regulated vague, a young woman, now a blonde and beautiful girl, met again the other day in Ia and with biological parents from a village of the county, after almost two decades when no one knew anything about the others.
Crina will fulfill these 20 years, and her adoptive parents in Palermo have thought to offer their beloved daughter a stunning and courageous gift: a visit to Romania, to Iasi, to know her unclear past.
“The IceZiare, who attended the search efforts of the family of origin after a few extremely vague hints, was a witness to these meetings that practically broke his heart.
The reports of reporters, the emotions of the moments, the statements of those involved, their reactions are moving and overwhelming.
The story of Crina begins 20 years ago in the exit town Ruginoasa, while she was only two months old.
Then, because of a health problem, the girl had to be admitted to the hospital, the city.
At home, misunderstandings began between parents, and the mother was forced to leave home.
He decided to keep the girl and send me home.
He stopped the girl, and I haven't known anything since.
“When I found out she was in the hospital, she was too late and remembers Alina, the girl’s biological mother.
Crina was interned with her grandmother at the municipal hospital in Pascani, and still the father of the daughter, Costica Balkans, left for work in the city of Alexandria, Teleorman County.
Their lives were to split permanently.
They haven't found Crina in the hospital.
After hospitalization, Crina's father left for work in another town, and returned after six months.
Meanwhile, the girl was transferred to the hospital in Iasi, and the father, when he came back, never found her again.
I think it had been almost nine months since the girl was in the hospital.
\"I would have thought she was abandoned and a family niece and story.
Because of the financial problems, Grandma couldn't come with Crina to Iasi, and the girl remained in the care of the doctors.
Because no one has ever been interested in the child's fate all this time, she was taken over by the Directorate General for Social Assistance and Child Protection, which then gave her to care for the Center for Placement in Bucium.
It was years when the abandonment and adoptions were more legibly regulated in Romania today.
At the Bucium Center was found by Italian Salvadore and his wife, a couple from Palermo who wanted to have their child but did not network.
They fell in love instead of blonde Crina, and after some time she was going to move permanently with them to Italy.
The little ones had already done almost two years, while the adoption formalities lasted.
When I saw Crina, I felt like she was our girl.
“As my wife would have given her life and told us by smiling Salvadore, the adoptive father, while catching in his hand the daughter’s beautiful hand.
In the country, Crina's parents, Alina and Costica, continued their search separately, wherever they could.
The father asked the authorities in Ruginoasa, but he received no answer where his child might be.
The police then sent him that he might be killed, but at Ia and the parents found out what really happened to their daughter.
When I looked for her here, they told the Court that she was gone to Italy at Palermo.
And the conditions I've never had to look for her.
We prayed to God to be good.
I've been thinking about her in all the years that have passed, but there were no possibilities to walk, to find her.
“It’s hard and it tells us about tears in the eye of Crina’s biological mother.
But even though years have passed, the parents of Ruginoasa were not forgotten.
In Italy, Salvadore and his wife explained to the girl where she came from that her past linked her to Romania.
I was little when I found out.
I think I was five or six years old.
I reacted like a child, I was curious.
“I wanted to meet my parents from Romania and confessed and delighted Crina.
And her dream was gonna come true.
In March of this year, Commissioner Romique Ichim, director of the Regional Centre for Prevention, Assessment and Counselling Antidrog Iaşi, was contacted by a knowledge of Italy, which explained Salvadore's desire to find the biological family of the Crina.
And the searches only started from a name.
After the request we had from our partners in Italy, we started our first steps.
We were just getting a name, Baltic Coast, then the locality, Ruginosa.
In a short time we had an activity with the mayor's office there, and I could ask if there's any local name received.
Then they gave me a few indications, just that the person found wasn't the one they were looking for.
“It took about a month before we found the girl’s biological father and explained to us Commissioner Romique Ichim.
In total, more than three months have taken the authorities to find Costica and Alina, especially that they each have their own home in another locality.
We started out somewhere in March, and in June-July we completed identifying biological parents and discussions.
“Then I established that a first meeting would take place in September and added Romania Ichim.
In the weekend that passed, the Costa Rican Alina saw her first missing girl in the hospital halls in Iasi, 20 years ago.
Father, excited, could barely control his tears, and his hands trembled unhesitatingly.
He just changed a few words with the people around him.
A week before the meeting, she couldn't sleep anymore.
He was all excited, trembling.
“To see your baby after so many years, it’s something and tell us a niece, come and she with Costica from Ruginosa.
Meeting the Crina with the biological mother and brother
In discussions with his daughter, who is going to study at a well-quoted university in Italy, Costica Balkan told her, among other things, that if she ever wants to return to him, in the village, she can come quietly: she can give him some sheep, goats, to find her a boy in the village and to land a household.
Mom is nervous, she cries, and she hardly believes that and something can happen to her.
I'm very excited.
I didn't think anything could happen.
I've seen the same cases on TV, I've been thinking about these years, I hoped, but I didn't think I could be the same.
They're very emotional.
If he could forgive me.
I hope we visit in the future.
“I hope we can maintain a bond and tell us with great tears on the cheeks of Alina, the mother of Crina, while holding tight in the hands of a servant.
In him she hides her tears, of happiness, because in a short time she will see her face after so much bitterness for long.
On the other side, Crina, who will accomplish only a few days, this month, 20 years, tries to calm down as an emotional child.
She doesn't know what to expect, but she's drawn a vague idea about her biological parents.
He thinks they're young, but now before the meeting he's trying to get his thoughts together, because he has a lot to say, but nothing to reproach.
My parents are two moms and two dads.
But my parents are eventually the ones who raised me.
It'll be a beautiful meeting, a wonderful experience.
\"I hope I have a beautiful memory with them, because now there are so many things to say and confess to us and Crina.
First family meeting in Iaşi
In the Unirii Market, under the early autumn sky, the Ruginoosa family once again unites their destiny with their girl in Palermo.
Crina's 20 years ago, she finished high school, after the Italian school model, but she can start a new chapter with Alina and Costica, her biological parents.
I don't break the borders or countries, but only one barrier: the language.
Over which, with the help of a translator, an Italian local owner in the center of the city, passed easily.
Those who have managed to make this meeting possible say that it is the first such event made, so that, in the future, if there is any opportunity, they will do it again.
It's the first event this way organized, such an emotional charge, and I'm glad to be successful.
We at the Centre have different activities, and most of the time we are associated as an institution that deals only with people who are drug-dependent.
But we're trying to restore the company and something good back.
“If I’m still asked for such an event, I’ll do it with great love and say smiling Romique Ichim, director of the Regional Centre for Prevention, Evaluation and Counselling Antidrug Iaşi.
Behind him, the Balkan family, with Crina in the middle, is moving away from the story.
I understand: they have a lot to tell one another.
Armistice with guns at the foot yesterday at the PSD.
Everybody shoots your soul
Tables from the PSD's outgoing branch have finished a leg gun.
After successive rounds of talks, carried from Friday to Sunday, the first and most tense, the PSD leaders agreed to temporarily suspend hostilities.
The party's executive president, Liviu Dragnea, is to present a united, social-democracy position and will send the party a full list of potential candidates to the party's functions.
Far from having ended, the party's internal war seems to have just taken a break to allow fighters to shoot their soul.
Dragnea didn't give an ultimatum.
He has launched a very simple and very current message under the conditions of now: try to find a solution so as not to jeopardize the party.
On October 3rd, we have party elections.
All functions will be made available to those who want them.
“ Until then, we remain in the existing structure and specified the interim mayor, Mihai Chirica.
The two days of weekend discussions only led to the conclusion that nothing was fixed.
In the October elections, for the safety function of the county subsidiary of the PSD, an acute competition is expected.
On the short list of possible candidates for the main function of the party's outgoing branch is the Secretary of State Maricel Popa, Senator Florin Constantinescu, Senator Sorin Lazarus, the county councilman Vasile Quantea and the interim President of the County Council, Victorel Lupu.
They could be added to the mayor of Schitu Duca, Mihai Mihalache.
A variation taken into account is also the candidacy of the leader of the county councillors of the PSD, Cristian Stanciu, where Lupu will no longer enter the race, sources of the party claiming that it is not interested in function.
The only name that has not been mentioned by any of the participants in the negotiations in the last few days is that of former subsidiary leader, Mayor Gheorghe Nichita.
The candidate list is open.
According to the statute, even on election day, candidates can be submitted, and would not admire anyone if it happened.
And what's important is that we stay united, and we'll stay there after October 3, when we have a new Executive Office, a new Permanent Jewish Bureau and all new leadership structures and specified how much.
Until internal elections are held, the leadership of the county subsidiary of the PSD will be ensured by Victorel Lupu, a close associate of Nichita and Stanciu.
Lupu, however, is on leave until 29 September, preparing the elections in practice to be ensured by the executive secretary of the branch, the county councillor Mihail Popescu, in relation to the Nichita camp.
Contacted by telephone, Cristian Stanciu has appreciated the talks of the past few days as leading to a partial consensus
There is wide availability to maintain balance and unity in the party.
It has reached a partial consensus in the sense of supporting a uniting team to deal with the county.
\"But, on the other hand, there are several variants of the intentions related to the application of PSD presidents Ia and, on the other hand, the list remains open and Stanciu commented.
An outgoing judge refused the Vaslui rapist's file on the grounds of concubination
The seven young people in Vaslui County convicted of rape today arrive at the Court of Appeal Iaşi.
The Vaslueans sentenced to imprisonment between five years and eight months and eight years and four months today will present their arguments on their release, after the substantive court, the Vaslui Judgeship, established their imprisonment immediately after the sentence was handed down.
The file was registered at the Court of Appeal at the end of last week, Judge Dan Anton making an application for abstention, admitted by his colleagues.
Anton invoked that one of the defendants, Bogdan Luca's lawyer, is his daughter's concubine, Dana Anton's lawyer.
Luke defends Silviu Ovidiu Burada, who has received the greatest punishment in this file.
How the Judges Reasoned the Judgment
At the end of the past week, the judge at the Vasului Judgment who sentenced the seven young men to serve the sentence.
In motivation, the judge speaks of the sharp reaction of the indictees, but also of those who supported them, stating that such attitudes create a strong sense of indignation among public opinion.
“The Court finds that, after placing under the preventive measure of judicial control, the restrictive measure of freedom but not deprivation of liberty, under the impact of the accused attitude, of the families and their local supporters, was felt at the level of the local and national community a strong sense of indignation over the fact that persons accused of serious acts are judged to a lesser extent restrictive and is shown in the motivation of the Vaslui Judgment.
The magistrates also demonstrated the primary defense of the seven defendants who during the process invoked that the girl they raped would not be held by the church and
“The Court underlines that it is lacking the moral quality of the injured person, the aspect that the defendants have wanted to highlight through the defences they have formulated, since the physical and sexual freedom of a person cannot be violated under any pretext and is further specified in motivation.
Corbyn, Brexit and the Future of Europe
From economic and demographic causes, the prosperity enjoyed over the last ten years can no longer continue in the following years.
Until Saturday probably wins the world in Romania who is Jeremy Corbyn.
Even today, after he became the new leader of the Labour Party in the United Kingdom, and he wonders to what extent we can affect the choice of a politician who, after all, is not in a position of decision.
Jeremy Corbyn is the most radical leftist leader of post-war laborers.
Marxist declared, anti-monarchist (at one point he asked Tony Blair, then prime minister, to take out the royal family from Buckingham Palace), a fierce anti-American and a sympathizer of Vladimir Putin (he was also regularly invited to comment on political events by the television channel “Russia Today and, as well as the Hizbollah and Hamas terrorist movements, he wants Britain to resign nuclear weapons and to leave NATO and the EU.
For Corbyn, who at that time considered the murder of Osama bin Laden as a real tragedy, ISIS is almost preferred to the United States.
Following the model of all demagogues of the populace, Corbyn, of course, has a miraculous anti-austerity solution.
Things like the ones you said you promised Tsipras in Greece until he broke up with the real world and economic legities.
The economic programme of the new Labour Leader includes, among other things, massive renationalisations and the printing of money as a solution for financing development projects and covering very generous social benefits.
Of course, some might wonder why money-printing solutions are not unanimous on the world, we would then have global overall prosperity!, but who else would prevent such details.
Of course, we can tax blood on bankers, become some sort of left-wing servants, but from what has been seen so many times in the past, not only in the former communist states or in Ecuador or Venezuela, but also in France, at the beginning of Mitterand and Hollande's mandates.
Additional amounts are quickly swallowed by generous, uncovered promises made by the demagogues of the populace.
As Margaret Thatcher rightly pointed out, \"socialism's problem is that at some point other people's money ends
A few people give Jeremy Corbyn the real chance to ever become prime minister.
In the early 1980s another radical leftist leader, Michael Foot, who was not as extremely convinced as the fresh leader of the party, failed sadly in the elections.
And then there is still a working class in Britain, in the classical sense of the word, relatively consistent and structured.
And the unions were more sensitive than now.
Under the conditions of the new industrial landscape, where services are dominant throughout the workforce, and extended automations have made the industry require massive, highly skilled labour, Corbyn's rhetoric has a limited appeal.
But even from the opposition, he can influence important developments that can directly affect us.
In its final financial issue Times considers that Corbyn's election increases Brexit's chances, namely the exit of Great Britain from the EU.
The new Labour Leader was a consistent opponent of the country's membership in the Union.
In the radical left-wing eyes Brussels is the agent of international capitalism and a promoter of globalization that imposed austerity on the poor.
When you combine this kind of ideas with those expressed by the radical right, with anti-imgracy rhetoric and look at the refugee crisis that is shaking from the EU's foundations you reach an explosive mix.
And not just for Britain.
However, if the British decide after the referendum, which would take place until 2017, to leave the Union to lose symbolic capital for the whole European project and the deep failures created within it of the Euro crisis and now to refugees, between North and South, between East and West, leave room for the most worrying scenarios.
As much as for a whole series of Member States, London was a counterweight to the Franco-German axis (in which, however, Berlin becomes more and more the dominant actor).
It is true, the British business environment, City, are powerful lawyers for the country's stay in the EU.
But Europe today is no longer that of the past.
There's a lot of resentment that's growing in intensity right now.
The problem is that Brussels, even recently we had a sample in Jean Clude Junker's speech, tends increasingly to make major decisions over the heads of the large majority of Member States by consulting with just a few European powers, mainly Germany.
And that happens in conditions where electoral support for anti-sistem, anti-imgracy formations that are at the same time and Euroseptics grow spectacular across the continent.
In other words, the negative emotional climate has reached higher rates than ever before.
From where I know the conclusion that the Financial Times is drawing when assessing Brexit's chances.
The pro-EU option is based on a cold calculation that leaves the national interest.
If the voters take the brain decision, then Britain will remain in the EU.
But Corbyn's victory reminds us of the power of emotion in today's politics.
Eastern Europe can be significantly affected by such major developments.
Especially if, as expected, we will be witnessing a more pronounced integration of the euro area, which will push most of the countries in the region to the periphery of interest and to that of the decision-making process in Europe.
Corbyn, Tsipras and Syriza in Greece, Podemos in Spain, even Bernie Sanders in the United States feed on the popular rhetoric of the frustrations accumulated in Western societies.
From economic and demographic causes, the prosperity enjoyed over the last ten years, the generous social benefits, can no longer continue the same in the years to come.
Under the explosive pressure of the dual crisis, the Euro-immigration zone, both caused by hasty decisions that have taken only the integrationist political ambitions, does not know the ability and willingness of peoples and governments in Europe to respond to such challenges, turbulence on the continent, the internal tensions in the EU will increase in intensity and may affect the situation of Romania most.
And it's hard to exclude anything from the possible scenarios.
The question is whether our main political leaders are in a position to deal with such complicated situations.
Constantine Brancush, the Gentile God.
Rockefeller: “How can I help you?
Brochures: “You sweep the workshop”
The great sculptor had a great dream: to be someone, to become famous, to hear about him all over the world.
Behind his reputation, however, something is almost forgotten today, when millions of successful stories are delivered to us, recorded for the success of life.
That thing has a name.
The name of the certificate shall be read in the Annex to this Regulation.
What about Constantin Brancăci?
What else is to say, actually?
His figure showed up on the banknotes.
And recently, a well-known bank in Romania hired an actor to play it in an ad clip.
The cheese production delivers money to almost 60 years since it's not among us anymore.
In Romania, there are hundreds of streets of boulevards bearing his name.
On the other hand, even the author of this text lives on one of these streets.
And when he comes out with the odrasla, he hears the following instructions: \"We're going to the park, to the Brâncăti and
The country is driven by its statues.
There are several Romanian personalities whose works are known from so many people, from children, to elderly people.
The infiltration capacity of Brancu and is a huge city.
Neither did the communities succeed in removing it from Romania's memory and culture.
His quotes are now pushing the internet, receiving hundreds of thousands of likes and shares.
And then, again, what else would be said, to write about this man?
Look at the pile of books and articles that try to reconstruct his destiny, the life of Brancu and it seems almost fantastic, totally unlikely.
You know, there are those people who tell you that if you haven't had the luck to be born in some big city and in a family as soon as you know, your chances of success in life are almost zero.
The life of Brancu and is the perfect counterexample.
And maybe here would be a key.
Maybe from here the text that follows should be started.
With a sentence, as detestable as these are.
Look at the stories of stupid success, which are delivered to you every day in newspapers and on television.
Look carefully at the figure of this man.
Do you want to know how he managed in life, how, today, he heard a whole map of the world?
It's simple.
He's worked his whole life to be someone.
That's what he did.
Constantin Brâncu and was born on 19 February 1876 in Hobiti, a small village in the municipality of Peşeni, Gorj County, at the foot of Carpathians.
He is the fifth child of Mary and of Radu Nicolae Brancuda.
Although it came from a wealthy peasant family, Brâncu and leads a modest life, but one of which had to collect its landmarks that will guide his late artistic vision.
Remembering her childhood and the places she grew up in, the artist had to confess, in a meeting with Petre the city, from Paris, in 1933: “By then life was beautiful and harmonious and
For thousands, people were taking, happy, a patriarchal life.
Everything went smoothly from one season to another.
And so why did things change?
The civilization of the great and has reached us.
The childhood of the Brancus was, however, far from an idyllic one.
One of the moments spent in these early years of life is highly suggestive of the combination of purity and violence that characterized the future sculptor of the years spent in the hometown.
The time is reproduced in the work \"Branchs. A biography and written by Alexandru Buican.
In 1879, Constantine Brancu and was 3 years old.
In the fall of that year, when the cassant was made easy and followed by those who tasted the liquid to see if the process was going properly, Brancu caught a moment of general unattendedness.
It fills your palms with doorbell and drinks on unsealed.
She falls into her sleep almost instantly.
The first people just notice after a few minutes.
Mom panics, then in hysteria, believing her son died.
In the evening, when Radu, his father, returns from the life accompanied by the lautari, he sees from far away the desperate signs of those who await him with their soul in their mouths.
The party is immediately transformed into jales.
The father is already thinking about burial.
However, someone finds it okay to call Baba Brand and Dophoroae and servants of the Brâncuts.
And they check the baby's breath, and then they put it under the horse's whale nose, gathered around.
The kid's sneezing hard.
The world applauds.
While the boy is let to sleep on drink, for joy, the bachelor party continues with even more force.
The next day, father and son meet through the livery.
Radu Brancu and make Constantin gather some knots and bring them to them.
The father holds his child with his head down and, with the noodles brought by the boy, beats him to remember.
And while he feels the tightness of the blows, the Little White has revealed that the world can be looked at from another perspective and that things around can appear turned around.
Especially the sun's position, unlike the well-known one, makes him wonder, as he would recognize the old and, if not himself, the star participates in his disorder.
Have the sun been as troubled as his father as it had happened to him?.

A parliamentary calls on politicians to remind themselves of those who voted for them.
Independent MEP Viorel Blăju called on the PSD and PNL to stop internal fighting and reorient their agenda to the electorate.
What we see now on our political stage is such a great breakdown.
I haven't seen anything from the 2012 USL projects to continue.
No highways, no Regional Emergency Hospitals, just see how politicians dispute their possible locations depending on their real estate interests.
Let's get a little out of politics, get together and talk.
At the present time, the file doesn't work.
\"If you're busy with the internal war, you don't have time for those who chose you and said Blaju and.
He appreciated that the current political class disproved the Scottish electorate, the consequence being a very small presence in future local elections, around the figure of 30%, representing practically the loyal electorate of the parties.
The Member also considers that the voters will be oriented towards traditional parties, expressing their reservation to new political initiatives, such as the \"Pentru Iaşti\" Party, which will be launched today.
Local parties have very small chances and will only break out of the right electorate, not of the PSD.
Such parties are based on active civic people, who are usually right-wing.
\"It spreads and more right, which is not good for anyone, nor for the PSD and said Blaju and.
He stated that he was not interested in a candidacy at future local elections, dismissing the rumors about his intention to join the Primière race.
I said I don't want to run any local functions.
I'm still thinking about whether to continue as a Member and in the future mandate.
I've been trying to appeal to the unit for Iga and the talks on the halls, with the other parliamentarians, and I've been accused that I want to make my image.
I don't want to, but we can't continue.
“If people voted for us, it doesn’t mean they’re stupid to vote if they don’t see anything and said Blăju and, which appreciated that the main reason the electorate is no longer interested in politics is the hypocrisy of the presidents.
A fellow from the village said he wasn't getting the money and he had to go with the bus.
Let's not be hypocrites.
There's no money you know.
Sometimes I'm ashamed to pick up the cash.
At the end of the term of office I will report on everything I have spent, other than the salaries employed from the firm and its maintenance.
It happened to rise in a month and 30,000 lei, with all transport, accommodation and other accounts.
\"Telling a parliamentman that he doesn't get his money is hypocrisy and he's done Blăju and.
