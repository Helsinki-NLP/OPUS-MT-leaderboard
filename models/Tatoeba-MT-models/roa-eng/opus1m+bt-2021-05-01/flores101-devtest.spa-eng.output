In addition to confirming that at least some dinosaurs were feathery, a theory already widespread, it also offers specific data that fossils generally do not offer, such as their color and their three-dimensional structure.
According to the experts, this animal has a brown pen in the upper area and a pale or carotenoid hue in the bottom.
The find also allows a better understanding of the evolution of birds' feathers.
Since dinosaur plumage does not have a well-developed axis, called raquis, but it does present other features of feathers (certs and barbules), the researchers concluded that the raquis are likely to be the result of a subsequent evolutionary development of these other characteristics.
The structure presented by the plumage suggests that its function was not related to the flight, but was used to regulate the temperature or as an indicator of it. The researchers argue that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the analyzed sample presents traits of an adult's plumage rather than a chicken.
The experts’ appreciations were that, even when it comes to the tail of a short-age dinosaur, the sample illustrates more the plumage of an adult than that of a chicken.

When compared with the use of infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), it was determined that the composition of the crystals coincides with that found in the urine of the affected pets.
I don't know if they've noticed it or not, but most of the products from Central America came to this country free of taxes.
Even so, the countries of Central America recorded with tariffs eighty percent of the products we produced. We treat them to you.
It seemed to me that that made no sense; it was definitely not fair.
All I'm telling people is that you treat us the same way we treat you.
A bill was issued by the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, who does not allow to sell or rent violent video games to minors.
The bill provides that violent video games sold in the state of California must be labeled with a calcomania with the legend \"18\" and penalizes their sale to minors with a fine of $1,000 for non-compliance.
The Director of the Attorney General's Office, Kier Starmer QC, made a statement this morning informing that Huhne and Pryce would be brought to trial.

Edgar Veguilla was injured in the arm and jaw, while for Kristoffer Schneider a facial reconstruction surgery was needed.
Uka's weapon stuck as he pointed towards the head of a fifth man. Schneider suffers permanent pain, does not come with one of his eyes, he misses a part of the skull and his face must have been rebuilt with titanium.
Schneider testified through a virtual link from a United States Air Force base in his country of origin.
Carpanedo participated in two individual championship races apart from the competition of Wednesday.
The first was the slalom, in which he obtained a \"He didn't finish the first race\", as did 36 of the 116 participants in that race.
In his other career, the giant slalon, obtained the tenth place in the female group of seats with a combined execution time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes behind the first Austrian finalist, Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes below the ninth finalist, Gyöngyi Dani, of Hungary.

At first, he was transferred to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Then he was transferred to the Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in the Edinburgh County Court, charged with the murder of her son.
While she is in custody pending prosecution and trial, any statement of an eye witness may be questionable, since her image has been widely disseminated.
It is a common practice in other regions of the United Kingdom, but since Scottish justice works otherwise, the courts considered the publication of photographs as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee said: “It seems that journalists are walking on dangerous terrain when they publish pictures or other information of suspects.”
The Office of the Crown, which is responsible for prosecutions, told journalists that no additional comments would be made at least until the processing car is dictated.
According to the information that was filtered, the document will deal with the border conflict, which Palestine intends to resolve on the basis of the existing limits in advance of the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics that were also addressed, as reported, include the future state of Jerusalem, which both nations consider sacred, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a constant military presence in the valley for ten years once the agreement is signed, while PA only accepts five.
During the complementary pest control test, the wardens were to monitor the shooters closely, as they were monitored and assessed for their effectiveness.
In a union between NPWS and the Association of Sports Shooters of Australia (NSW) Inc., suitable volunteers were recruited within the hunting program of the Association of Sports Shooters.
Mick O'Flynn, who is temporarily in charge of the NPWS Park Conservation and Heritage Office, noted that comprehensive safety and training training was provided to the four chosen shooters for the shooting operation.
On yesterday's day, Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members.
In four years, it's Martelly's fifth CEP.
Last month, a presidential commission advised that the previous CEP should give up, in the framework of a series of measures that seek to lead the country to new elections.
The commission was the way Martelly responded to the widespread demonstrations that started in October against the regime.
The demonstrations, sometimes violent, were caused by the fact that elections were not conducted, in some cases since 2011.
Nearly 60 cases of iPods have been reported with problems of operation and excessive warming, resulting in six fires and resulting in burns of less than four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economics, Trade and Industry (METI) reported that 27 accidents involving these devices were reported.

The Pacific Tsunami Alert Centre also reported the absence of tsunami indicators.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former police officer from that country kidnapped a bus and held tourists coming from Hong Kong captive.
Rolando Mendoza opened fire with his M16 against foreign visitors.
Several hostages have been rescued and so far it has been confirmed that at least six have died.
Both the six hostages, including children and elders, and Philippine photographers, were released early.
Later, the photographers took the place of an old woman because she needed to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was flabbergasted.
Liggins followed the same path as his father and began to study medicine.
He was trained in obstetrics and joined the Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
Liggins began his research on premature delivery in his spare time while working at the hospital.
His study showed that fetal pulmonary maturation of the baby could be agility through the administration of a hormone.
Xinhua reported that on Wednesday the government researchers managed to retrieve the flight recorders from the black box.
Luna’s fellow fighters also paid tribute to him.
Tommy Dreamer said: \"Mona was the first queen of the Extreme. She missed the night of the two moons, something unique, like her. A strong woman.\"
Dustin Oro in Polvo Runnels stated: “The moon was as rare as I; even more, I love it and I will miss it. I hope it is in a better place.”
Since 2008, among the 1400 polled prior to the 2010 federal elections, there has been an 8% increase in those who oppose Australia becoming a republic.
Julia Gillard, Acting Prime Minister, held, during the 2010 federal election campaign, that she believed that Australia should become a republic once Queen Isabel II's mandate was completed.
34% of respondents share this vision and want Isabel II to be the last queen in Australia.
At one end of the survey, there are 29% of people who believe that Australia should become one republic as soon as possible; in the other, 31% who believe that it should never do so.
The Olympic winner of the gold medal was to swim in the free style of 100 meters and 200 meters, and in three highlights in the Commonwealth Games, but his physical condition has been put into doubt because of his complaints.
Medicines could not be taken to relieve pain, because their use in the Games is prohibited.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Misuri, discovered the greatest prime number that has ever been known.
Many people checked the finding through the use of various types of hardware and software and at the beginning of February and made himself known on Tuesday.
The comets may have served as a source of water for our planet, as well as organic matter, which has the ability to form proteins and sustain life.
The scientists’ expectation is to understand how planets originate, especially ours, as comets starved on Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, took over as governor at the beginning of the year and last month signed a bill that allows people of equal sex to marry.
He called the rumors 'political talk and nonsense'.
It is speculated that it will be presented to the presidential elections in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, would reduce the distances from the air routes, which would save millions of gallons of fuel per year, as well as carbon emissions.
It employs satellite technology, in contrast to the old terrestrial radar technology, in order to enable air traffic controllers to detect aircraft more accurately and provide more accurate data to pilots.
Additional transport will not be implemented and trains will not be stopped at Wembley. Parking for cars and deterrence will not be available.
Because of the concern generated by the possible lack of transportation, the possibility of the game being held behind closed doors, without the fans of the team.
On Thursday, Science magazine released an investigation that reported the emergence of a new species of bird in Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Experts from Princeton University, U.S.A., and Uppsala University, Sweden, reported that the new species managed to evolve in just two generations, even though it was estimated that it would take much longer, due to the reproduction between an endemic Darwin pine, strong Geospiza, and a migrant cactus paint, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can take all kinds of forms and roll in tiny figures.
Not only can you hammer and roll in sheets, but it is also possible to stretch it until you achieve a very fine wire that can twist and braid.
It can become very thin and adhere to another metal. It is such thinness that it can be achieved that it used to decorate the illustrations made by hand in books called \"lighted manuscripts\".
This is called pH of a chemical substance. You can develop a pH indicator using red cabbage juice.
The colour of the cabbage juice will be changed depending on how acid or basic (alkaline) the chemical substance.
The number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) present in the analyzed chemical determines their pH level.
Hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron. Therefore, a hydrogen ion is the result of disposing of a proton from its electron.
Shake both dry powders together and, after doing so, with the hands sanitized and wet, squeeze them to form a ball.
A reaction will occur between the moisture in their hands and their outer layers, which will feel strange to the touch and form a sort of caparazo.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets with discharge in almost all the houses, which connected with a sophisticated drain system.
In some homes in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece, traces of sewage systems were found.
They also had health facilities in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, the public baths had toilets and some were shared by men and women.
When you communicate with someone who is thousands of miles away, you are making use of a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back almost instantly.
The satellite was sent to space through a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space, as the light of Earth's atmosphere distorts part of the light and view we have.
A giant rocket, more than 100 feet high, is needed to be able to carry a satellite or telescope to outer space.
The wheel has modified the world in amazing ways. The most relevant thing it has done for us was to provide a much simpler and faster transport.
Thanks to her today we have many means of transport, such as rail or car, among many others.
Below, there are more moderate-sized cats that feed on medium prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (which include independent domestic cats) that feed on small species that exist in much more numbers, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of its success is the concept of niche: each feline has a particular function, which prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most socialized cats and their lives take place within large groups called herds.
The herds are made up of one to three adult males of the same family group, joined with up to thirty females and their offspring.
Females usually relate closely to each other, making them a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion herds have the same behavior as wolves or dogs, with whom they keep a surprising similarity (in contrast to other big cats) both in their conduct and in which they are highly lethal to their prey.
Athlete integral, the tiger has the ability to climb (but not too well), swim, give extensive jumps and jail five times stronger than a robust person.
The tiger is of the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These are the only four cats able to emit wrinkles.
The tiger is not a fully sounding roar like that of the lion, but, rather, like a prayer of words spoken to grunts and screams.
The birds enjoy feeding on small creatures. As far as possible, they will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all their prey will have a much smaller size than theirs.
Scientists believe that the birds trace and find animals to eat (pets) through the smell, smelling the soil where they have passed.
They have very good night vision and in dark places and also move very stealthyly. The birds hunt their prey mimeizing with their surroundings and then swing over them.
When a small group of living creatures (a small population) departs from the main one they come from (e.g., if they move to a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily get back) they will often find themselves in a different environment than they used to be.
The new environment has different resources and competitors and, therefore, a new population will need different characteristics or adaptations than it had before to be a strong competitor.
There have been no changes in the original population, which still need the same adaptations as in the past.
As time passes, as the incipient population adapts to the new environment, it begins to resemble the other population less and less.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that it will not be possible to catalog them as of the same species.
This process receives the name of speciation, which simply means the development of new species, and is an inevitable consequence and fundamental part of evolution.
Plants generate the oxygen that people breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide they exhale (which they dismiss).
The food of the plants is generated with solar energy, thanks to photosynthesis. In addition, they offer shade.
We build our houses from plants and with them we also manufacture clothes. Most of the foods we ingest are plants. Without them, the animals would not survive.
The Mosaicaurus was the alpha predator of his time, therefore, to nothing feared, except others of his own species.
His long jaws had embedded more than 70 sharp teeth like razors, in addition to another additional group in the palate, which translates into that anything that passed before him, had no escape.
We don't have security, but we could have had viperine. His diet included turtles, large fish, other mustards and even could have been a cannibal.
He also attacked any creature who entered the water: not even a dinosaur as huge as the T. Rex was a threat to him.
While most of that food would be quite familiar to us, the Romans also ate certain unconventional items at banquets, such as wild boars, real turkeys, snails and even a type of rodent, the liron.
Another thing that differed was that humble people and women ate sitting in a chair, while the acquiesces enjoyed sharing banquets and standing aside while eating.
It is not possible that the recipes of ancient Rome included food that arrived in Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
Verbigracy, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa and no Roman of old ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a central temple considered their home.
People carried sacrifices for the gods and priests sought to meet the needs of those celebrating ceremonies and festivals.
The temples have an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary to which only priests could enter.
On occasion, special towers were built in pyramidal form, called zigurats, to form part of the temples.
The top of the tower constituted a special sanctuary for his deity.
In the midst of the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was of no greater importance.
The Hebrew families spent most of their time outdoors.
The women cooked in the yard; the shops were just displayrs that hit the street. The houses were built with stone.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests; therefore, wood was extremely expensive.
Very few people lived in Greenland. According to Nordic sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, during a journey that took more westward, discovered the island and gave it its name.
Even so, without prejudice to their discovery, the Eskimo tribes already lived the place for that time.
While each country separately was \"scandinavian\", there were marked differences in relation to the people, monarchs, habits and history between Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the National Treasure film, you may believe that a treasure map was drawn in the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. While the reverse of the document contains something written, it is not a treasure map.
The Declaration of Independence has in its reverse the phrase ‘Original Declaration of Independence of 4 July 1776’. The text appears in the bottom of the document, face down.
Although it is unknown to certain science who wrote it, it is known that it was barely made, the huge parchment document (size 293-4 inches per 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up to be saved.
Therefore, the annotation is likely to have been added just like a label.
Although the landings carried out during Day D, as well as subsequent clashes, had achieved the liberation of northern France, still remained the southern side.
His government was in the hands of the French of \"Vichy\", which were a group that, in 1940, had agreed peace with the Germans and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the so-called “Dragon Operation” was deployed, through which the Allies invaded southern France.
In just two weeks, the American forces and those of Free France had achieved the liberation of southern France and were still on their way to Germany.
A civilization can be defined as a specific culture from which an extensive group of people live and work together, that is, a society.
The term civilization derives from the Latin civilis, which means civil, and is related to both the civil word, the same language, which means citizen, as with civilians, whose meaning is the city or city state and which, in addition, determines in some way the size of society.
The state cities are the forerunners of the nations. A culture of civilization carries a long generational transmission of knowledge, a lasting cultural legacy and a homogeneous spread.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical traces, and cannot be recognized as civilizations themselves.
During the War of the Revolution, the thirteen states formed, in principle, a central government that was weak under the Articles of Confederation, in which the congress was its only component.
Congress did not have the power to set taxes and, since it had a national executive or judicial power, that function rested with the authorities of the states, which often did not cooperate to enforce all their laws.
Nor was he empowered to annul tax laws or tariffs between states.
The articles called for the unanimous approval of all states to proceed with their amendment and the states gave so little importance to the central government that their representatives were usually absent.
The Italian national football team, together with the German team, is the second most successful team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the sports that are most practiced are football, basketball, volleyball, waterpolo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice jockey, jockeying on skates and the racing of Formula 1.
Winter sports have more popularity in the northern areas, with athletes participating in international tournaments and Olympic events.
In Japan there are about 7,000 islands (the largest one is Honshu), which makes it the seventh largest archipelago in the globe.
Due to the conglomerate/group of islands that it contains, reference is usually made to Japan as a “archipelago”, from a geographical point of view.
The history of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when the sailors of Europe who sailed the place registered the name of the island as Formosa Island, that is, beautiful island.
The establishment, in 1624, by the Dutch East Indies Company, of a base in the southwest Taiwanese, started a transformation into the Aboriginal method of grain production, with the use of Chinese labour to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
The army of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the northern and western coastal region of Taiwan in 1683 and declared the latter as dependent province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after being defeated during the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), Qing's government acceded to the treaty of Shimonoseki, through which it relinquished Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan, which retained its control over the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three capital buildings: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Three Windows.
Most buildings have been rebuilt at the ends of the complex so that tourists can see how they originally worked.
By 1976 it had already been restored thirty percent of Machu Picchu and the works continue today.
To exemplify, the most common fixed image format at the global level is 35 mm, which was the most used film size towards the end of the analogue film era.
Today it continues to occur, but the most important thing is that its dimensional relationship was transferred to the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
Indeed, the 35 mm format is somewhat confusing, as its measurements are 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
This is why it is said that the dimensional ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to calculate the simplest integer ratio) is 3:2.
Many typical formats (verbigracy, the APS format group) are equal or closely similar to this aspect ratio.
The rule of the thirds, which has been the object of constant mockery and often ridiculed, is a simple pattern that generates dynamism while allowing to give certain order to the images.
Indicates that the most effective position where to place the central object is the intersection that forms between horizontal and vertical lines that divide the image into thirds (see example).
During this phase of the history of Europe, the Catholic Church, which had accumulated wealth and power, was questioned.
For more than one millennium, Christianity had succeeded in uniting the European states despite its different languages and customs.
His power, present everywhere, affected everyone, from the monarch to the plebe.
One of the most important principles of Christianity is that wealth must be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's funds are reserved for that specific function.
The church's central dome had remained in Rome for more than a millennium and this concentration of power and money made many wonder if this principle was being respected.
As soon as hostilities were unleashed, the British began a naval blockade in Germany.
While the strategy, which involved the interruption of vital military and civilian supplies, was successful, it violated international law widely recognized and covered in several international agreements of the past two centuries.
Great Britain extracted international waters into whole sectors of the ocean to block the entry of ships, placing at risk, even, to neutral vessels.
Having received a reduced response against this tactic, Germany was thinking of a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine war.
Throughout the 1920s, the attitude adopted by most citizens and nations was that of pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities that had occurred during World War I, countries wanted to prevent that situation from recurring in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the U.S. to take a job at Edison's company in New York.
He arrived in the U.S. with 4 cents, a book of poems and a note of recommendation made by Charles Batchelor (his manager in his last job) and directed to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of delimiting the different periods of time. Each stage or family in power constituted a different dynasty.
Among each dynasty, there was also a period of instability, with split provinces. The best known was that of the Three Kingdoms, which developed over 60 years, between the Hhan dynasty and Jin.
During these stages, a fierce war broke out among many nobles who disputed the throne.
One of the bloodiest periods in the history of Antigua China was that of The Three Kingdoms, where thousands of people died in a struggle to occupy the throne of the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many political and social consequences, such as the use of the metric system, the displacement of absolutism towards republicanism, nationalism and the conviction that the country belongs to the people, and not to just one sovereign.
Also, after the Revolution, the posts were open to all male candidates, which allowed the success of the most ambitious and prestigious.
The same is true of the military, since, instead of basing the army's charges on classes, they are now based on the caliber.
The French Revolution was also a source of inspiration for many other people of the repressed working class from other countries to face their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in issues beyond this worldly life. He used to visit a cave that became known as \"Hira\" in the mountain of \"Noor\" (light) to reflect.
The cave itself, which lasted in time, illustrates the spiritual inclinations of Muhammad in a very realistic way.
In the back of one of the mountains north of Mecca, lies a cave totally abstract from the rest of the planet.
Indeed, it is very difficult to find, even if one was sure of its existence. Inside the cave, isolation is total.
Nothing can be seen more than the wonderful clear sky and the numerous mountains of the surroundings. From the inside of this cave, you can see or hear very little of this world.
Of the seven wonders, the only one still standing is the Great Pyramid of Guiza.
The Great Pyramid, raised by the Egyptian people in the third century B.C., is one of so many pyramidal and large-sized structures built to venerate the dead pharaoh.
The Mass of Guiza, or \"Necropolis of Guiza\", in the Valley of the Dead, in Egypt, contains numerous pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, temples, and the great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many others of this type, tombs and smaller temples rose in honor of their wives and family.
The 'arch up' mark resembles a V and the 'arch down' mark is similar to a staple or square without its lower edge.
Above means that you should start at the tip and push the bow, and down means that you should start at the frog, where the hand holds the bow, and pull from it.
The upward motion of the bow generates a smoother sound, as a descendant is stronger and tasant.
Feel free to make your own marks with pencil, but do not forget that the marks in the bow instruments have been printed there for a musical purpose and should therefore be respected.
On 6 October 1789, a crowd of women from the market forced the terrified monarch Luis XVI, Maria Antonieta, her two little children (María Teresa, eleven years old and Luis Carlos, four) and the king's sister, Madam Elizabeth, to return to Paris from Versailles.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd shouting and throwing threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and the queen to open the windows of her carriage completely.
At one point, a member of the revolt shook the head of a royal guard executed in Versailles in front of the queen, who was panicking.
The Philippine people themselves paid the war costs of U.S. imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime in order to solve most of the expenses and interests of the bonds that fluctuated on behalf of the Philippine government at Wall Street banks.
From now on, the super-gains derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Philippine people would constitute the main gains of American imperialism.
In order to understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that led to the establishment of the order.
The European historical period in which these events are situated is commonly known as the Middle Ages, between the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (i.e. between 1000 and 1300 AD).
The Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which, by convention, ended about 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept that comprises, pragmatically, a great range of ideas, from the technological impulse or imperative to a strict sense that there is an underlying logic that drives the fate of humanity and that relates to the laws of science and how they are shaped in technology.
Almost all interpretations of technological determinism have in common two general ideas: that technological development itself is manifested by a path independent of any cultural or political influence and that, at the same time, technology has \"effects\" in societies that are inherent and not socially conditioned.
To give an example, one might argue that the existence of automobiles necessarily derives from the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a reduced volume of automobiles, thus designing new manufacturing techniques to reduce the costs of owning a vehicle.
Massive use of automobiles also generates a greater incidence in transit accidents, leading to the development of new techniques in the field of health to repair damaged bodies.
The element of cultural determinism was very present in romanticism, according to scholars such as Goether, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped people and, over time, customs and cultures related to this geography developed, which, while in harmony with the location of that society, were preferable to laws imposed arbitrarily.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion city today, Constantinople was considered such in feudal Europe.
Its fame of being an epicenter of luxury began in approximately 400 BC and extended to approximately 1100 AD.
During the 12th century, their status declined, especially because, upon their return, the Crusaders brought gifts, such as silks and spices, to which goods offered in Byzantine markets were given greater value.
The title of \"capital of fashion\" has since been passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The gothic-style peak took place in the period between the X-XI and XIV centuries.
At first, the way of dress was greatly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slowness of communication channels, Western styles could lead to a delay of about 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop a style of its own. One of the most significant advances of that time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people began using buttons to abrogate their garments.
Subsistence agriculture is defined as the objective of which is to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family group exclusively.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple practice, usually organic, that combines the use of stored seeds originating in the ecological region with crop rotation or other comparatively simple methods to maximize production.
Historically, much of the main activity of farmers was subsistence agriculture, which continues to be practised in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals with similar ideas and feelings of marginalization by social standards and provide them with the possibility of generating a sense of identity.
There are many factors that can distinguish from subcultures: age, ethnicity, class, location or gender of its members.
The traits that distinguish a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, sexual, geographical, or related to religion or politics, or a mixture of factors.
It is common for members of a subculture to exhibit traits of their belonging to it by resorting to the distinctive and symbolic use of style, such as fashions, gestures and jargon.
One of the most commonly used mechanisms to graph the importance of socio-abilizing is to analyze the few and regrettable cases of children who, due to neglect, misfortune or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults during their growth.
These children are nicknamed “savages”. Some wild children are confined by people, in general their parents. In some cases, the abandonment of a child is due to the rejection of parents to the serious intellectual or physical disability of the child.
Wild children may have suffered traumatic situations or serious child abuse before they were abandoned or fled.
Others are said to have been raised by animals and some have lived on their own in the wild world.
When the wild child is created exclusively by animals other than humans, it presents behaviors (within its physical possibilities) almost in a whole equal to those of the specific animal that cared for it, as well as its fear or indifference towards people.
Even though project-based learning should facilitate that process and make it more interesting, scaffolding goes a little further.
The scaffolding is not a learning technique; it is, first of all, an assistance that provides support to those experiencing a new experience, such as the use of a new computer program or the start of a new project.
The scaffolding can be presented in both real and virtual format; to say it otherwise, a teacher is a type of scaffold, but it is also the small animated clipboard of Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is embedded in the software and its function is to question, stimulate or explain procedures that may have proved to be complex for the student alone.
Children in foster care are welcomed for a wide range of reasons, from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment where there is no affection, care and education; but it happens.
We can see that the family reception system provides a safe environment for these children.
The goal of our foster care system is to provide safe homes, loving tutors, sustained education and reliable medical care.
The aim of family care is to cover all needs that were not met in the home from which they were previously collected.
The Internet combines and blends components of mass communication and between people.
The different features presented by the Internet open up new dimensions from the perspective of the concept of uses and rewards.
For example, “learning” and “socialisation” are identified as significant incentives for the use of the Internet (James et al. 1995).
During a study of user reactions to Eighmey and McCord (1998) websites, \"personal participation\" and \"durable relationships\" were also detected as new motivational factors.
Through video recording, there have been important findings in the interpretation of mycorexpressions, which are movements on the face of only a few milliseconds of duration.
Specifically, it is argued that, through the proper reading of their microexpressions, it is possible to detect if a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The president's speech explained how those who cannot understand speech due to brain damage can, however, evaluate sincerity accurately.
It even suggests that the skills to interpret human behavior can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
Through the research work of the 20th century it has been shown that there are two groups of genetic variation: the occult and the manifest.
The mutation process incorporates a new genetic variation; the selection process removes this set of variations.
Segregation and recombination bar the variation between one and another generation after generation.
In the savanna, it is not easy for a primate, whose digestive system is equal to human, to satisfy its amino acid needs with the plant resources it has.
Furthermore, not doing so brings serious problems: slowing down growth, malnutrition and, ultimately, death.
Proteins present in leaves and legumes had been the source of simpler plant resources, but they are not easily digestible for primates like us, except that they are cooked.
In contrast, feed derived from animals (hormigas, termites, eggs) is easy to digest while providing a large number of proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
Ultimately, we should not be surprised if our own predecessors resolved their \"protein problems\" in the same way as the chimpanzees of the savanna today.
The sleep interruption consists of intentionally waking up during the normal period of sleep and sleeping after a while (10 to 60 minutes).
This can easily be achieved with a more or less smooth alarm clock that makes it return to a conscious state, although not fully awake.
Registration is an additional requirement for the visa process. In some countries, you will have to register your presence and address your accommodation with local authorities.
Other options based on biological rhythm consist of drinking a lot of liquid (especially water or tea, known as diuretic) before bedtime, which will force you to get up to urinate.
The level of inner peace enjoyed by a person is in contrast to the amount of tension in his or her body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the force of life we have. Each of us has the potential to find peace and absolutes.
We can all achieve enlightenment. The only thing that hinders the path is our tension and negativity.
Although the bases of Tibetan Buddhism are Buddha's teachings, they spread through the path of Mahayana love and numerous techniques of Indian yoga.
In general terms, laism is very simple. It is based on kundalini yoga, meditation and the way of love that all encompass it.
In Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (lighting) is activated with yoga positions, breathing practices, mantras or visualizations.
Tibetan meditation focuses on the Devata Yoga. Through the visualization of different deities, energy channels can be disabling, chakras are activated and awareness of enlightenment is developed.
Cooperation between the USSR and the US was the result of facing a common enemy, Germany, during World War II. After the war, shocks of system, process and culture ended up distancing the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, those who were now allies were enemies and the Cold War began.
It would be extended for the next 40 years and would be really fought, through substitute militias, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, among many other places.
Because by 17 September 1939 the Polish defence was already broken, his only hope was to withdraw and reorganize in the extension of the Romanian bridge head.
However, these plans fell into disuse almost one day for another, when more than 800,000 fighters from the Soviet Red Army entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-aggression Pact and other international, bilateral and multilateral agreements.
Using ships to transport goods is a much more effective way to move large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
The role of the Navy has always been to ensure that its country retains the power to move its population and goods, while at the same time interfering with the enemy's ability to do the same.
The North Atlantic campaign in World War II offers one of the clearest and most recent examples of this. Americans tried to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean in order to support Britain.
At the same time, the German army, mainly using submersibles, tried to cancel this circulation.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany could have taken power in Britain, just as it did with the other European countries.
Apparently, the goats were domesticated, for the first time, some 10,000 years ago, in the Zagros Mountains, in Iran.
In order to easily obtain their milk, hair, flesh and leather, the ancient peoples and tribes began to stay with them.
Domestic goats were usually gathered in herds that wandered along the hills or other grazing areas, often cared for by goat herders who used to be children or adolescents, similar to the most popular shepherd. These pastoral methods are still being used today.
In England, railways had already been installed in the 16th century.
Even though the rails of the carts were made of simple parallel wooden boards, they allowed the horses that had flown from them to achieve a greater speed and drag heavier loads than on the slightly more slippery roads of the day.
The incorporation of sleeping to keep the rieles in place occurred rather early. However, gradually, they realized that the riles would be more efficient if they were iron coated at their top.
This became a common practice, although iron caused greater wear on the wheels of the wagons, made of wood.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced with other made of iron and, in 1767, massive iron rhieles began to be used.
The first form of transportation that was known was walking. The human being began to do so in a position erected two million years ago with the appearance of the Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not have the habit of walking erect.
Although bipedestration trails have been found in Australopitec fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, the Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs 7 million years ago.
We can begin to lead a more friendly life with the planet, become part of environmental movements, or even we can become activists and fight to minimize, to some extent, future suffering.
It is, in many cases, like asymptomatic treatment, but if you are not just looking for a temporary situation, we should find the root of the problems and try to disable them.
It is clear that the world has undergone great changes, a product of the technological and scientific advances of humanity, and the problems have intensified because of the overcrowding and the extravagant lifestyle of people.
After being approved by Congress on 4 July, a draft written by hand was sent and signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and the secretary, Charles Thomson, to John Dunlap's printer, a few streets away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as the Dunlap Copies.
It was John Nixon who first read the document and did it in the courtyard of the Independence Hall on July 8.
On July 6, a copy was sent to George Washington, who ordered that his army be read in New York on July 9th, and another copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 photographs of Dunlap, which are known to still exist, are the oldest preserved copies of the document. The original manuscript has been lost.
A lot of paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today. It's the birds.
Many people do not represent them as dinosaurs, as they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are many characteristics in birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
They have scattered extremities and claws, lay eggs and move on their back legs like the T-Rex.
Currently, almost all computers operate on the basis of the manipulation of coded data under the binary system.
A binary number can only have one of two values, they are 0 and 1 and, according to the computer jargon, these numbers are known as binary digits, or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately evident. Its symptoms, such as vomiting, are too common to be able to give an immediate diagnosis.
The most clear indicator of internal poisoning can be found with an open jar of medicines or toxic chemical cleaning products.
Read the label for specific information on the first aid relevant for that specific poison.
Entomologists use the term parasitic insect in a formal sense to refer to this group of arthropods.
The word comes from its old relationship with the Chinese, a species very developed to parasitize humans.
Assassin and bed chinches are nests; they are adapted to inhabit the nest or home of their host.
The registered cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the U.S. amount to about 400,000, making it the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
The central nervous system, brain binding, spinal cord and optic nerve, is the object of multiple sclerosis attack.
Studies indicated that women are twice as likely as men to suffer from MS.
A couple might conclude that raising a baby would not be the most convenient thing for them or the child.
These couples could choose to plan the adoption of a baby.
In an adoption, biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that a different couple can take over the child.
The key objective of science is to decipher the way the world works through the scientific method. Indeed, this method serves as a guide for most scientific research.
However, it is not an experiment, it is a test that is used to rule out one or more of the possible hypotheses, asking questions and observations that guide scientific research.
The focus of both naturalists and philosophers was placed in classical works; especially, in the Latin version of the Bible text.
Aristotle's thoughts, especially the questions of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As the rule of the Greek language decayed, the West distanced itself from its Greek roots, both philosophical and scientific.
Often, many rhythms present in physiological processes and behavior depend decisively on internal cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not only about reactions to regular external stimuli, have been recorded in almost all living beings, including in bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks oscillate in a self-sustaining way and have a period of free cyclic operation, even if there are no external stimuli.
One of the key indicators that DNA consisted of a genetic material was the experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase inserted their own DNA into a bacterium using phages, or viruses.
They performed two experiments in which they marked the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or DNA protein with radioactive sulphur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the chunk of affected genetic material and whether it involves germ cells, the mutation may have various effects.
Only germ cell mutations can be transmitted to children, while those occurring elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism often attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, which includes wildlife and plant life.
Some examples of possible activities in the place include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks, and studying ecosystem information.
One example is to visit, take pictures and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in their cars to go to their jobs and usually cross with others whose jobs are in the place where they have just left.
In this dynamic transfer shuttle, everyone is somehow connected with a transport system based on the use of private cars, and they support it.
Currently, scientists claim that this massive carbon economy has deprived the biosphere of one of its regular states that has contributed to the evolution of humanity for the past two million years.
They are all part of society and make use of transport systems; and almost all complain about them.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridge collapse.
What is the reason that transport systems give rise to complaints of such a size and why do faults occur daily? Are transport engineers simply incapable? Or is there anything more substantial that is happening?
The traffic flow is the study of the individual movement of drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, it is not a simple task to study the flow of traffic, as it is not possible to make accurate predictions about the behavior of drivers.
Fortunately, there is a tendency in drivers to maintain a relatively consistent behaviour, allowing traffic flows to have a logical consistency and can be the object of approximate mathematical representation.
In order to more clearly graph the flow of circulation, relations were established between the three most important elements: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships facilitate both planning and design and operation of road devices.
The first species to fly were insects. This helped them avoid their enemies more easily and find food and couple more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold the wings back, sticking them to the sides of the body.
This provides them with a larger fan of possible small places to hide from predators.
Currently, anisoptians and efemeropters are the only insects unable to fold their wings.
Millenniums ago, a man named Aristarchus commented that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
There were those who shared their theory, but many others believed the opposite: that the solar system orbited the Earth, even the Sun and other stars.
This seems to make sense, since on Earth your movement is not perceived, right?
The Amazon River is the most caudal and second most extensive of the planet. It contains 8 times more water than the river that follows it in size.
In addition, the Amazon is the widest river on the planet, at some points with an amplitude of up to six miles.
Of the total water coming from the rivers of the world that flows into the oceans, 20 percent is derived from the Amazon.
The Great Amazon River has an extension of 6387 km (3980 miles) and receives water of thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, it was never able to overcome those of Guiza, either in size or in the sublime of the technique of its building.
The ancient Egyptian people of the New Empire were amazed at the monuments of their ancestors, who at that time dated more than a millennium.
With approximately 800 inhabitants, Vatican City is the smallest independent country in the world and the smallest in population.
Italian is used in Vatican City, both to draft its rules and to issue its official communiqués.
The language spoken daily by most of those working within the state is also Italian and the use of Latin is generally reserved for religious ceremonies.
All citizens living in Vatican City subscribe to Roman Catholic religion.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper are known from ancient times, since all of them can be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with rudimentary tools.
Philosopher Aristotle developed the theory that everything is made up of a combination of one or more of four elements: land, water, air and fire.
This kept more similarity to the states of matter (with identical order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, only that, at the same time, had the theory that they are transformed into new substances that make up the things we see.
The alloys are basically a combination of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table has many elements.
Metals are considered to be elements such as calcium and potassium. Since now, there are also metals of the type of gold and silver.
There may also be alloys with small amounts of elements, such as carbon, which are not metallic.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter, composed of small particles called atoms.
The size of the atoms is so impressively tiny that the end point of this sentence could contain trillions of them.
So when it was invented, the pencil won many friends.
Unfortunately, as a result of the implementation of new writing methods, the pencil is used less and has lost its status.
Today, people write messages on the screens of their computers. They don’t even need to get close to a staple.
You just have to wonder what the keyboard will be like when something new comes up.
The atomic bomb operates on the principle that energy is required to form a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons.
It is similar to what happens when rolling a heavy cart up a hill. By dividing the core once again, it releases part of that energy.
The nuclei of some atoms are unstable, i.e. they tend to break down with a minimum or almost no push.
The surface of the moon consists of rocks and dust and its outer layer is called bark.
The bark is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km away.
It is thinner under the lunar and thicker seas under the highlands.
There may be more seas on the near side because of the thinness of the bark, which made it easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on looking for what is what attracts or likes people.
These doctrines hold that people have certain needs or desires that have been internalized as they grew to maturity.
These theories analyze what causes certain people to want the things they do and what factors in their environment force them to do or not to do certain things.
Two well-known theories are that of the hierarchy of needs, of Maslow, and that of the two factors, of Hertzberg.
In general, two types of behavior can be given when managers start leading their former companions. On one side of the spectrum, it is the attempt to continue being \"one of the boys\" (or girls).
Managers in this category are concerned with making decisions that harm employees, imposing disciplinary measures, conducting performance assessments, assigning responsibilities and requiring accountability to staff.
At the other end of the spectrum, it moves into an unrecognizable person who believes it necessary to modify everything that has so far been doing the group and doing so in its own way.
In the end, the ultimate responsibility for the success and failure of the team is the leader.
This way of behavior often ends by distanceing the leaders from the other members of the team.
The same standards of excellence that conventional equipment handle apply to virtuals, although there are small differences.
Often, members of a virtual team operate as a contact point for their nearest physical group.
They generally enjoy greater autonomy than the members of a traditional group, thanks to the fact that it is possible for their teams to meet in accordance with different time zones that, for example, might not be understood by local management.
The existence of a real ‘invisible team’ (Larson and LaFasto, 1989 p. 109) is also an exclusive element of virtual equipment.
The “invisible team” is the management group and the one that each member reports to, which sets the standards for each member.
What could be the reason for an organization to submit to the applicant process of establishing a learning organization? One of the purposes of applying the theoretical concepts of organizational learning is to drive innovation.
When all available resources are used appropriately in the operational departments of an organization, there is room for creativity and ingenuity.
As a result, it is possible that the process of an organization working as a team to overcome a difficulty of place to a new innovative process in order to meet the needs of customers.
In order for an organization to be innovative, leadership must first generate a culture of innovation, as must shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide factual evidence for a theoretical approach to cognition research, thus reducing the field of research and giving it greater accuracy.
The correlation between brain pathology and conduct contributes to the research of scientists.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in mental functions.
Thanks to the uproar of new technologies, we have the possibility of seeing and investigating structures and processes that occur in the brain that have never been seen before.
This provides us with abundant information and material to develop simulation models, which favor our understanding of mental processes.
While artificial intelligence is closely associated with science fiction, it is a speciality of great importance within computer science, which deals with behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
AI research involves the development of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behaviour.
Examples of this include monitoring, planning and programming, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and consultations, as well as facial, writing, and voice recognition.
These issues have become separate disciplines, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The Artificial Intelligence system is now often used in the sectors of the economy, medicine, engineering and militia, in the same way that it was incorporated into various applications of video games and personal computers software.
Study trips are an important part of every classroom. It is very common for a teacher to want to take his students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
The solution comes from the hands of technology, through virtual excursions. Students can observe the objects displayed in a museum, visit an aquarium or contemplate beautiful works of art sitting with their class.
Sharing a tour in a virtual form is also an excellent way to reflect on an exit and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital and every year the page is updated, but the previous versions are kept online that in the form of a souvenir album.
Blogs can also help to improve the writing of students. Even when students often start their blog experience with a careless grammar and spelling, this usually changes in the presence of an audience.
Because students are usually the most critical readers, the blog writer begins to strive to improve his writing, in order to avoid criticism.
In addition, the blog \"requires students to be more understanding than the world around them.\" The need to revive the interest of the audience inspires them to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a resource that inspires collaboration and encourages students to deepen their learning beyond the typical school day.
The proper use of blogs \"can empower students to be more analytical and critical, through the active response to internet content, they can define their positions in the context of the writings of others, as well as establish their perspectives on specific issues\" (Orave, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's captivating bilingual capital and has a variety of museums and art galleries that exhibit the country's history and current history.
Niagara cataracts are located further south and the north houses the unexploded natural beauty of Muskoka and the extension that follows it.
All these aspects, among others, highlight Ontario as intrinsically Canadian in the eyes of foreigners.
The larger areas farther north are sparsely populated and some are wild, almost uninhabited land.
To make a population comparison that causes great surprise to many: in the United States live more African Americans than Canadians.
The location of the islands of East Africa is opposite the east coast of that continent, in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is, by far, the largest and one continent in itself if we talk about wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or associated with France and are popular for their luxury beaches and tourist complexes.
Islam was also taken to the lands by the Arabs and imposed, to a large extent, in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The initial tip of European influence and colonialism took place in the 15th century, following the discovery, by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama, of the route that unites the Cape of Europe with India.
The region limits with the Sahel to the north, and with the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: All female visitors are advised to say that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It will also be useful to use a ring (just try not to look too expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences can cause what they consider harassment, and that it is not uncommon for them to be followed, taken by the arm, etc.
Whether it is round by rejecting men and not theme to defend their position (there are cultural differences or not, that is not correct!).
The founders of the modern city of Casablanca were the Berber fishermen during the X century B.C. and the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenidas used it as a strategic port, called Anfa.
It was destroyed and rebuilt by the Portuguese under the name of White House, but in 1755 they abandoned it after the advent of an earthquake.
The city was rebuilt by order of the Moroccan sultan with the name of Daru l-Badya and the Spanish merchants who installed their businesses there called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of Morocco's most boring shopping sites.
In the vicinity of the ancient Medina, there are plenty of places where traditional Moroccan items are sold, such as clay pots, ceramics, leather products, water pipes and a whole range of berries, although everything is prepared for tourists.
Goma is a tourist point in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, on the eastern border, near Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma and left much of its streets submerged, especially in the city centre.
While Goma is quite safe, any visit abroad must be considered in order to learn about the situation of the clashes that persist in the North Kivu province.
In turn, the city is the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and its mountain gorilla sighting excursions are the cheapest in Africa.
To move into Goma, you can choose to take a wedding-boda (mototaxi). The regular (local) rate is CDF500 (congolese francs) for a short trip.
This, in addition to what is relatively inaccessible, has given ‘Tombuctú’ an image of exotic and distant land.
Although today Tombuctu is an impoverished city, it still has an airport and its reputation makes it a tourist attraction.
In 1990, it was incorporated into the list of places of humanity's heritage at risk, a product of the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the most important stops of the Special Wonders of the African World, by Henry Louis Gates, in PBS.
The city is very much in contrast with the rest of the country, as it has a more Arab than African style.
Kruger National Park (PNK) is located in the north-east of South Africa and extends along the border with Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north and Crocodile River in the south.
The park has an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, in each of which a different wildlife is developed.
This is one of South Africa's most important attractions and is recognized as the main icon of South Africa's National Parks (SANParks).
As in all natural reserves in South Africa, there are daily rates for conservation and access to the park.
It may also be convenient to buy a Wild Card that allows you to access selections of parks in South Africa or all the National Parks of the country.
The territory of Hong Kong takes the name of the homonymous island, which is the destination most tourists consider the main attraction.
The deployment of buildings delimiting the horizon of Hong Kong has been compared to a luminous bar graph that is evidenced by the presence of the waters of Puerto Victoria.
The way to enjoy the best views of Hong Kong is to get out of the island and head to the Kowloon shore, located in front.
It is on the land recovered from the north coast of Hong Kong where its urban development is concentrated, densely.
This is the site that British conquerors adopted as their own. Therefore, if you want to see evidence of the colonial past of this region, it is a convenient place to start.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest range of coastal mangroves, with a length of 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
UNESCO has declared its heritage to the Sundarbans. The section of the forest within the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
Without prejudice to this, forests are not just mangroves, but possess some of the last trees left from the imposing jungles that ever covered the Gangetic plain.
Sundarbans comprises an area of 3850 km2 and about a third of its extent is covered by water or swampy areas.
The Sundarbans have been, since 1966, a temple of wildlife and it is estimated that there are currently 400 real tigers in Bengal area and some 30,000 moped deer.
Buses leave the station between districts (on the other side of the river) all day, although most, especially those traveling east and Jakar (also called Bumthang), leave between 6:30 and 7:30 p.m.
Because buses between districts are often full of passengers, it is advisable to purchase a ticket with a few days in advance.
Almost all districts have the service Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and resistant.
Sharing a taxi trip is an agile and convenient way to move to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrums) and Punakha (200 ngultrums).
The Oyapock River Bridge is an attractive structure that crosses it, connecting Oiapoque, Brazilian city, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 m, with a length of 378 m and two 3.5 m wide lanes.
Under the bridge there is a free space of 15 meters and, although its construction was completed in August 2011, it was not enabled for transit until March 2017.
The full operation of the bridge is estimated for September 2017, which is for when it is expected to end Brazilian customs controls.
The area currently east of Paraguay was inhabited by the Guarani, who were the most important indigenous group in that region and who lived as semi-mapped hunters, as well as the practice of subsistence agriculture.
The region had other Aboriginal groups, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who hunted, collected and fished as a means of livelihood.
Paraguay, formerly known as \"The Giant Province of Indias\", was born in the 16th century, as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and native indigenous peoples.
The Spanish began the colonization stage, which extended for three centuries.
Since Asunción was established in 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve much of its idiosyncrasy and Aboriginal identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best teams and the best polo players worldwide.
The most important tournament of the year takes place in December in the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Other tournaments and lower matches can also be seen in other parts of the year.
On the site of the Argentine Polo Association you will get information about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo parties.
The value of the Malvinas pound (FKP), the official currency of the Malvinas Islands, is fixed in equivalence with the British (GBP).
There's only one bank on the islands. There you can change your money. It's in front of the FIC West store in Stanley.
Pounds are usually accepted anywhere inside the islands. In Stanley, you can also pay with credit cards or U.S. dollars.
There are chances that credit cards are not accepted on the islands of the periphery, but it could use British or American money. Ask the owners in advance to be able to define what the accepted payment method is.
It is practically impossible to change money from the Malvinas Islands outside the archipelago, so try to do it before leaving.
Because Montevideo is located south of Ecuador, it is summer there when in the northern hemisphere it is winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, with frequent temperatures greater than +30°C during the summer.
The winter cold can be misleading: although it is very rare that temperatures are below the freezing point, the wind and humidity interact to make it feel colder than the thermometer points.
There are no stations specifically ‘rainy’ or ‘dry’; the amount of rain remains almost the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing people, wild life is still wild, so there is no need to feed it or disturb it.
According to park authorities, at least 100 yards/metres away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/metres from the rest of wild animals should be kept.
Without prejudice to how meek they can shine, the fact is that bisons, huapatians, mooses, bears and virtually all large animals can be aggressive.
Dozens of visitors suffer injuries each year because they do not keep a proper distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially wild; therefore, they respect their space.
Also, remember that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so you should avoid having or cooking foods that release much aroma and keep cleaning in the camp.
The capital of Samoa, the city of Apia is located on the island of Upulu and has just less than 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, the port was the scene of a disastrous naval confrontation when seven German, American and English ships refused to leave the port.
All the boats, except a British cruiser, were loaded, and nearly two hundred U.S. and German individuals died.
During the war for the independence of the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city resulted in the murder of the head of state Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are a large number of beaches, because Auckland has two ports. The best known are in three areas.
In the North Harbour district, in the Pacific Ocean, there are the beaches of North Shore, which range from Long Bay, in the north, to Devonport, in the south.
The beaches are almost all of sand with safe swimming places and mostly have pohutukawa trees that offer shade places.
In the port of Waitemataas the beaches of Tamaki Drive, in the extravagant neighborhoods of Mission Bay and St Heliers, are spread in the central region of Auckland.
These are family beaches, sometimes very crowded, with numerous and varied shops available on the thing. They are also safe to swim.
Number One is the most popular local beer and is not complex, but rather pleasant and refreshing. The other regional beer is Manta.
While there is a wide variety of French wines, those from New Zealand and Australia could be considered better for transport.
Local tap water is completely safe for consumption, but, if you are concerned, you can easily find water in bottle.
Australians consider the notion of coffee “white flat”. A black boy coffee is called “spresso”, cappuccino is served with cream (in place of foam) and tea is not taken with milk.
Hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but delicious.
There are numerous trips to the reef all year round, and there the wounds for any of these causes are rare.
However, accept the advice of the authorities, respect all signals and pay special attention to security alerts.
Cubomedusas are located near the beaches and estuaries of the rivers from October to April, to the north of 1770. Sometimes they can be found outside this time.
Sharks do exist, but they almost never attack people. Most of them are afraid of them and would drift away by swimming.
The ocean is not the place where saltwater crocodiles actively reside. Their primary habitat are estuaries of rivers located north of Rockhampton.
The accommodation reservation in advance of the trip gives you the tranquility that you will have a place to sleep when you arrive at your destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although it is also possible to book another type of accommodation, such as camp areas.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transfers from and to the airport, and even combined flight and accommodation packages.
You can also save the reservation if you need time to think more about the offer, or to get other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any modification or request must be made through the travel agent in the first place, not directly through the hotel.
In some festivals, most of those who attend musical events decide to camp in the place and most of the spectators consider it a crucial aspect of the experience.
If you want to see the action closely, then you must arrive early at the camp to make yourself with a place close to the musical events.
It should be borne in mind that, while musical performances may have ended, in other areas of the festival they could continue up to high hours of the morning.

Anyone who proposes to drive at high latitudes or in mountain steps must foresee the possibility of snow, ice or low temperatures.
On roads with ice or snow, there is little friction, so it is not possible to drive as it does on the bare asphalt.
During snowstorms a amount of snow can fall so that it gets trapped in very little time.
In addition, visibility can be reduced by snow or by condensation or ice formed in the windows of the car.
On the other hand, in many countries ice and snow conditions are normal and transit flows almost without interruption throughout the year.
Safaris are likely to be Africa's greatest tourist attraction and the most memorable part for many visitors.
The popular use of the term Safari refers to land travel to see Africa's amazing wildlife, particularly in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often approach vehicles and standard equipment will make a good vision possible.
On occasion, lions, ghépards and leopards can be shy, so you will have more opportunity to observe them using binoculars.

Not all filters have the same effectiveness and, if this concerns you, you should consider buying bottled water with seal from a certified company.
It may occur that travelers are topped with pests of animals that are not known in the regions from which they come.
Plagues are able to ruin food, cause irritation or, in more serious cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases, alone, or dangerous animals, which can injure or kill individuals by using their strength, are not usually included in the category of pests.
The free purchase of customs taxes offers an opportunity to purchase, in certain places, goods without taxes and taxes on consumption.

In the Buffalo-Pittsburgh motorway, the section between Point Marion and Fairmont is one of the most challenging management conditions and often runs isolated and isolated terrains.
If you do not usually drive on rural roads, be alert: there are many pronounced slopes, narrow lanes and closed curves.
The established speed limits are notoriously lower than in the previous sections and in which they follow them, usually from 35 to 40 mph (56-64 km/h), and their strict compliance is even more important than in any other section.
Interestingly, however, the cellular signal is much better here than in many other sections of the road such as Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastry is of good quality and, in Bavaria, cakes are quite tasty and varied, similar to those they prepare in Austria, their southern neighbor.
Fruit cakes are common, with apples cooked inside them throughout the year and cherry and plums appearing in the summer.

The rigs are the supports for the feet of the riders that hang on both sides of the mounting chair.
While providing greater stability to the rider, they can present safety problems, as their feet may be stuck in them.
If a rider is fired from the horse, but he has a stipulating foot on the strip, he can be dragged if the animal escapes. To reduce the risk, there is a series of safety collections.
First of all, most riders use taco-mount boots that have a ready and fairly narrow sole.
In addition, there are mounts, especially the English, with safety bars that allow the skin of the widget to emerge from its structure if a rider who leaves fired pulls back.
The Cochamó Valley is the most popular climber destination in Chile and is known as the Yosemite in South America, with a variety of extensive walls and granite risks.

Snow sports in decline, such as skiing and tablekeeping, are popular disciplines that consist of sliding with skis or a table fixed to the feet, on a snowy terrain.
Skiing is a main travel activity with many adherents, sometimes called \"ski lovers\", who organize their holiday entirely based on skiing on a specific site.
The idea of skiing is very old, as there are cave paintings representing skiers and going back about 5,000 BCE.
As a discipline, the alpine ski dates from not after the 17th century. In 1861 the Norwegians inaugurated the first ski recreational club in Australia.
Ski backpack: also known as a rural skiing, hiking or hiking skiing.
While binding, it generally does not involve practicing hiking skiing or alpine-style mountaineering, developed on pronounced slope floors and with much more rigid skiing and footwear.

Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean managing visa applications and passport controls several times.
However, the Schengen area functions as a single country in this respect.
Generally, as long as it moves within this region it will be able to cross the borders without going through a passport checkpoint again.
Similarly, when you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to manage permits for each of the member countries of this space separately, which will save you time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal criterion that determines when a manufactured good can be considered an age. Some tax agencies have established that objects over 100 years old are antiques.
The definition varies geographically, where the age limit could be more sewn at sites such as North America than in Europe.
It may occur that the handcrafted products are catalogued as antiques, even though they are newer than goods of similar characteristics manufactured in series.
The breeding of reindeer is a fundamental means of life between the Lapland and the culture related to that trade activity is important for many who are dedicated to other professions.
Even so, even traditionally, not all Lapones have devoted themselves to large-scale reindeer breeding, but have lived from fishing, hunting and other similar activities, using reindeer mainly as traction animals.
Today, many Lapland are working in modern commercial activities. Tourism represents an important income in Lapland, the Sami region.

Return currents are the flow that flows back from the waves that break on the shore, often in a reef or similar.
Because of the underwater topology, the return flow meets in certain areas of greater depth and there can be a rapid flow towards deep waters.

As soon as I escape the current, swimming back will not be more complex than usual.
Try to reach somewhere where I can't reach it again, or if you have the skills and someone has seen it, it might be convenient to wait for them to rescue you.
The impact of returning home occurs before culture (there is no ‘moon of honey’ happiness), it takes more time to go and can be harder.
Travelers who have been easy to adapt to a new culture sometimes have many difficulties in adapting to their native culture.
When you return to your home after living abroad, you will have adapted to that new culture and you will have lost some of the habits of your native culture.

People may not predict that tolerance and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning to their homes.

Others include Livingston Island and Deception, where there is a spectacular natural port made up of the flooded boiler of a volcano that remains active.
The Ellsworth Land, whose boundaries are defined by the Bellingshausen Sea, is a region that is located south of the peninsula.
In this place, the mountains of the Peninsula mix with the plateau and then resurgence to make up the 360 km mountain range of the Ellsworth Mountains, fractioned in two by the Minnesota glacier.
In the northern sector, Sentinel mountain range, there are the highest peaks of Antarctica, the Vinson Macizo, with a summit at 4892 metres on Mount Vinson.
In remote locations, where cell phone coverage does not reach, a satellite device could be your only option.
A satellite phone cannot be equated to a mobile phone, because, in order to make a call, it must be outdoors and with a clear line of vision towards the satellite.
The service is usually used in water transport, including recreational boats, as well as for expeditions requiring remote data and voice.
You can consult with your local telephone service provider for more information on how to join this service.
Combining travel and learning has become a very popular option among those who plan to take a sabbatical year.
This is very popular among graduates, since it allows them to take a year off before the university without risking their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a study programme abroad for a sabbatical year may, in fact, increase the chances of access to higher education once it returns to the country of origin.
Normally, a registration fee will be charged to register in these educational programs.
Finland is an excellent destination for sailing: the “land of the thousand lakes” also has thousands of islands, both in lakes and in coastal archipelagos.
A yacht is not always needed in the archipelagos and lakes.
Although coastal archipelagos and the most caudal lakes are large enough for any yacht, smaller vessels or even a kayak offer a different experience.

They are paid very well to couriers for making fast deliveries. Often, time is very important when it comes to commercial documents, goods or spare parts for urgent repairs.
Large companies have their own aircraft on some routes, but there was a problem for smaller companies and other routes.
If they made an airfleet shipment, some routes may have taken days to discharge and customs.
The only option to do so faster was to send it as billed baggage. The airline regulations prohibit carrying luggage without a passenger, and this is where you come into play.
The obvious way to travel in the first class or in the executive class of an aircraft is to spend a fortune for that privilege (or, what is best, make your company pay for you).
But this has a price: in general terms, you can get to pay up to four times the economic rate in business class and up to eleven in class.
It's usually silly to look for discounts for first class seats or business class on direct flights.
Airlines are well aware that there is a basic group of travellers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of arriving at a site quickly and comfortably, and charging accordingly.

Don't ruin the place by making marks or graphitis in the structures.
Catalan and Spanish are the official languages of Barcelona. About half of its people prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, because Catalan is, legally, the first official language, most of the letters are written only in that language.
Even so, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other buildings.

However, those who speak something Spanish can come to the hasty conclusion that Portuguese is quite similar and that it is unnecessary to study it individually.
At present, premodern observatories have generally become obsolete and continue to function as museums or educational destinations.

It is tradition to spend Easter night sailing somewhere exposed to contemplate the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations of this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
The most traditional churches usually offer a Easter Vigil on Saturday night during the Easter weekend and the congregations usually start the celebrations for the resurrection of Christ just at midnight.
All animals that originally arrived in the islands came to this place swimming, flying or floating.
Because they are far from the continent, mammals were unable to reach there, which made the giant turtle become the main grazing creature in the Galapagos.
