Rapidly progressive cumulative incidence of coronary virus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and in the United Kingdom, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronary virus disease (COVID-19) shows similar trends in the countries of the European Union/European Economic Space and the United Kingdom, confirming that although it is at a different stage depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly advancing in all countries.
Based on the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and ICUs should prepare more for an outbreak of patients with CVID-19 who will need care and mainly intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a portion of cases of unknown etiology pneumonia were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of China reported the causative agent as a new coronavirus, now referred to as coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV-2).
Since then, the disease resulting from SARS-COV-2 infection has been called coronary virus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence so far is that 80% of people with CVID-19 develop a mild form of the disease, that is, an infection of the respiratory tract with or without pneumonia, and most of them recover.
In about 14% of cases, CVID-19 evolves into a more serious disease, requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% evolve into a critical disease, requiring intensive treatment.
The mortality of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we assess trends in the cumulative incidence of VOC-19 in each European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and in the United Kingdom and compare them with those of Hubei Province in China.
We also compare the current number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom with that of Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
After China, the COVID-19 spread geographically, and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world currently follow that country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic.
The 5 March edition of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported the first cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Europe, according to the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in persons returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 15 March 2020, the cases of COVID-19 had already been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom, and between 31 December 2019 and the date mentioned above, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths had been reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths only in Italy.
Obtaining cumulative numbers and cumulative incidence of CVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of reported cases of COVID-19 in each country of the world, obtained only from official sources, such as the Ministry of Health of countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO, is updated every day at 8h.
These data were used to assess the trends of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, and to compare them with those of Italy.
As an approximation of the prevalence of active cases of COVID-19, we calculated the cumulative truncated incidence of 14 days of cases of COVID-19, taking into account, therefore, the natural evolution of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA country and in the United Kingdom, during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also presented the cumulative number of reported cases from each country by 15 March 2020 at 8h, compared with Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
Trends in the cumulative truncated incidence of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom generally followed those of Hubei Province in China (Figure 1).
In general, for the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 started to increase around 21 February and then significantly increased by 28 February 2020 (complementary material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in cases reported in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom showed similar increases in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (complementary material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom compared to Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It points out that by 15 March at 8h, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had already reported a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy 3 weeks or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is rapidly increasing in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
The trends observed in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is progressing at a similar rate in all countries.
This occurs despite countries being at different stages, variations in the actions of the national public health systems and possibly different case definitions in countries and different protocols for the selection of patients to be tested for the confirmation of COVID-19, including testing for updating.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy described a situation where 10% of patients with VOC-19 needed intensive treatment, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on hospitalization by cases of COVID-19 in a hospital and/or an ICU are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data not shown).
However, they should be collected in a systematic way to supplement current surveillance data with a focus on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study conducted between 2010 and 2011 showed a huge variation in the availability of ICU beds and semi-intensive units in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal for every 100,000 people.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (2.5 ICU beds and half-intensive treatment beds for a population of 100,000 people between 2010 and 2011).
Modeled scenarios related to the saturation of the health system capacity, with estimates for each EU/EEE country and for the United Kingdom of the prevalence of cases of COVID-19 hospitalization associated with a risk greater than 90% of the capacity of intensive care beds, are provided in the sixth update of ECDC's rapid risk assessment of COVID-19.
In view of the fact that the cases have so far focused on certain regions of the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom, and hospitals and intensive care units generally serve a defined population of regional coverage, information on cases and intensive treatment beds should be made available preferably in the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistical Purposes 2 (NUTS-2).
Italy's example and trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
Countries, hospitals and ICUs should therefore prepare for a sustained community transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 and for an increase in the number of patients with VOC-19 who will need medical care, mainly intensive care, such as in the affected regions of Italy.
As pointed out in ECDC's rapid risk assessment, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a change in the containment approach to a mitigation approach, since the rapid increase expected in the number of cases may not provide sufficient time for decision makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their actions appropriately, if not implemented in advance.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the epidemic.
There is a small window of opportunity during which countries have the possibility to step up their control initiatives to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on the health system.
If these initiatives fail, health systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to have an outbreak of patients who will need intensive treatment in the coming days or weeks.
The disease epidemic of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by coronary virus disease 2 (SARS-COV-2) of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), has already killed over 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 in China and the rest of the world, resulting in a catastrophe for the population.
Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-COV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-COV-2 could also be transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has lower severity and mortality than SARS, but it is much more transmissive, and affects older people more than young people, and more men than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on the new disease, this article seeks to provide a current and comprehensive assessment of the research object, which develops rapidly.
We will address the basic principles of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and disease prevention.
Although many questions still need answers, we hope that this study will help in the understanding and eradication of this hostile disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 became a unique and unforgettable memory for all Chinese who were forced to be confined to the entire holiday and for several subsequent weeks due to the epidemic of a new viral disease.
The virus is very similar to the coronavirus (COV) that caused an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, it was called SARS-COV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and its disease was called COV-19 disease (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly across the country and almost 50 other countries around the world.
By March 2, 2020, the virus had resulted in more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients recovered and more than 3,000 patients killed.
WHO alerts that COVID-19 is the - public enemy number one - and is potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 articles were published on COVID-19, including its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on 7 January 2020, which determined the sequencing of the isolated virus of several patients.
This article seeks to summarize the progress of research in this new area of rapid development.
Where relevant, we will compare COVID-19 to SARS and the other disease caused by CoV, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, a 2012 epidemic).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far about the prevention and prognosis of the disease, as well as the other urgent issues.
CoVs are traditionally considered non-lethal pathogens to humans, mainly causing about 15% of the common colds.
However, in this century, we have twice found highly pathogenic human COVs, which are SARS-COV and MERS-COV, causing an epidemic originating in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and which soon spread to several other countries with frightening morbidity and mortality.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third CoV epidemic in the documented history of the human being.
As shown in Fig. Fig.1,1, a portion of cases of pneumonia with unknown origins was initially reported in Wuhan, on December 31, 2019, to the China National Health Commission.
Seven days later, the coV sequencing was published.
On 15 January 2020, Wuhan’s first fatal case was reported.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20, the contagion of health professionals was reported, suggesting that transmission among people was possible.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was confined, with all its public transport interrupted.
On January 24, the first clinical study on the disease reported that of 41 patients with confirmed cases only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan Sea Fruit Market, which was considered the starting point of the contagion by an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, WHO declared the epidemic a global health emergency.
By the time of this report, the disease has already spread across China and almost 50 other countries throughout the world (Fig. (Fig.2).
Since the situation is rapidly worsening, the size and the final gravity of the epidemic should still be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a study of several centers with 8,866 patients, including 4,021 patients confirmed with COVID-19, presented a more up-to-date illustration of the epidemic, as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, mainly in the 30-65 age group.
Almost half (47.7%) of the infected were over 50 years old, some were under 20 years old, and only 14 were under 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
The COVID-19 spread in groups, especially in Hubei and its surroundings.
COVID-19 received an average of 5 (2 to 9) days for diagnosis based on the appearance of symptoms.
The mean incubation period was 4.8 (3.0 to 7.2) days.
The mean death time based on the onset of symptoms was 9.5 (4.8 to 13) days.
The basic reproduction number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51 to 4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23 to 4.82.
The number of people infected grew exponentially before January 23, 2020, corresponding to the mass transport time before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality rate of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10% to 1.86%), and the adjusted mortality of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02% to 4.59%).
The three main risk factors for CVID-19 are gender (masculine), age (greater than 60 years) and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of large and encapsulated viruses that contain a single chain of RNA with a certain meaning.
They can be divided into four genera: alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which it is known that alpha-coronaviruses and beta-coronaviruses infect humans.
The glycoprotein spike (S) of the envelope binds to its cell receptors of the angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ECA2) and dipeptidyl peptide 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-COV respectively, and subsequent membrane fusion occurs.
Viral RNA genome is released in the cytoplasm; after viral genome replication, genomic RNA accompanied by encapsulated glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins form vesicles containing viruses, which bind to the plasma membrane and release the virus.
The first sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 genome was reported on 10 January 2020.
It was found that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of betacoronavirus with more than 99.98% genetic identity among 10 sequenced samples collected from the same original site of the outbreak, the Huanan Sea Fruit Market, in Wuhan.
SARS-COV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-COV than MERS-COV.
Through the transmission electron microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles were discovered in ultra-fine sections of the human airway epithelium.
Human ECA2 was found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds to human protein ECA2 in a weaker way than SARS-CoV protein, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a less serious infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
Orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 may perform a function in viral pathogenicity and inhibit IFNβ expression; however, orf8 does not contain any known domain or functional motif.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al., reported the total human length ECA2 cryo-EM structure to the resolution of 2.9 Å in a complex with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
It was found that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was grouped as a dimer, and the ECA2-B0AT1 complex can unite two S proteins, which provides evidence for coV recognition and infection.
B0AT1 may become a therapeutic target for screening medicines to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The host of origin and the intermediary
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats and were transmitted to human beings through civets and camels, respectively.
Through a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-COV-2 with other CoVs, bats were considered the native hosts of SARS-COV-2, since the new virus is 96% identical to two COVs of bat-SL-COVZX45 and bat-SL-COVZX21.
However, the intermediate host who helped the virus cross the barriers of species and infect human beings remains unknown, and the transmission route still needs to be discovered.
Ji, et al., suggests that snakes carry the bat virus to human beings, which involved homologous recombination in protein S.
According to one study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggested that pangolins, elongated seal mammals that feed on ants and are often used in traditional Chinese medicine, are the potential intermediate hosts of SARS-COV-2, based on the genetic homology of 99% between a coV discovered in pangolins and SARS-COV-2.
However, a 1% difference in two genomes is a big difference; therefore, conclusive results for concrete evidence are awaiting (Fig. (Fig.33).
The physical-chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are, for the most part, still unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in dry environment and up to 5 days below 20 °C with humidity of 40% to 50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and 56 °C heat for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol 75%, chlorine disinfectant, peracetic acid, chloroform and other organic solvents, but not chlorhexidine, are efficient in deactivation of the virus.
In general, the entire human population has no immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to the new virus.
Currently, no detailed study has been reported in relation to the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can consult only previous studies on other CoVs, mainly on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. (Fig.4).4).
In general, after a virus invades the host, it is recognized first by the host's innate immune system through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including C-type lectin receptors, Toll-type receptor (TLR), NOD-type receptor (NLR) and RIG-I (RLR) receptor.
Through different routes, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of interferons of type I (IFNs), which limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, SARS-CoV N protein can help the virus escape immune responses.
In a short time, the adaptive immune response joins in the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8+ T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
Collaborating T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to assist in cell defense.
However, CoV can inhibit T cell functions by inducing T cell apoptosis.
Humor immunity, including supplements such as C3a and C5a antibodies, is also essential for combating viral infection.
For example, isolated antibodies from a recovered patient neutralized the MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an exaggerated reaction of the immune system generates a large number of local free radicals that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs and, at worst, multiple organ failure, and even death.
The infection with SARS-CoV-2, characterized by the appearance of symptoms in a group of people, affects the elderly more with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is common for people exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune system is compromised to have a greater chance of being infected than other people.
The estimated mean incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1 to 14 days and, most of the time, 3 to 7 days, based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study on 1,099 cases shows that the incubation period was 3 days, on average, and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, shows that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0 to 7.2) days, based on the demographics of 8,866 cases.
It is essential that health authorities adjust the effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period, thus preventing infected people who do not have symptoms from transmitting the virus to others.
As a current practice, individuals exposed to or infected by the virus usually need to stay quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine period be extended for 24 days?
Fever is usually the initial and main symptom of COVID-19, which can come alone or accompanied by other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, throat pain, chore, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients had dyspnea and/or hypoxemia one week after the onset of symptoms of the disease.
In severe cases, patients quickly evolved into acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and acute fever, even without abnormalities in the diagnosis by lung image, should undergo screening for the virus in order to receive an early diagnosis.
A demographic study at the end of December 2019 showed that the percentages of symptoms were 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnea and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients needed ventilatory support.
Similar results were reported in two recent studies of a family group and a group with transmission of an asymptomatic individual.
In comparison, a demographic study in 2012 showed that patients from MERS-CoV also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnea (55%) as the main symptoms.
However, 80% of the patients needed ventilatory support, much more than the patients of COVID-19, which consists of the higher mortality of MRS compared to COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and throat pain (21%) were also observed in patients with MRS.
In patients with SARS, fever (90% to 100%), dry cough (29% to 75%), dyspnea (40% to 42%), diarrhoea (20% to 25%) and throat pain (13% to 25%) were the main symptoms, and ventilatory support was necessary for approximately 14% to 20% of patients.
By February 14, the mortality rate of COVID-19 was 2%, when the confirmed cases in the world reached 66,576.
Comparably, the mortality of SARS by November 2002 was 10% of 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on a demographic study of June 2012, mortality was 37% of 2,494 confirmed cases.
A more recent study reported that the basic R0 reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 was up to 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI), 5.71 to 7.23, while the SARS-CoV R0 ranged from 2 to 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV regarding its symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The above figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater propagation capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal than the latter two.
Therefore, it is a much greater challenge to control the SARS-COV-2 epidemic than MERS-COV and SARS-COV epidemic.
The appearance of symptoms in a group of people usually occurs in the same family or in the same agglomeration or vehicle, such as a cruise ship.
Patients usually have a history of travel or residency in Wuhan or other affected areas, or contact with infected individuals or patients in the two weeks prior to the onset of symptoms.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus for more than two weeks without symptoms, and cured patients who have been discharged from hospitals can contract the virus again, which generates an alarm for quarantine time to be extended.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of white peripheral blood cells (mainly lymphocytes) at the initial stage.
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cell count below 4 x 109/L including lymphocyte count less than 1 x 109/L, and elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase and viremia were detected in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
The levels of enzymes and myoglobin in the muscles and liver were increased in the blood of some patients, and C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation were increased in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the level of dimer-D, a product of the degradation of fibrin in the blood, was high, and lymphocyte count showed a progressive reduction.
Abnormalities in chest X-rays are present in most patients with COVID-19, and have irregular bilateral shadows or dark glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients generally developed an atypical pneumonia, acute lung damage and acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA).
When SDRA occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis seriously compromise the exchange of gases.
The dysfunction of type-I and type-II pneumocytes decreases the level of surfactant and increases the stress of the surface, thus reducing the ability of the lungs to expand, and increasing the risk of lung collapse.
Therefore, the most severe results of chest X-ray usually correspond to the most severe form of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of VOC-19 demonstrated the breakdown of pneumotics, the formation of the hyalin membrane, the infiltration of interstitial lymphocytes and sincidal cells in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, consistent with the pathology of viral infection and SDRA, and similar to the pathology of patients with SARS and MERS.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA through polymerase chain reaction - reverse transcriptase (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which can accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which became not only derived from RT-PCR) in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation also occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of the history of the disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological results is essential and indispensable to arrive at an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol for the use of the SHERLOCK technique, based on CRISPR, to detect SARS-COV-2, which detects synthetic RNA fragments of SARS-COV-2 in 20 x 10-18 mol/L at 200 x 10-18 mol/L (10 to 100 copies per microliter input) using a measurement rod in less than an hour without the need for a complex instrumentation.
We hope that the new technique can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience, if verified in clinical samples.
Due to the lack of experience with the new COV, physicians can provide, at best, palliative treatment for patients at COVID-19, while at the same time attempting a variety of therapies that were previously used or proposed for the treatment of other COVs such as SARS-COV and MERS-COV and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include current and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma of cured patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Even the plasma of patients who recovered was suggested as treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are running against time to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at the beginning and probably also attacks, to a lesser degree, other organs with the expression of ECA2, such as the gastrointestinal system and the kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and organ failure are the main threats to patients and the main causes of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential to alleviate symptoms and save lives, and includes general oxygenation therapy, high flow oxygenation, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need to receive extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified cardiopulmonary alternative used for the treatment of severe heart failure or respiratory failure.
In addition, the maintenance of electrolytic balance, the prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, and the protection of vital organ functions are also essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It is known that the cytokine cascade results from the exacerbated immune system reaction in patients with SARS and MERS.
Cytocin cascade is a form of systemic inflammatory response, characterized by the release of a series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune system cells to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of SDRA and multiple organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine cascades, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, are being used to treat the cytokine cascade.
Other immunosuppression treatments for the cytokine cascade include the modulation of the T-cell-directed immune response; the blockade of IFN-y, IL-1 and TNF; inhibition of JAK, blinatumomab; suppressor of cytokines 4 signalling; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosuppressants, were widely used to treat SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, steroids at high doses were not beneficial for severe pulmonary injury in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
They can cause severe side effects, mainly avascular osteonecrosis, affecting drastically the prognosis.
However, short periods of treatment with corticosteroids at low to moderate doses were recommended for careful use in patients with CVID-19 seriously ill patients.
At the time this article is written, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, it was found that intravenous administration with remedisive, a nucleotide analogue, was effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead, initially intended for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, remdesivir also demonstrated a possible inhibition of other simple-acting RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on this, Gilead provided the compound for China to perform some tests in individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are being very awaited.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin were suggested as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other drugs used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma of cured patients and antibody generation
The blood collection of patients who have cured from a contagious disease to treat other patients suffering from the same disease, or to protect healthy individuals from the disease's contraction has a long history.
In fact, cured patients usually have a relatively high level of antibodies in the blood against the pathogen.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (lg) produced by B lymphocytes to combat pathogens and other foreign bodies, and they recognize unique molecules in pathogens and neutralize them directly.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who cured from COVID-19, and was injected into 10 patients in a serious state.
Its symptoms improved in 24 hours, with reduced inflammation and viral loads, and improved oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and elucidation are necessary in order to propose the use of the method on a large scale before the development of specific therapies.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some plasma-associated disadvantages should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can stimulate in excess the immune response and cause cytokines release syndrome, which is a potentially fatal toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the demand for plasma is great for treating patients in severe condition.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies with sufficient speed to combat a worldwide epidemic of proportion.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate the B cells from cured patients and identify the genetic codes that encode effective antibodies or do a screening for effective antibodies to essential proteins of the virus.
Thus, we can rapidly increase the production of antibodies.
Traditional Chinese Medicine, MTC, has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases in China.
However, its effects greatly depend on a combination of multiple components in a formula that varies depending on the diagnosis of a disease based on the theories of the CM.
Most effective components remain unknown, or are vague, since it is difficult to extract and verify these components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of specific and effective therapies for COVID-19, MTC has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild or moderate symptoms, or for patients who have recovered from severe stages of the disease.
For example, it was found that Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules are effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The best cure rates for patients with CVID-19 were observed in several provinces in China who used MTC in 87% of patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei Province, who used MTC in only about 30% of patients with COVID-19, obtained the lowest cure rate (13%).
However, this is a difficult comparison, since many impact factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease, should be included in the evaluation.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a comparative study between exclusive treatment with western medicine and the combined treatment of Western medicine with TCM.
It was found that the time needed for the recovery of body temperature, for the disappearance of symptoms and hospitalization were considerably lower in the group treated by Western medicine and by the MTC than only in the group treated by Western medicine.
The rate of worsening of symptoms (from mild to severe) was considerably lower for the group treated by Western medicine and the MTC than for the group treated only by Western medicine (7.4% versus 46.2%), and mortality was lower in the group treated by Western medicine and by the MTC than in the group treated only by Western medicine (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of MTC are still awaiting tests properly controlled at larger scales and in more centres.
It would also be useful to characterize the mechanisms of action and explain the effective components of MTC treatments or their combinations, if possible.
Patients confirmed with COVID-19 or suspected of the disease generally feel great fear of the disease highly contagious and can be fatal, and people in quarantine also feel bored, lonely and irritated.
In addition, symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatments, such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, can increase anxiety and psychological suffering.
In the early phase of the SARS epidemic, several psychiatric morbidities including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitation, psychosis symptoms, delirium and even suicidal tendencies have been reported.
The tracking of contacts and mandatory quarantine, as part of the public health system actions against the COVID-19 epidemic, can make people more anxious, and they may feel guilty about the effects of contagion, quarantine, and stigma imposed on their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to patients with CVID-19, to people suspected of the disease and to people who had contact with them, as well as to the general population, who need it.
Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-COV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid direct contact between people.
Effective vaccines are essential to interrupt the transmission chain of animal reservoirs and infected persons for susceptible hosts, and are generally complementary to antiviral treatment in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Initiatives were taken to develop S-protein-based vaccines to generate powerful and durable neutralizing antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Vaccines were evaluated in animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these vaccine candidates in older individuals and the lethal challenge models and their protection against zoonotic virus infection still need to be determined before the start of a clinical study.
This is probably due to the fact that SARS disappeared 17 years ago and no new case has been reported since.
On the other hand, sporadic cases and MERS focus continue to occur in the Middle East and to spread to other regions, due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies were developed for MERS using inactive viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune individuals is an urgent and essential task for the control of the current epidemic.
However, it is a challenge to overcome the difficulty, due to the long period (18 months, on average) necessary for the development of a vaccine and variations in the dynamics of the CoVs.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to manifest its complete clinical evolution, reaching thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients recover gradually without sequelae.
However, in the same way as SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, building a prognosis model for the disease is essential for health agencies to prioritize their services, especially in areas with scarce resources.
Based on the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients with CVID-19 (Table 33):
Age: age was the most important factor for the prognosis of SARS, which also applies to COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects people between 30 and 65 years of age, with 47.7% of patients over 50 years of age, in a study of 8,866 cases, as described above.
Patients who needed intensive treatment were more likely to present underlying comorbidities and complications, and were significantly older than patients who did not need intensive treatment (mean age 66 versus 51 years), suggesting that age is a prognostic factor for the health outcome of patients with CVID-19.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 men and 0.27/100,000 women), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: patients with CVID-19 who need intensive treatment have a higher chance of acute cardiac injury or arrhythmia.
Cardiac episodes were the leading cause of death in patients with SARS.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also join positive ACE2 colangyocytes, which can lead to liver dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It is important to note that the age and underlying diseases have a strong correlation and may interfere with each other.
abnormal laboratory results: the level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and was proposed as a potential prognostic factor for the disease, response to therapy and final recovery.
The correlation of the PRC level with the severity and prognosis of the VOC-19 was also proposed.
In addition, high lactate hydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and elevated creatine kinase (CK) may also assist in predicting the outcome.
These enzymes are present expressly in various organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Therefore, they are traditional markers for heart or liver disorders.
Major clinical symptoms: chest X-ray and temporal progression of clinical symptoms should be considered together with other questions for the prediction of the outcomes/complications of CVID-19.
Use of steroids: as described above, steroids are immunosuppressants normally used as an attached therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Given that a high dose of corticosteroids was widely used in patients with severe SARS, many survivors suffered from avascular osteonecrosis, with permanent disability and low quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used in a low dosage and for a short period in patients with COVID-19.
Psychological stress: As described above, during the CVID-19 epidemic, many patients suffer from high stress, as they go through long periods of quarantine and uncertainty, and witness the death of loved ones in the family and other patients.
It is essential to provide psychological counseling and long-lasting support to help these patients recover from stress and resume a normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics of SARS characteristics.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can replicate with efficiency in the upper respiratory tract and does not cause symptoms in the initial phase of infection (or cause only mild symptoms), in a similar way to other CoVs that cause common colds.
Therefore, patients infected at the initial or incubation stage can produce a large amount of the virus during their daily activities, causing great difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, it was considered that transmission of SARS-CoV occurs when patients are seriously ill, with most transmissions not occurring in the initial phase.
Therefore, the current epidemic of COVID-19 is much more serious and difficult to control than the SARS epidemic.
Major efforts are currently being made in China, including the confinement of Wuhan and neighboring cities, and the continued quarantine of almost the entire population, in the hope of interrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these actions have drastically affected the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing, indicating the remission of the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the epidemic ends until March, and the deceleration phase lasts between 3 and 4 months.
However, other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimated that COVID-19, which appears to be substantially more infectious than SARS, will not end by 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., established a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 may infect two-thirds of the world's population.
One Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the throat and middle cornet rubble of patients who recovered and were discharged from the hospital in the previous 2 weeks, which indicates that the new virus identified may become an influenza-like cyclic episode.
However, promising indications occurred in China based on the decline in the number of new cases, indicating that current strategies could be working.
It was originally predicted that Ebola would cause up to a million cases, with half a million deaths.
However, with quarantine and strict isolation, the disease was maintained under control at last.
It is possible that SARS-CoV-2, in the same way as SARS-CoV, may become weaker in its infectivity and, at some point, become a less pathogenic virus that coexists with human beings.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with that of SARS and MERS is below (Fig. (Fig.55)).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible by cough and sneezing and possibly by direct contact with virus-contaminated materials.
The virus was also found in feces, which creates a new possibility: that of oral-fecal transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases were possibly caused by nosocomial infections, including 17 patients with underlying diseases and 40 health professionals.
Therefore, greater caution should be taken to protect people, especially health professionals, social workers, family members, workmates and people with direct contact with infected patients or individuals.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is the use of facial masks; the use of surgical masks and respiratory masks N95 (series No 1860s) helps control the spread of the virus.
Surgical facial masks prevent fluid droplets from a potentially infected individual from being transported in the air or being attached to the surfaces of the objects, where they can infect other people.
However, only the N95 masks (series No. 1860s) protect against inhalation of viruses with size of 10 nm to 80 nm, with only 5% of the viruses being able to penetrate it completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size, and the two have approximately 85 nm.
Since particles can penetrate up to five surgical masks together, health professionals in direct contact with patients should use the N95 masks (series No. 1860s), but not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health professionals should use isolation robes to further reduce contact with the virus.
Viruses also infect an individual through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected by SARS-CoV-2, although he was using a N95 mask; the virus could have entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, health professionals should also use transparent facial protectors or protective glasses when caring for patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is highly recommended that all wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, try to stay home in isolation and limit contact with potentially infected people.
One meter is considered an adequate distance to stay away from a patient.
These actions are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-COV-2 has emerged as a new virus for human beings, its high homology to SARS-COV, as reported on January 7, 2020, should have caused a great warning to China, based on its recent history with the SARS epidemic in 2003.
However, only on 19 January 2020, the director of the Wuhan Disease Control Centre reassured citizens that the new virus has a low rate of contagion and limited reproducibility among human beings, and that it was not difficult to prevent and contain the disease.
This message left people more relaxed, especially when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical period for the disease containment in Wuhan on a minimum scale was lost.
Disease control agencies in China can take advantage of this hard lesson and make crucial improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should: (1) be more cautious when making public pronouncements, since everything they say is absorbed by citizens and can influence their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to unusual information from hospitals, rather than waiting for formal reports from doctors and authorities; (3) be more restrictive to contain a potential epidemic at their initial stage, rather than trying to comfort the public; and (4) issue more often targeted and effective simulations to increase public awareness of epidemic diseases and to test and improve the society's response system periodically.
The COVID-19 epidemic caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, it spread throughout China and almost 50 other countries around the world, at the time of writing this text.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV, and the symptoms are also similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 epidemic generated a feeling of SARS' return.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for the containment of the epidemic and the treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects the elderly more than the young, and more men than women, and the severity and mortality rate are also higher in the elderly than in the young.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 transmit the virus when they do not have symptoms, while patients with SARS usually transmit it when they are seriously ill, which causes a greater difficulty in containing the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains, in parts, because SARS-CoV-2 spreads much more rapidly and affects more regions than SARS-CoV.
The regular RNA trial for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, cured patients may receive a positive test for the virus again.
These results dramatically increase the risk of virus propagation.
Given the rapid progress in research on COVID-19, several crucial issues still need to be addressed, as follows:
Where did SARS-COV-2 come from?
Although a 96% genetic homologist was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like COVs, we still cannot conclude that SARS-COV-2 originated in bats.
What animal was the intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original host, from the bat, say, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to questions 1 and 2, we will not be able to cut transmission efficiently, and the epidemic may have a relapse at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ECA2, how exactly does the virus enter respiratory cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to cells with ECA2 expression in the other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot obtain a rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How is the virus genetically evolving during transmission between human beings?
Will it become a worldwide pandemic, disappear like SARS or will it have seasonal recurrence, like the flu?
It is essential, but it may take some time to look for answers to the questions above and to so many others.
However, regardless of the efforts required, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to our normal lives.
Zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have boosted the co-evolution of the coronaviruses (COVs) and their hosts, including human beings, for thousands of years.
Before 2003, it was known that two human coVs (HCoVs) caused a mild disease, such as a common cold.
The epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and respiratory syndrome in the Middle East (MERS) have changed what was thought about the CoVs and revealed how much a HCoV infection can be lethal and devastating.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 put the CoVS in focus again and surprised everyone with their high transmissibility and reduced pathogenicity compared to their brother SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is zoonotic, and understanding the zoonotic origins of HCoVs is of enormous use.
Most HCoVs originated from bats, in which they are non-pathogenic.
The intermediate reservoir hosts of some HCoVs are also known.
The identification of animal hosts has direct implications for the prevention of diseases in humans.
Research into the interactions of the host of the CoV in animals can also provide important information on the pathogenesis of the CoV in humans.
In this study, we present an overview of the existing information on the seven HCoVs, with a focus on the history of its discovery, as well as its zoonotic origins and interspecific transmission.
An important analysis is that we make a comparison and contrast between different HCoVs from a perspective of the evolution of the virus and the recombination of the genome.
The current disease epidemic by CoV 2019 (COVID-19) is discussed in this context.
Furthermore, the requirements for effective transition between hosts and the implications of the evolution of the virus in the severity of the disease are also highlighted.
Coronaviruses (COVs) belong to the Coronaviridae family, which comprises a group of encapsulated viruses, positive polarity and single-stage RNA.
These viruses that have the largest genome, between 26 and 32 kilobases, between RNA viruses were called “CoVs” due to their crown morphology when observed in electron microscopes.
As for the structure, the CoVs have unsegmented genomes that share a similar organization.
About two-thirds of the genome contains two superimposed open-reading structures (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into the polyproteins of replication pp1a and pp1ab.
Polyproteins are transformed again and generate 16 non-structural proteins, known as nsp1 to nsp16.
The remaining portion of the genome contains ORS for structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
Some specific lineage accessory proteins are also coded by different CoVs strains.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, the CoVs are classified into four genera (alphaCoV, betaCoV, gammaCoV and deltaCoV), among which the betaCoV genus contains most of the HCoVs and is subdivided into four strains (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence showed that bats and rodents serve as a genetic source for most alphaCoVs and betaCoVs, while birds are the main reservoir of gammaCoVs and deltaCoVs.
For thousands of years, the CoVs have constantly crossed the barriers of species, and some have become relevant human pathogens.
So far, seven human CoVs (HCOVs) are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alphaCoVs.
The other five betaCoVs include HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronary virus (SARS-COV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-COV) and SARS-COV-2.
HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as a common cold and/or diarrhea.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and newly identified SARS-COV-2 are highly pathogenic and cause severe infection of the lower respiratory tract in a relatively larger number of patients, with a high chance of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDR) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from the coriza of patients with common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been accumulated through comprehensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, the concept that HCoVs infection is generally harmless was widely accepted until the SARS epidemic.
The SARS epidemic that occurred in 2003 is one of the most devastating of today and infected more than 8 thousand people, with a crude mortality rate related to confirmed cases of approximately 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East respiratory syndrome epidemic (MERS) resulted in a persistent epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula, with sporadic spread to the rest of the world.
The new 2019 HCoV (2019-nCoV), which was later renamed SARS-COV-2, is the causer of the current disease epidemic of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which took more than 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people by March 3, 2020.
The alarm is ringing, and the world needs to prepare for the coming SARS-COV-2 pandemic.
All seven HCoVs have zoonotic origin in bats, mice or domestic animals.
Multiple lines of evidence corroborate with the evolutionary origin of all HCoVs from bats, where viruses are well adapted and not pathogenic, but demonstrate great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic presents enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges for China and the rest of the world.
Tracking the zoonotic origins of HCoVs provides a structure to understand the natural history, driving force and restrictive factors of virus migration to other species.
This can also guide and facilitate the search by the host reservoir, intermediate and amplifier of SARS-CoV-2, with important implications for the future prevention of viral migration between species.
In this article, we present an overview of zoonotic origins, interspecific transmission and pathogenesis of HCoVs.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the common theme that the parental viruses of HCoVs are usually non-pathogenic in their natural reservoir hosts, but become pathogenic after the interspecific transmission to a new host.
We also reviewed the trend of evolution of HCoV, in which increased transmissibility has generally been accompanied by decreased pathogenicity.
The outcome of the current SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is also discussed in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the first isolation of HCoV-229E strain from the coriza of patients who contracted common cold, different CoVs had been isolated in several infected animals, including turkey, mice, cow, pig, cat and dog.
In recent decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of the discovery of HCoV in chronological order (Table 1) would be informative and instructive.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, and was subsequently adapted for growth in lineages of WI-38 lung cells.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E had symptoms of common cold, including headache, sneezing, malaise and throat pain, with fever and cough present in 10% to 20% of cases.
Subsequently, in 1967, HCOV-OC43 was isolated from the organ culture and subsequent serial passage in mice' brains during lactation.
The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection seem similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, which are symptomatically indistinguishable from infection by other respiratory tract pathogens, such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed globally, and tend to be predominantly transmitted during the winter season in temperate climates.
In general, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than a week, accompanied by the disease for approximately 2 weeks.
According to a study with human volunteers, healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E developed a common mild cold.
Only a few immunocompromised patients showed severe infection of the lower respiratory tract.
SARS, also known as atypical pneumonia, was the first documented pandemic caused by HCoV in human history, and the etiologic agent is SARS-CoV, the third discovered HCoV.
The first case of SARS dates back to 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 reported cases with 774 deaths, spreading across several countries and continents.
With the exception of super-spallers, it was estimated that each contaminated person can contaminate approximately two other individuals, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days, and with the onset of peak viral load on the tenth day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially have myalgia, headache, fever, malaise and chills, followed by subsequent symptoms of dyspnea, cough and respiratory discomfort.
Lymphopenia, hepatic dysfunction and elevated creatine kinase are the common SARS abnormalities in laboratory tests.
Diffuse alveolar damage, proliferation of epithelial cells and increased number of macrophages are also observed in patients with SARS.
Approximately 20% to 30% of patients at some point require intensive treatment and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs, including gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys, can also be affected in these serious cases, usually with the occurrence of a cytokine cascade, which can be lethal, especially in immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first isolated in a lung biopsy of a relative of the zero patient traveling from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, huge efforts have been devoted to research on HCoV.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7 month-old baby in Holland at the end of 2004.
It was initially found that the virus was prevalent in small children, elderly and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
Symptoms of coriza, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis are common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from an 8-month-old nasal specimen that suffered from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although he has been identified in Holland, he is scattered around the world.
It was estimated that HCoV-NL63 corresponds to approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, and its peak incidence occurs in winter, spring and early summer.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as crupe.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to pneumonia and bronchiolitis acquired in a community manner, it was reported that HCoV-HKU1 was associated with exacerbation of acute asthma.
Similarly to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 was found worldwide, causing mild respiratory diseases.
All four HCoVs acquired in a community manner have adapted well to human beings and are generally less likely to undergo mutation and cause highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred for unknown reasons in the rare case of a more virulent subtype of HCoV-NL63, which has recently been reported as causing serious infection of the lower respiratory tract in China.
In general, when these HCoVs acquire the ability to be transmitted efficiently and to remain continuously in human beings, they also become less virulent and less pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient who developed acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
While most cases confirmed by laboratory originate in the Middle East, cases imported with occasional secondary propagation for close contact were reported in several European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary epidemic occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MRS are similar to those of SARS, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MRS also develop acute renal failure, which is therefore very peculiar to MRS, among the diseases caused by HCoV.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
By February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 cases confirmed by the laboratory were reported with a high mortality rate related to confirmed cases of 34.4%, which made MERS-COV one of the most devastating viruses of human knowledge.
From the end of December 2019, groups of patients with pneumonia, who were subsequently known to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization declared the continuing epidemic of infection of the lower respiratory tract caused by SARS-COV-2 an Emergency of International Importance Public Health and also named the disease COVID-19.
By March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a gross mortality rate related to confirmed cases of 3.4%.
It is noted that the lethality related to the cases confirmed in Hubei, in China, is 4.2%, while the lethality outside this city is 1.2%.
SARS-COV-2 causes severe respiratory infection, in the same way as SARS-COV and MERS-COV, with the presence of fever, cough and dyspnea.
Some patients also have diarrhoea.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can evolve rapidly into acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the high homology of 82% in the nucleotide sequence, they are grouped into different branches in the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-COV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but is more transmissible than SARS-COV and MERS-COV.
Asymptomatic individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, and they can contribute to the rapid spread of the virus in the world.
The comparison and contrast of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs reveal similarities and differences of great relevance.
First, the incubation period and the duration of the evolution of the HCoV disease are very similar.
In this sense, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Secondly, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 is between the severity of SARS-COV and the severity of the four HCOVs acquired in a Community manner (HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection has characteristics that are most observed during infection with acquired HCoVs in a community manner, including the presence of non-specific, mild or even absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subgroup of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be observed, as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is a little smaller.
Thirdly, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns, both in the HCoVs acquired in a Community way and in the SARS-CoVs.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of HCoVs acquired in the community.
On the other hand, it should be confirmed that the transmissibility of SARS-COV-2 decreases after moving to human beings, as in the case of SARS-COV and MERS-COV.
Finally, in the same way as the other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in faecal samples.
It still needs to be clarified in future studies if the oro-fecal transmission of SARS-COV-2 plays an important role, as in the case of SARS-COV, at least in some circumstances.
It is also of great interest to discover whether SARS-CoV-2 can show seasonality, as in cases of HCoVs acquired in a community way.
In any event, the characteristics of SARS-COV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable propagation after its passage to human beings, will influence the outcome of the current outbreak of COVID-19.
All HCoVs acquired by community mode that cause mild symptoms have adapted well to human beings.
From another perspective, it may also be true that human beings have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, the two could be the survivors of old HCoV pandemics.
HCoVs that cause serious diseases in humans and people who develop serious HCoVs diseases have been eliminated.
In order for this to happen, HCoVs need to replicate in human beings to a sufficient extent in order to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that neutralize the restriction factors.
In this sense, the longer the stay of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, the more people will be infected, and the greater the chance that the virus will adapt to human beings.
If the adaptation is adequate, its transmission to human beings would be difficult to control with quarantine or other infection control measures.
For several years, the four CoVs acquired in a Community way circulate in human populations, causing common cold in immunocompetent individuals.
These viruses don't need an animal reservoir.
On the other hand, highly pathogenic SARS-COV and MERS-COV did not adapt well to being human, and their transmission among human beings cannot be sustained.
They need to keep and propagate in their zoonotic reservoirs and take advantage of the chance of migrating to susceptible human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the four HCoVs acquired in a community manner.
It is highly transmissible, in the same way as the HCoVs acquired in a Community way, at least so far.
However, it is more pathogenic than communityly acquired HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-COV and MERS-COV.
It still needs to be discovered if it will fully adapt to human beings and circulate between us without a reservoir or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, it would be useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate and amplifiers of HCoVs.
An animal serves as the evolutionary host of an HCoV if it hosts a direct relation ancestor, sharing high homology at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
The ancestral virus is usually well-adapted and non-pathogenic in this host.
Similarly, a reservoir host hosts HCoV continuously and permanently.
In both cases, hosts are naturally infected and are the natural hosts of HCoV or its parental virus.
On the other hand, if HCoV is newly introduced to an intermediate host just before or near its introduction to human beings, it does not adapt adequately to the new host, and is generally pathogenic.
This intermediate host can serve as the zoonotic source of human infection and perform the function of an amplifier host, allowing the virus to replicate in a transient manner and then transmit it to humans and increasing the scale of human infection.
An HCoV may have the infection interrupted if it cannot sustain its transmission in the intermediate host.
On the other hand, HCoVs can also adapt to the intermediate host and establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes the natural reservoir host.
Epidemiological data revealed that the patient zero of SARS had a history of contact with hunting animals.
Subsequent seroprevalence investigations indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG compared to that of the general population.
Masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) and a dog-guaxinin in live animal markets were initially identified as virus carriers similar to SARS-CoV.
The identification was indirectly corroborated by the fact that no other SARS was notified after the slaughter of all the civets in the markets.
However, it was reported that wild masked palm civets or farms without exposure to live animal markets were highly negative for SARS-CoV, suggesting that masked palm civets could only be the intermediate amplifier host, but not the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
It is noted that 80% of the different animals in the markets in Guangzhou have anti-SARS-COV antibodies; the possibility that several species of small mammals can serve as intermediate amp hosts of SARS-COV cannot be excluded.
All these animals appear to be terminal hosts of SARS-CoV.
The subsequent search by the SARS-CoV natural animal host revealed a narrow-relational bat CoV, named CoV HKU3 of the Rhinolophus bat related to SARS (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in the Chinese bat.
These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and for SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genomic sequence.
This and other bat CoVs share 88% to 92% homology with SARS-CoV in nucleotide sequence.
These studies formed the basis for the new concept that bats are the host of emerging human pathogens.
Several SARS-like COVs (SL-CoVs) have also been identified in bats, but no COV, with the exception of the designated WIV1, can be isolated as live viruses.
It is known that the converting enzyme of angiotensin 2 (ECA2) of human beings is the receptor of SARS-CoV.
It has been shown that WWI1 derived from faecal samples of bats uses ECA2 of bats, civets and human beings as a receptor for entry into cells.
It is intriguing that the serum of patients convalescent from SARS was able to neutralize the WIV1.
So far, the WIV1 represents the ancestor with the closest to SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% homology in the nucleotide sequence.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parental virus of SARS-CoV, and that bats are not the immediate reservoir hosts of SARS-CoV.
The phylogenetic analysis groups MERS-CoV in the same group as the COV-HKU4 of bats and that the CoV-HKU5 of bats.
CoV-HKU4 of bats and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, dipeptidil-peptidase 4 (DPP4), for virus entry.
RNA polymerase sequences that are dependent on MERS-CoV RNA are phylogenetically closer to the betaCoV counterparts of bats identified in Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-COV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-COV and its closest relative, the COV-HKU25 of bats, share only 87% homology in the nucleotide sequence.
Therefore, bats may not be the immediate reservoir host of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromedaries are seropositive for specific neutralization antibodies of MERS-COV, in the same way as camels in the Middle East in several countries in Africa.
The live MERS-COV, identical to the virus found in human beings, was isolated from nasal dromedary scrubs, increased evidence that camels serve as the legitimate MERS-COV reservoir host.
It is also worth noting that symptoms generally mild, but with massive transmission of the virus, were observed in experimentally infected camels with MERS-CoV.
It is remarkable that the infected camels transmit the viruses not only by the respiratory route, but also by the fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of transmission of viruses in bats.
However, there are still no answers, since many confirmed cases of MRS have no history of contact with camels prior to the appearance of symptoms, which can be attributed, in a plausible way, to transmission between people or transmission routes involving unidentified animal species that host MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% of nucleotide homology with a bat RaTG13 CoV, isolated from Rhinolophus affinis bats.
As with SARS-COV and MERS-COV, the divergence in the sequence between SARS-COV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to attribute a parental relationship.
In other words, bats may not be the immediate reservoir hosts of SARS-CoV-2, unless almost identical COVs of bats are discovered in the future.
It is assumed that the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-COV-2 should be set up among wild species sold and slaughtered in the Huan Sea Fruit Attack Market, to which many of the initial cases of the COVID-19 were associated, indicating a probable event of transmission of animals to humans.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing suggested that a group of small endangered mammals known as pangolins (Javanica Manis) could also house ancestral betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2.
These new coV genomes of pangolim share 85% to 92% homology in nucleotide sequence with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are also, in the same way, directly related to the RaTG13, with about 90% identity at nucleotide sequence level.
They are grouped into viruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a receptor binding domain (DLR) with SARS-CoV-2, with 97.4% identity following amino acids.
In a huge contrast, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 DLRs are more divergent, although they have a high degree of sequential homology throughout the genome.
A recent study on patient pangolins also reported the detection of viral consensus sequences of lung samples, which are closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted different methods of configuration and manual healing to generate a partial genomic sequence, corresponding to about 86.3% of the viral genome in total size.
We cannot exclude the possibility that pangolim is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence confirming the direct origin of the SARS-COV-2 of the pangolim due to the divergence in the sequence between SARS-COV-2 and betaCOVs related to SARS-COV-2 of the pangolins.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even lower than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2 from pangolins.
The evolutionary path of SARS-COV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals still needs to be clarified.
While the highest sequential homology was found in the DLRs between SARS-COV-2 and pangolim, betaCoVs related to SARS-COV-2, SARS-COV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest broad genomic sequential homology.
It is highly speculative that the high degree of similarity between the DLRs of the betaCoVs of pangolins related to SARS-COV-2 and SARS-COV-2 is derived from the convergent evolution mediated by selectivity.
A contrary argument is in favour of the recombination between betaCoV of pangolins related to SARS-COV-2 and RaTG13 in the third wild animal species.
As a driving force in evolution, recombination is quite present in betaCoVs.
The immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 remains under investigation.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 viruses has also been studied.
phylogenetic evidence indicated that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E could have originated from Morcego CoVs, while the parental viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 were discovered in rodents.
It was reported that a CoV of bats called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected in the North American tricolor bat had a direct relationship with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another Morcego CoV, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, and there is also suspicion that the Camelides are their intermediate hosts.
For greater clarity, the current knowledge of the known animal origins of HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
The phylogenetic analysis provided evidence for interspecific transmission events of HCoVs throughout history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed the species and infected human beings from domestic animals around 1890, a respiratory infection pandemic was recorded.
The history of interspecific transmission of HCoV-229E is less clear.
AlfaCoVs of bats closely related to HCoV-229E were discovered.
Among them, there's an alphaCoV of alpacas.
Several lines of evidence corroborate the direct transmission of the virus from bats to human beings.
First, human beings, but not alpacas, may have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
On the other hand, human beings have direct contact with the alpacas.
Second, the alphaCoVs of bats related to HCoV-229E are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, while alphaCoV of alpacas caused an epidemic of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpacas alphaCoV was not found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility cannot be excluded that alpacas obtain from human beings alphaCoV related to HCoV-229E.
In fact, bats are the direct source of pathogenic viruses for humans, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not surprising that bats transmit HCoV-229E directly to human beings.
Alternatively, while alphaCoVs serve as a genetic pool of HCoV-229E, alpacas and dromedaries can serve as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, exactly as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-COV serves as an excellent example of the interspecific transmission of bats to dromedars and dromedars for humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats is known in its initial identification and was corroborated by subsequent results.
It is obvious that bats provide a rich pool of viral species to exchange interspecies of genetic fragments and interspecies transmission.
Longevity, high-density colonies, narrow social interaction and high flight capacity are all favorable conditions for bats to be the ideal viral propagator.
On the other hand, the introduction of MERS-COV into the drromedaries dates back to decades.
It is well adapted to these camels, and migrated from an intermediate host to a natural and stable reservoir host.
MERS-CoV causes a very mild disease and supports a relatively low rate of mutation in these animals.
Its sporadic transmission to humans is an accident, and human beings remain terminal hosts of MERS-CoV, since their transmission cannot be sustained.
In contrast to the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-COV, the role of pangolins, if any, in the transmission of SARS-COV-2, is different.
Specifically, pangolin betaCoVs are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They can be a terminal host for betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2, similar to the civets, in the case of SARS-CoV.
Various possibilities for the interspecific transmission of SARS-CoV-2 of animals to humans need to be confirmed or discarded in future studies.
First, bats could be the host of a virus related to SARS-COV-2, almost identical to SARS-COV-2.
Human beings could share the ecological niche with bats through the slaughter or coal mines.
Secondly, pangolins could be one of the amplifier intermediate hosts, in which a SARS-CoV-2-related virus had been newly introduced.
Human beings contract the virus through the slaughter and consumption of hunting meat.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
A research on antibodies produced from domestic and wild animals is required.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in a third species that has contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is still active.
In addition to the different types of animal hosts, three main factors in the virus are important in making it easier for the CoVs to cross the barriers of species.
First, its rate of relatively high mutation in RNA replication.
Compared to other simple-acting RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rates of the CoVs can be considered as ‘moderated’ to ‘high’ with an average replacement rate of approximately 10-4 substitutions per year, per location, depending on the adaptation phase of the CoV to the new hosts.
CoVs have exorribonuclease with review mechanism, whose exclusion results in excessively high mutability and attenuation, or even inviability.
It is interesting that the remdesiver nucleotide analogue suppresses the replication of the CoV by inhibiting this exorribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remedivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents tested in clinical trials.
However, the mutation rates of the CoVs are almost a million times higher than that of their hosts.
In addition, the mutation rate is usually high when the CoVs are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, which has a high rate of mutation, the rate of mutation of SARS-COV-2 is low, apparently, suggesting its highest level of adaptation to humans.
Presumably, he has already adapted to another host who maintains contact with human beings.
In addition to SARS-COV-2, this also applies to MERS-COV, which is well adapted to the dromedaries.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that a genetic change would rapidly ineffective vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2.
Secondly, the large RNA genome in CoVs exerts extra plasticity in the modification of the genome for mutations and recombinations, thus increasing the likelihood of interspecific coevolution, which is advantageous for the emergence of new CoVs when conditions become appropriate.
This is corroborated by the abundance of unique reading tables and protein coded functions in relation to the last three inches of the end of the genome.
Thirdly, the CoVs exchange models in a random and frequent way during RNA replication by means of a unique (copy choice) mechanism.
In a host that serves as a mixing container, the exchange of tapes occurs frequently during the transcription of the coV RNA.
Highly homologous and subgenomic long RNAs can be recombined to generate new CoVs.
phylogenetic evidences of natural recombination were found both in HCoV-HKU1 and HCOV-OC43, as well as in animal coVs, as well as in batCoV-HKU9 and batCOV-HKU9.
Virus-host interaction in relation to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, the viral interaction with the host receptor is another key factor that influences interspecific transmission.
Here, the recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example, which also showed evidence of positive selection during interspecific transmission events.
Based on the comparative analysis of human and civet SARS-COV isolates, SARS-COV is believed to undergo rapid adaptation in different hosts, especially with mutations in the DLR of the S protein.
In general, the DLR in the S protein of a CoV interacts with the cell receptor and is strongly selected by the host's antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, the DLR is in the 318o-510o amino acids in the S1 fragment, which binds to the human ECA2 as well as its rectifiers for viral entry.
The SARS-CoV DLR is able to recognize ECA2 receptors from various animals, including bats, civets, mice and dogs-guaxinins, enabling interspecific transmission of the virus.
In fact, it was observed that only six amino acid residues were different from human viral isolates and civetas in the DLR, and four of them are located in the reason for binding the receptor to interaction with the ECA2 receptor.
Civet SARS-COV has K479N and S487T mutations in its DLR, which could increase the affinity of the protein spike interaction with the human ECA2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions could be critical for viral adaptation in humans.
It is worth noting that SARS-COV-2 shares the same cellular receptor with SARS-COV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the S protein implies that the binding affinity of your S protein with human ECA2 could have been altered.
In fact, a study with electronic cryomicroscopy indicates an affinity of 10 to 20 times greater of this bond than between human ECA2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also be useful to determine whether any other corrections may be necessary for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
It is intriguing that HCoV-NL63 also binds to ECA2, but with a different part of the protein S.
There are several other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E and sialic acid 9-O-acetylated for HCoV-OC43.
They could also respond to the effective adaptation of these CoVs in human beings after the interspecific transmission of their animal hosts.
In addition to cellular receptors, the result of interspecific transmission of HCoVs is also governed by other factors of restriction and dependence with the host.
The divergence of these host proteins between human beings and the natural reservoir hosts of HCoVs such as bats, dromeds and rodents could constitute a barrier to interspecific transmission.
HCoVs need to usurp the dependency factors with the host and subvert the restraint factors of the host for effective interspecies transmission.
In this sense, molecular determinants in this important area of the virus-host interaction still need to be identified and characterized.
An unintended screening with genome reach of the host's dependency and restriction factors for SARS-COV-2 using modern CRISPR technology can yield good results.
Emerging new HCoVs: back to the zero stake
The diversity of bat CoVs provides ample possibilities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this sense, bat CoVs serve as a genetic pool of HCoVs.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also boost the evolution of HCoV and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein coding genes has the potential to drastically modify viral phenotypes.
Among the accessory proteins of SARS-CoV, it is believed that ORF8 is important in its adaptation to human beings, since bat viruses related to SARS-CoV were isolated, but it was found that they encode divergent ORF8 proteins.
A characteristic of the exclusion of nucleotide 29 of SARS-CoVs was discovered in isolated strains at the beginning of the human epidemic.
The exclusion divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and it is believed to be an adaptive mutation that promotes the alternation of hosts.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a possible recombination history with alphaCoVs lineages and CoVs range, where a large number of smaller recombinant regions were identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Recombination sites were also identified in nsp9, most of the nsp10 and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, it was demonstrated that the epidemic MERS-CoV underwent recombination events between different lineages, which occurred in dromedaria in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events were also observed in other HCoVs, in which HCoVs recombined with other COVs of animals in their non-structural genes.
It should also be warned that artificial selection can contribute to unwanted changes in viral genomes, probably resulting from the relief of selection pressure exerted on viruses, such as the pressure of the host's immune system.
One example of these effects is the loss of a long ORF4 in the prototype strain of HCoV-229E due to the exclusion of two nucleotides.
While intact ORF4 can be observed in mice and camels viruses related to HCoV-229E, alphaCoV of alpacas presents a simple insertion of nucleotides, resulting in a change in the frames.
Finally, but no less important, the evolution of new HCoVs is also driven by selection pressure in their reservoir hosts.
Absence of symptoms or only mild symptoms were detected in bats when infected with CoVs, indicating the mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
The bats are likely to be well adapted to the anatomical and physiological coVs.
For example, defects in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats reduce with efficiency the pathology triggered by CoVs.
In addition, the activity of natural exterminating cells in bats is suppressed due to the adaptation of the natural exterminator cell receptor NKG2/CD94, and to the low degree of expression of class I molecules of the main histocompatibility complex.
Furthermore, the high level of reactive oxygen species (ROE) generated from the high metabolic activity of bats can both suppress the replication of the COV and affect the revision by exorribonuclease, thus providing selective pressure for the generation of highly pathogenic virus strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic strains of CoV could also evolve by recombination, leading to the acquisition of new protein or protein features for the host's adaptation.
Therefore, it is not a coincidence that three new HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic, or cause, at most, mild symptoms in their reservoir hosts, such as bats and camels.
They respond immensely without causing a high immune response from the host.
In this document we find explanations about the discovery of asymptomatic carriers and the cause of serious cases in human infection.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to the hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokine cascade, in which the greater the immune response, the more severe the damage to the lungs.
On the other hand, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was turned off from the replication of the CoV.
The same strategy for stopping immune response could have beneficial effects on anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon response is specifically strong in bats.
Therefore, the administration of interferon type I at the initial stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of NLRP3 in the bats is poor.
Following this reasoning, the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammatory with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-COV-2 follows the same principles by which SARS-COV and MERS-COV emerged.
While it was discovered that the betaCoV of bats shares 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, there is a COV of bats that shares 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although it has been discovered that the civets and other animals in the markets have viruses identical to SARS-COV, intermediate hosts for SARS-COV-2 have not been identified.
BetaCoVs of pangolins, with high homology with SARS-CoV-2, were discovered, indicating that pangolins can serve as one of the intermediate hosts, or the betaCoVs of pangolins can contribute with genetic fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although the questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is produced by man accidentally or intentionally.
The CoVs returned to global attention due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
The study of the CoVs in bats and other animals drastically changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs of HCoVs in transmission between humans.
Wide diffusion evidence shows that SARS-COV, MERS-COV and SARS-COV-2 originate in the bat and are transmitted to people through intermediate hosts.
Since SARS-CoV infection originated from the contact between human beings and civets in markets, the closure of wet markets and the slaughter of civets in these markets could have put an end to the SARS epidemic.
Following the same reasoning, the pangolins should be removed from the wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, in the face of the discovery of multiple betaCoV strains of pangolins closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, it should still be clarified in future studies if SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other mammals, and the mode of such transmission.
On the other hand, MERS-COV has existed in dromedarias for a long time.
These camels serve as an important means of transport, and are an essential source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the local community.
They are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to sacrifice all camels for MERS control, as was done in the markets of wild animals in China to prevent the spread of SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2.
In order to stop the recurrent epidemics of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective MERS-CoV vaccines for camels in combination with other infection control measures.
Since we have not been able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may arise and cause epidemics.
A variety of zoonotic CoVs circulate in nature.
Specifically, bat CoVs with zoonotic potential are very diverse.
There are several possibilities that these zoonotic CoVs evolve and recombin, resulting in the emergence of new CoVs that are more transmissible and/or lethal to human beings in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some places in China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the crisis of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better response and preparation plan should be adopted.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a long time.
They stay in their natural reservoirs until there is a chance of migration to another species.
Although bats have many characteristics that favor the spread of the virus, the chance that people are in contact with bats and other wild species can be minimized if people are taught to stay away from them.
Continuous surveillance in mammals is necessary for a better understanding of the ecology of the CoVs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of animals to human beings and future epidemics.
To conclude, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is for people to stay away from the ecological niches of the natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.
Several pieces of the puzzle of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First, if bats transmit an ancestral SARS-COV-2 virus to pangolins, it is important to discover under which circumstances bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in transmission to human beings, it should be determined how people come into contact with bats.
Thirdly, if a third mammal has the role of the true intermediate host, it needs to be clarified the way in which it interacts with the different species, including human beings, bats and pangolins.
Finally, since several mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-COV-2, both surveillance and experimental infection should be performed.
If it is a bat, pangolim or other mammal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its parental viruses that are almost identical are identified in their natural hosts in the future.
Continuing research in this area will elucidate the evolutionary route of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of VOC-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria for ‘suspected case’ and ‘confirmed case’ of COVID-19
On February 6, 2020, our team published a quick guidance guide for the diagnosis and treatment of infection of the new coronavirus of 2019 (2019-nCoV). This guide transmits our experience and constitutes a good reference to combat this worldwide pandemic.
However, the disease of the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) is new. Our understanding and knowledge increase gradually based on the constant findings of research and experiences in clinical practice; as a result, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
In this letter, we answer a comment about our guide and provide the most recent diagnostic criteria of -suspected case - and - confirmed case - according to the latest Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 (seventh version) published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak, which is now officially referred to as the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and the virus is called coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO classified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick online guidance guide for Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
He's been attracting excellent attention since the publication.
However, note that COVID-19 is a new disease. Our understanding and knowledge increase gradually based on the constant findings of research and experiences in clinical practice; because of this, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
For example, the COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020 have a total of seven editions with substantial changes in the context in some.
Our guide now received a comment from Zhou et al., who presented a simple score proposal based on his clinical experience.
This work added new evidence to our guide and also makes valuable references to this worldwide pandemic.
We endorse your meaningful work and express our gratitude.
However, his work also needs to be updated according to the latest Diagnostic and Treatment Guides of COVID-19 (seventh trial version) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm the suspected case, it is necessary to combine an item of epidemiological history with two items of clinical manifestations to perform a comprehensive analysis, or it is necessary to complete three items of clinical manifestations, if there is no clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or residency in the city of Wuhan and in nearby areas or other communities where CVID-19 cases have been reported in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (2) a history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with positive nucleic acid test); (3) a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from the city of Wuhan and from nearby areas or from other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the occurrence of symptoms; (4) a history of contact with a group of confirmed cases (greater or equal to two cases with fever and/or respiratory symptoms occurring within 2 weeks in small spaces, such as home, office, classroom, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with imaging diagnostic resources of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell counts showing normal, decreased or reduced lymphocytes in the initial stage of symptoms.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case should be based on a suspected case with any of the following serological or pathogenic items: (1) positive PCR examination for SARS-CoV-2; (2) complete viral genome sequencing showing high homogeneity in relation to the new known coronaviruses; (3) positive for specific IgM and IgG antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 in serum examination; or some modification of specific IgG antibody for SARS-CoV-2 in negative for positive or increased titration greater or equal to four times in the recovery phase above that in the acute phase.
We can note that the real-time PCR test for nucleic acid in blood or respiratory tract samples was added to the second and third edition (18 and 22 January 2020, respectively).
The pathogenic detection of blood sample was added to the fourth and fifth edition (of 27 January 2020 and 8 February 2020 respectively), and the serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These modifications are based on the continuous work of researchers in the search for an ideal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis and respiratory tract samples, including blood sampling, which increased the availability of different specimens and helped bring the positive result of specific antibodies to the confirmed criteria.
In addition, there is more and more evidence that reminds us of paying attention to symptomatic and asymptomatic patients who are atypical.
Therefore, the flow chart of Zhou et al. should be updated, since it classifies the person without clinical symptoms as \"low risk\"
The scoring system also needs to be verified in more clinical studies and practices.
To conclude, we expect the emergence of more direct evidence and ask readers to provide their comments.
For the diagnosis of \"suspected case\" and \"confirmed case\" we suggest that they check and obey the most recent guidelines of their countries of origin.
Our team will also update our guide in time to offer help.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19, highest daily number
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19 on the day.
That's the biggest number of deaths in a day due to the virus.
On yesterday's date, the Institute for Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research of Bangladesh (IEDCR) reported that the number of confirmed cases recorded included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases that remained at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
On an online newsletter, the director of IEDCR, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said that the deaths included four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were over 60 years old, two were between 51 and 60 years old and one was between 41 and 50 years old.
She also said that two of the victims were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 pandemic on 11 March.
A hospital officer told Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, who was treated at the Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video release, the Bengali minister of road transport and Obaidul Quader bridges said that public transport would be paralyzed longer than initially planned until next Saturday.
This paralysing of public transport began on 26 March and was planned to end on Saturday, 4 April.
The transport of essential products (medical products, fuel and food) was still allowed.
The first incidents of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh were recorded on March 8, in two people who returned from Italy and also in one of them's wives.
On March 19, the three had already recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 surpasses one million infections worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of infections by the SARS-COV-2 coronavirus worldwide passed over one million, indicated Johns Hopkins University data.
At least 52,000 deaths were linked to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
This mark came on the same day that Malaui confirmed his first coronary virus infections and Zambia had his first virus-related death.
North Korea stated that until Thursday, it was one of the few remaining countries free from coronavirus infections.
Until yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the 24 hours prior to 10 a.m. in Central European Timetable (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronaviruses, linked to at least 5,900 deaths, were recorded.
CBS News reported, citing Johns Hopkins University data, that there were more than 1,000 deaths in the US caused by coronary virus infections on Wednesday.
Around the world, countries have announced more rigid measures to inhibit the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the total blockade of the city until May 1.
In the national sphere, President Vladimir Putin stated that the Russians would continue to be paid without attending work until 30 April.
The Portuguese parliament voted to extend the national state of emergency in 15 days. The vote was adopted by 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions and one against.
Saudi Arabia extended for the whole day the duration of the curfew in the sacred cities of Mecca and Medina. Previously, this duration was only from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m.
Thailand plans to implement pick-up touch from 10:00 to 4:00
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state had extended the order to stay home until May 1.
Shops in Australia reduce the limits of toilet paper by transaction
On Saturday and Sunday evenings, the Woolworths and Coles Australian store networks reduced the purchase restrictions on toilet paper, respectively, to two packages and one package per transaction at all stores in the country.
On Monday, ALDI also implemented a limit of one package.
These limitations were communicated by messages in the boxes and on the Facebook pages of the networks.
Because of the fear of COVID-19, buyers were supposedly stocking up in case there was a need to isolate themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the purchase of toilet paper with home delivery to a package per order.
These changes came after the previous restriction of four packages per transaction implemented by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March, respectively.
Coles, in her March 8, press release, reported that, even with the restriction of four packages, - many stores are still running out of stock in less than an hour after delivery - and called the demand for -unprecedented - while ALDI called it \"unexpected - in a Facebook post on Tuesday.
Sales had a marked increase last week, according to a Woolworths spokesperson.
Costco's store in Canberra also limited the amount allowed for two packages last week.
To further alleviate the scarcity, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased the frequency of delivery, Woolworths ordered extra stock, while ALDI previously made available stocks of a planned promotion for Wednesday.
Russel Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Association of Varejistas, said that retailers are trying to increase stocks, but that restrictions on the frequency of deliveries by truck make this difficult.
It expects high production costs, as suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the early release of the stock, some stores will not be able to make the Wednesday promotion.
In a report by News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, retail specialist at Queensland University of Technology, said stores put the stock back every night.
He pointed out that toilet paper is a bulky item with low stock numbers in terms of quantity, and that, when exhausted, it leaves many empty spaces on shelves, increasing the feeling of scarcity.
Coles and Woolworths have the opinion that if there was a lot on the shelves, if products like rolls of toilet paper and antiseptics could be [buyed] and were there in quantities, you would probably reduce the panic, Russel Zimmerman told ABC News.
The recycled toilet paper maker Who Gives to Crap said on the last Wednesday that they would run out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, which produces the Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, which produces the Sorbent, emphasized that they were working 24 hours a day/7 days a week to maintain the supply, according to news.com.au report.
The real estate site domain.com reported that some real estate vendors were offering free toilet paper to the first auction bidders in Melbourne, when fewer auctions were being made with buyers entering the long weekend of Work Day.
The NT News Thursday edition, a Darwin daily print, included an eight-page insert to be cut and used as a toilet paper.
Initially, stores were reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a report by ABC Australia on 3 March in which they said they had no plans to implement restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also on high demand, such as masks, antiseptics, dry products, soaps for hands and flour.
As in Australia, on Sunday night, the British online supermarket Ocado limited the purchases of the toilet paper Andres to two packs of 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization declares COVID's pandemic-19
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that the current outbreak of COVID-19 — the disease caused by the SARS-COV-2 coronavirus — is a pandemic.
Although the word “pandemia” indicates only the degree of spread of a disease, not how dangerous the specific cases are, the WHO emphasized the need to drive governments to act:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries are able to detect, test, treat, isolate, trace and mobilize the population for a response, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO's director-general.
We are very concerned about alarming levels of dissemination and gravity and alarming levels of lack of action.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it is an unprecedented pandemic.
In comments published by CNN in February, he said that -outside the influence, no other respiratory virus was monitored from birth to continuous global dissemination -
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar position, stating that we had never seen a pandemic started by a coronavirus.
And it went on - and we never saw a pandemic that could be controlled at the same time -
The new pandemic status follows WHO’s January decision to declare the outbreak an emergency of public health of international concern.
Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said that the outbreak, in short, is going to get worse.
On Thursday, the Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, with more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 pandemic of the coronavirus is a continuous disease pandemic by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, an international public health emergency of international concern was declared on 30 January 2020 and recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
By 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 had been reported in 210 countries and territories, with approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people recovered.
The mortality rate is estimated to be 4% in China, while overall it varies from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is approximately five days, but may vary from two to fourteen days.
There is no known specific antiviral vaccine or treatment.
Primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. The prevention measures recommended include hand washing, covering the mouth when coughing, keeping people away and monitoring and isolation of people suspected of infection.
The authorities around the world responded with the implementation of travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, risk controls at the workplace and closure of establishments.
The pandemic resulted in a severe global socioeconomic interruption, postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread shortage of supplies exacerbated by the purchases triggered by panic.
Schools and universities closed at national or local level in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of the world's student population.
Disinformation about the virus spread online and there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, people with offspring and appearance of East and Southeast Asia and other people from areas with significant cases of the virus.
Due to the reduction in travel and closures of the heavy industry, there was a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Wuhan health authorities in China (the capital of Hubei province) reported a group of cases of pneumonia due to unknown cause on December 31, 2019 and an investigation was initiated at the beginning of January 2020.
In large part, the cases were linked to the wholesale market for the fruits of the Sea of Huanan and therefore it is believed that the virus is zoonotic.
The outbreak-causing virus is known as SARS-CoV-2, a recently discovered virus that is closely linked to the bat, pangolim and SARS-COV co-co-viruses. The first person with known symptoms became ill on December 1, 2019 and did not have visible connections with the later group of the seafood market.
From the initial group of cases reported in December 2019, it was found that two thirds had a link with the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unverified report from South China Morning Post suggested that a case pointed to November 17, 2019, in a 55-year-old individual from Hubei province, who may have been the first. On February 26, 2020, WHO reported that, as the new cases reported decreased in China, but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had exceeded the number of new cases from China for the first time.
There may be significant underreporting of cases, especially among people with milder symptoms.
Until February 26, relatively few cases had been reported among young people aged 19 years or younger, accounting for 2.4% of cases worldwide. UK’s leading scientific consultant Patrick Vallance estimated that 60% of the British population would need to be infected until effective collective immunity could be achieved.
The cases refer to the number of people who were tested for COVID-19 and whose tests were confirmed positive according to the official protocols.
By March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population and several countries adopted official policies not to test people with only mild symptoms, such as Italy, Holland, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that, in China until January 23, 86% of CVID-19 infections were estimated to have not been detected and that these undocumented infections were the source of infection of 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of people infected in Italy was considerably greater than the reported cases.
The initial estimates of the basic reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it can be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not recover, the time from the onset of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, 14 days being the most common.
By 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were attributed to COVID-19.
In China, by February 5, approximately 80% of deaths occurred in people over 60 years of age and 75% had pre-existing medical conditions, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. The official death count for the COVID-19 pandemic usually refers to people who died and who had a positive test for COVID, according to the official protocols.
The actual number of deaths by COVID-19 may be much higher, since it may not include people who died without having tested, for example, who died at home, in resting houses, etc.
Italy's partial data showed that the additional number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID death count by a factor of 4-5x.
A spokesperson for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged that - we know that [the number of official deaths] is underestimated - a statement corroborated by episodic reports of underreporting in the US. This underestimation often occurs in pandemics, such as the H1N1 swine influenza epidemic in 2009. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside China occurred on February 1, in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on February 14.
On 28 February, outside China, more than a dozen deaths had already been recorded in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
On March 13, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths on all continents except Antarctica. Several measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary according to the region and over time and are influenced by the volume of tests, quality of the health system, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak and the characteristics of the population, such as age, gender and general health. The fatality coefficient represents the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed in a given interval.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the overall fatality coefficient is 6.0% (97.039/1.617.204) until 10 April 2020.
The number varies according to the region.
In China, estimates of the fatality coefficient fell from 17.3% (in people starting symptoms between 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for people starting symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other measures include the mortality rate (CFR), which represents the percentage of diagnosed people dying from a disease, and the mortality rate of the infection (IFR), which represents the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from the disease.
These statistics are not static over time and follow a specific population of infection through resolution of the case.
Some academics have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The University of Oxford Evidence Based Medicine Center estimates that the lethality rate of infection for the pandemic, in general, is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The higher estimate of this range is compatible with the results of the first random test for COVID-19 in Germany and with a statistical study that analyzed the impact of the tests on CFR estimates.
WHO states that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and maximum duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may change according to the site.
Maciej Boni, from Pennsylvania State University, stated that, without proper control, infectious epidemics usually reach their peak and then enter into decline when there are no more hosts available for the disease.
But it is almost impossible to do any proper projection at the time about when this will happen.
The senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, Zhong Nanshan, argued that, until June, all countries could mobilize to follow WHO recommendations regarding measures to prevent the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 will probably remain in circulation for a year or two —
According to Imperial College's study, led by Neil Ferguson, physical distance and other measures will be necessary, as long as a vaccine is available (potentially within 18 months or more)
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University stated: \"I find it unlikely that this coronavirus will disappear completely, since it is highly transmissible - and - it may become a seasonal disease, reappearing every year -
The virulence of the reappearance will depend on the group immunity and the extent of the mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively nonspecific and infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory secretion production (catarrh), loss of olfactory sensation, lack of air, muscle and joint pain, throat pain, headache, chills, vomiting, hemoptosis, diarrhoea or cyanosis. WHO states that approximately one in six people is seriously ill and has difficulty breathing.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists that emergency symptoms are the difficulty of breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty walking and face or lips with blue color. It is advised to seek medical help if these symptoms are present. The evolution of the disease can cause severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, with no clinical symptoms, but with the results of the tests that confirm the infection, therefore, researchers recommend that those who have been in close contact with a person with confirmed infection be monitored and examined closely to rule out the infection.
Chinese estimates of asymptomatic ratio range from some up to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between the onset of infection and symptoms) varies from one to 14 days, but it is usually five days. As an example of uncertainty, the estimated fraction of people with COVID-19 who lost the olfactory sensation was initially 30% and later fell to 15%.
Some details about how the disease spreads are still being determined.
This disease is believed to be spread mainly by close contact and small droplets produced during the act of coughing, sneezing or talking, being the close contact considered from 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that coughing without covering the mouth can cause droplets to reach 4.5 feet (15 feet) to 8.2 feet (27 feet).
Some people have proposed that the virus can also be transmitted by droplets that remain for longer periods in the air, which may have been generated during a conversation. Breath droplets can also be produced during the expiration, including speaking, although the virus is not normally suspended.
The droplets may lie in the mouths and noses of people nearby or, possibly, inhaled by the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause the nebulization of respiratory secretions, resulting in air propagation.
Propagation can also occur when someone touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches their own eyes, nose, or mouth.
Although there is concern that it may spread through the feces, it is believed that the risk of this is low.
The Chinese government denied the possibility of oro-fecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although transmission may be possible before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease.
There were positive tests for the disease up to three days before symptoms emerged, suggesting that transmission is possible even before the development of significant symptoms.
There are only a few reports of asymptomatic cases confirmed by the laboratory, but asymptomatic transmission was identified in some countries during contact tracking investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that although it is not entirely clear how easy the disease is to spread, a person usually infects between two and three other people, the virus survives from hours to days on surfaces.
Specifically, it was found that the virus is detectable for up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel 304, for one day in cardboard and for up to four hours in copper.
This, however, varies according to humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals have already tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can pass the virus to humans. However, the British authorities advise to wash their hands after contact with animals, as well as after contact with surfaces that infected people may have touched.
Coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to a set of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus resemble those of coronaviruses related to their nature. Outside the human body, the virus dies by homemade soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-COV-2 is closely associated with the original SARS-COV.
It's believed to be zoonotic.
Genetic analysis revealed that coronavirus is genetically associated with the genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus (line B). Two strains of this same lineage are derived from bats.
It has 96% similarity throughout the genome to other coronavirus samples from bats (BatCoV RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one amino acid of difference in certain parts of the genome sequences between the pangolins virus and that of humans.
The comparison of the entire genome, so far, has found, at most 92% of genetic material sharing between the pangolim coronavirus and SARS-COV-2, which is insufficient to prove that pangolins are the intermediate host.
Virus infection can be provisionally diagnosed on the basis of symptoms. The definitive confirmation, however, is by reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or by computed tomography (TC).
A study done in Wuhan, comparing rRT-PCR to CT suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive, although less specific, with many of its image characteristics matching other pneumonias and pathological processes.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that - the CT is not used for screening or as a front line test for the diagnosis of COVID-19 -
WHO published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on January 17.
The test uses reverse transcription followed by reaction and polymerase chain (rRT-PCR) in real time.
The test can be done in respiratory or blood samples.
The results are usually available from a few hours a day.
Generally, this test is carried out in nasopharyngeal scrub, although throat scrub is also used. Several laboratories and companies are developing serological tests, capable of detecting antibodies.
On 6 April 2020, none of these had been sufficiently accurate to be approved for general use.
A serological test developed by Cellex in the United States was approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.
The particularities of computed X-ray and CT images of symptomatic people include asymmetrical dark glass opacitys and the absence of pleural effusions.
The Italian Radiological Society is gathering an international online database of image results in confirmed cases.
Due to the overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, images without PCR confirmation are of limited specificity in the identification of COVID-19.
A large study in China compared the results of chest CT to those of PCR and showed that, although the image is less specific to infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its consideration as a research tool in epidemic areas.
Convolutional neural networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed for the detection of imaging features of the virus with X-rays and CT.
Strategies to avoid transmission of the disease include maintaining good personal hygiene in general, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth without washing your hands, coughing or sneezing on a paper sheet and putting this sheet directly into a waste container.
It is advised who has already been infected to wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distance measures are also recommended to avoid transmission. Many governments have restricted or advised non-essential travel to or from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
The virus, however, has reached the stage of community spread in vast regions of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities and that some community members do not know where or how they have been infected. It is recommended to health professionals who care for individuals who may be infected to use standard precautions, contact precautions and eye protection. The tracking of contacts is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent further transmission.
The use by the governments of localization data from mobile phones for this purpose has raised privacy issues, with the International Anistia and more than 100 other organizations issuing a statement asking for limits to this type of surveillance.
Several mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use. On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record a user's proximity to other mobile phones.
The users then receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19. Some incorrect concepts about how to prevent infection have circulated, such as, for example, rinse the nose and gargarage with collutory, which has already proved ineffective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19. However, several organizations are working for the development of one.
Washing hands is recommended to avoid spreading the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with water and soap for at least twenty seconds, especially after using the toilet or when the hands are visibly dirty. You should also wash your hands before eating and after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing.
This is because, outside the human body, the virus is killed by homemade soap, which breaks its protective layer.
The CDC also recommends the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer with a minimum volume of 60% alcohol, when there is no soap and water readily available.
WHO advises to avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth without washing your hands.
The surfaces can be decontaminated with several solutions (up to one minute exposure to disinfectant for a stainless steel surface), including ethanol at 62-71%, isopropyl alcohol at 50-00%, sodium hypochlorite at 0.1%, hydrogen peroxide at 0.5% and iodopovidone at 0.2-7.5%.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that, in case of suspicion or confirmation COVID-19 in a location, such as an office or daycare centre, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, shared electronic equipment such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls and electronic boxes used by sick people should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend covering the mouth and nose with the elbow folded or with a sheet of paper when coughing or sneezing, as well as immediately discarding any scarf.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who may be infected, since using a mask may limit the volume and distance of displacement of expiratory droplets when talking, sneezing or coughing.
WHO has published instructions on when and how to wear masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, -The use of masks can reduce people's propensity to touch their faces, which is one of the biggest sources of infection without proper hand hygiene - The use of masks by caregivers of people who may have the disease has also been recommended.
WHO recommended the use of masks by healthy people only when they are at high risk, such as the caregivers of people with COVID-19, although they also recognize that using masks can help people not to touch their own face.
In several countries, the use of masks for the face by the general public has begun to be encouraged.
In the USA, the CDC recommends the use of a non-medical mask for the face made of cloth. China specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks by healthy people in general, especially when coming into close contact with another person (make 1 meter or less away).
In Hong Kong, the use of surgical mask is recommended when using public transportation or when staying in crowded locations.
Thailand's health authorities are encouraging people to make facial masks of cloth at home and to wash them daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, it is forbidden to go out in public without wearing a mask or covering the nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam requested everyone to wear face masks when going out in public areas in order to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has demanded that everyone entering supermarkets should wear a mask for his face.
In Israel, all residents were asked to wear masks for their faces in public.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks per day since mid-March, demanded that passengers on trains and intermunicipal buses wear masks for their faces from 1 April.
In Panama, the use of masks for the face is mandatory on the way out on the street. At the same time, the production of masks at home was recommended for those who could not buy.
Face masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (also known as physical distance) involves infection control actions aimed at slowing the transmission of the disease, by reducing close contact between individuals.
The methods include quarantines, travel restrictions and the closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters or shopping centers.
Social distancing methods can be applied by everyone while staying at home, limiting your travel, avoiding crowded areas, using uncontacted greetings and keeping away from others.
At the moment, many governments are forcing or recommending social distancing in areas affected by the epidemic.
The maximum number of people recommended by the U.S. government agencies and health organizations was rapidly reduced by 250 people (if there is no knowledge of transmission of COVID-19 in a region) to 50 people and later to 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned public meetings of more than two people. Older adults and those with underlying diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension and compromised immune systems face the greatest risk of serious diseases and complications, being advised by the CDC to stay home as much as possible in areas of the Community epidemic. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health agencies began to replace the use of the term \"social disengagement\" by \"physical disengagement\" to clarify that the goal is to reduce physical contact by maintaining social connections, either virtually or remotely.
The use of the term “social distancing” led to implications that social isolation was necessary completely instead of encouraging contact by other alternative means. Some authorities published sexual health guidelines during the pandemic.
These recommendations include having sex only with someone you live with, who does not have the virus or symptoms of the virus.
Home self-insulation was recommended for those who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who suspected that they were infected.
The health agencies have issued detailed instructions for appropriate self-insulation. Many governments have demanded or recommended self- quarantine for entire populations living in affected areas.
The most incisive instructions of auto quarantine were issued to those in high-risk groups.
It was advised to individuals who may have been exposed to others with COVID-19 and those who have recently travelled to a country or region with large-scale transmission that make 14 days of self-quarantine from the moment of the last possible exposure.
Strategies for the control of an outbreak are containment or suppression and reduction.
The containment is carried out in the preliminary stages of an outbreak and aims to trace and isolate the infected, as well as to present other measures to control the infection and vaccines that prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When the spread of the disease is no longer possible, efforts are being made to reduce it: the measures taken now serve to reduce the speed of propagation and to reduce its adverse effects on the health system, as well as on the population.
Container and mitigation measures may be taken at the same time in combination.
The suppression requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic at a rate of reproduction below 1. The management of an outbreak of infectious disease, in part, has to do with trying to reduce the peak of the epidemic. To that end, we call it ‘purchasing the epidemic curve’.
Thus, the risk of overloading health services is reduced, giving more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.
Interventions that are not pharmaceutical and that can manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, the use of masks for face and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing, such as the closure of schools and the cancellation of events leading to agglomeration; community involvement, in order to stimulate acceptance and participation in these interventions; and environmental measures such as cleaning contact surfaces. More drastic actions, in order to contain the outbreak, were taken in China when the severity of the outbreak became clear. Whole cities, for example, were quarantined and travel bans were imposed.
Other countries have taken various measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea, for example, presented the mass screening and the quarantines located. In addition, the government issued alerts about the movement of infected people.
In Singapore, the infected received financial support when they carried out the auto quarantine and, for those who did not do so, severe fines were imposed.
In Taiwan, there was an increase in the production of masks for the face and those who store medical supplies were punished. Simulations carried out in the United Kingdom and the United States show that the reduction (decrease in the rate of contagion, without stopping the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (i.e., the reversal of the epidemic growth) present great challenges.
Ideal policies of reduction can reduce the peak of demand for health services in 2/3 and deaths in half. However, this would result in hundreds of thousands of deaths, while overloading health systems.
Suppression may be the best alternative, but it needs to be maintained while there is the circulation of the virus by the human population or until there is the availability of a vaccine, if that happens before. Otherwise, the transmission occurs again as soon as the measures occur.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic brings social and economic costs.
There is no approved antiviral medicinal product that is specific to COVID-19. However, there are efforts towards the development of medicines, which include the testing of existing medicines.
The use of cold medicines that do not need medical prescription, a lot of liquid drinking, and rest can help to relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the case, the use of oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid insertion or respiratory aid may be necessary.
The use of steroids may worsen the condition.
Several compounds previously approved to treat other viral diseases are under investigation to be used in the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization also stated that some medicines - married and traditional - can alleviate the symptoms caused by the SARS-CoV-19 virus.
WHO describes the increased capacity and adaptation of health care to the needs brought by COVID-19 as fundamental measures to combat outbreak.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, and the WHO office in Europe have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services to displace, at various levels, their resources, including the concentration of laboratory services for the testing of COVID-19, the cancellation of non-compulsory procedures and the separation and isolation of patients with positive testing for COVID-19, as well as the increase of intensive care capabilities through staff training and the increase in the number of beds and fans available.
The theories about the emergence of the first case (the so-called patient zero) are diverse.
The first known case in the new coronavirus dates from 1 December 2019, in the city of Wuhan, in the province of Hubei, China.
In one month, the number of cases of coronary virus in the region gradually increased.
These cases were largely linked to the wholesale market for fruit from the sea of Huan. The market also sold live animals, which led to the theory that the virus came from one of these animals. In other words, it was believed that it had a zoonotic origin. On December 26, a group of patients were observed and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at Hubei Provincial Hospital. The next day, the doctor informed Wuhan Jianghan Center for Disease Prevention and Control.
On December 30, a group of doctors from Wuhan Central Hospital alerted their colleagues about a SARS-like cornavirus.
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were reprimanded by the police for spreading false news. Another doctor, Ai Fen, was rebuked by his superiors for giving the alarm.
The Municipal Health Commission of Wuhan, on December 31, made a statement to the population and informed WHO.
Sufficient cases of unknown birth pneumonia had already been reported to the health authorities of Wuhan to generate an investigation in early January. During the first stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled every seven and a half days, approximately.
At the beginning and mid-January 2020, the virus spread across other provinces of China, facilitated by the migration of the new Chinese year and the fact that Wuhan is a transportation center, as well as a main point of railway connection.
On January 20, China reported about 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzen.
Later official data show that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms by 20 January 2020. On 26 March, the United States overcame China and Italy, with the largest number of cases confirmed in the world. On 9 April 2020, more than 1,61 million cases were reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people died, and more than 364,000 recovered.
Approximately 200 countries and territories have already had at least one case.
On the basis of the pandemic in Europe, many countries that are part of the Schengen Treaty have restricted free movement and established border controls.
The country's reactions included containment measures, such as quarantines (also known as home confinement orders, home holding orders or lockdowns) and curfews. On 2 April, about 300 million people (almost 90% of the population) are somehow confined in the United States, more than 50 million people are confined in the Philippines, around 59 million people are confined in South Africa and 1.3 billion people are confined in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were already in some form of lockdown, which increased to 2.6 billion people two days later, about a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was recorded in Wuhan on 1 December 2019. An unconfirmed report suggests a previous case of 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a group of patients with unknown cause pneumonia on December 26. Her hospital reported the Center for Disease Prevention and Control of Wuhan Jianghan on December 27.
Initial genetic tests, on December 27, 2019, in samples taken from patients indicated the presence of a SARS-type coronary virus.
A population statement was issued by the Municipal Health Commission of Wuhan on 31 December.
WHO was informed on the same day.
When these notifications occurred, Wuhan's doctors were warned by the police about the outbreak.
China's National Health Commission initially claimed that there was no clear evidence of transmission among human beings.
At the end of January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign, later described by the secretary general of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, as a \"people's war\" to contain the spread of the virus.
In what was described as - the largest quarantine in human history - a sanitary cord was announced on January 23 to interrupt trips back or back to Wuhan, which was extended by 15 cities of Hubei, reaching about 57 million people in total.
The use of private vehicles was prohibited in the city.
The New Chinese Year's celebrations on January 25 were cancelled in several locations.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, the Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital, Leishenshan, was built later to serve more patients.
Together with the newly built hospitals, China has converted 14 other Wuhan establishments into temporary hospitals, such as convention and stadium centers. On 26 January, the government launched further measures to contain the outbreak of COVID-19, including the issuance of health statements for travellers and the expansion of the Spring Festival holiday.
Universities and schools throughout the country have also been closed.
The Hong Kong and Macau regions have taken a number of measures, especially with regard to schools and universities.
Remote work measures have been taken in many regions of the country.
Restrictions on travel were performed in and outside Hubei.
Public transport was modified, and museums throughout China were temporarily closed.
The control of the movement of the public was applied in several cities, and it was estimated that about 760 million people (over half of the population) went through some sort of exit restriction. After the outbreak entered its global phase in March, the Chinese authorities took strict measures to avoid the -importation - of the virus from other countries.
Beijing, for example, imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine for all international travellers arriving in the city. On 23 March, mainland China had only one case of domestic transmission within five days, in this case, by a traveler who returned to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, the Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that the spread of domestic transmission cases had been basically blocked and that the outbreak had been controlled in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions were reduced in Hubei, except in Wuhan, two months after the lockdown was imposed. China's Foreign Minister announced on 26 March 2020 that the entry of individuals with visa or residence permit would be suspended from March 28, with no specific details on when this policy will be closed.
Anyone wishing to enter China will need to apply for visas at Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government encouraged companies and factories to reopen on March 30, giving financial stimulus packages to companies. The Council of State declared a day of mourning, starting with a moment of three minutes of silence throughout the country, on April 4 at 10 hours, coincided with the Qingming Festival. The central government, however, asked the families to pay their honors online, observing the physical distance to avoid a new outbreak of COVID-19.
On 20 January 2020, the spread of COVID-19 from China to South Korea was confirmed.
The national health agency of the country reported a significant increase in the cases confirmed on February 20, largely attributed to a meeting in Daegu of a new religious movement, known as the Church of Jesus of Shincheonji.
It is suspected that Shincheonji devotees who visited Daegu coming from Wuhan were the origin of the outbreak.
On February 22, among the 9,336 church followers, 1,261, or about 13% of them reported having symptoms. South Korea declared maximum alert level on February 23, 2020.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported, reaching 3,150 on 29 February.
All military bases in South Korea were quarantined after tests confirmed that three soldiers were positive for the virus.
The airline schedule was also affected and modified. South Korea presented what was considered the world's largest and best organized program in terms of screening the population for the virus. The country also isolated the infected people and tracked and quarantined those who contacted them.
The screening methods included the mandatory individual report of symptoms for those arriving from international travel through a mobile application, test of the virus by drive-thru, with results available the following day, in addition to the increase in the ability to test, which allowed up to 20,000 people per day to be tested.
The programme of South Korea is considered a success in the control of the outbreak, although it has not put entire cities in quarantine. South Korean society was initially divided as to the response to the crisis given by President Moon Jae-in.
Many Koreans signed petitions requesting Moon's impeachment under the claim of government mismanagement of the outbreak, or altering its response.
On March 23, it was reported that South Korea had the total number of cases lower in four weeks.
On 29 March it was reported that from 1 April all new arrivals from abroad should enter quarantine for two weeks.
Through media reports on 1 April, South Korea received requests for help with testing the virus from 121 different countries.
Iran confirmed its first cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection on 19 February in Qom, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died that day.
Early government announced measures included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural events, sporting events, and religious events on Fridays, the closure of universities, higher education institutions, and schools.
Iran has five trillion Riais available to combat the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani said on 26 February 2020 that he had no plans for the quarantine areas affected by the outbreak, and only individuals would be quarantined.
Plans to limit travel between cities were announced in March, although a heavy traffic between cities before the New Persian Year Nowruz continued.
Shia shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020. Iran became the center of the spread of the virus after China during February.
In the midst of allegations of coverage of the extent of the outbreak in Iran, more than ten countries traced their Iran-related cases on 28 February indicating that the extent of the outbreak could be more serious than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government until that date.
The Iranian Parliament was closed, with 23 of its 290 members tested positively for the virus on 3 March.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch vehemently requested the Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders imprisoned for peaceful dissent, and also to temporarily release all eligible prisoners.
The body stated that there is a greater risk of the spread of the virus in closed institutions as detention centres, which also suffer from the lack of medical care.
On March 15, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths on a single day, the largest since the outbreak in the country.
At least 12 politicians in exercise or retired and government officials died from the disease until March 17.
By March 23, Iran had 50 new cases per hour and a new death every ten minutes due to the Coronavirus.
According to one WHO representative, there must be five times more cases in Iran than is being reported.
It is suggested that the US sanctions imposed on Iran may be affecting the country's financial capacity to respond to the viral pandemic.
The High Commissioner for Human Rights requested that economic sanctions be relieved to the nations most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
The outbreak was confirmed as having spread to Italy on January 31, when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
The cases began to increase sharply, which led the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare state of emergency.
A group not associated with the cases of COVID-19 was subsequently detected, starting with 16 cases confirmed in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced a decree-law to contain the outbreak, including the quarantine of more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, \"In the outbreak areas, people's entrances and exits are prohibited.
The suspension of work activities and sporting events had already been determined in these areas.-On March 4, the Italian government requested the total closure of all schools and universities by the country when Italy reached 100 deaths.
All major sporting events, including the football matches of Series A, have to be held at closed doors until April, but on March 9, all sporting events were suspended completely for at least one month.
On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte requested the closure of almost all commercial activities, except supermarkets and pharmacies. On 6 March, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Relief and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published recommendations of medical ethics regarding screening protocols that could be used.

As of 5 April, there were 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 recovered in Italy, with most of these cases occurring in the region of Lombardy.
A CNN report indicated that the combination of an elderly population in Italy and the inability to test all who had the virus until that time may have contributed to a high mortality rate.
The UK's response to the virus first arose as one of the softest in the affected countries, and by 18 March 2020, the British government had not imposed any form of social distancing or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government received criticism for the acknowledged lack of diligence and intensity of its response to the problems faced by the population. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a statement advising the interruption of all non-essential travel and social contact, suggesting that people work at home as much as possible and avoid places such as bars, restaurants and theaters.
On March 20, the government announced that all leisure establishments, such as pubs and gyms, should be closed as quickly as possible, and committed to paying 80% of workers' wages up to a limit of £2,500 per month to avoid unemployment during the crisis. On March 23, the Prime Minister announced heavier social distance measures, preventing agglomerations with more than two people and restricting travel and outdoor activities to the minimum necessary.
Unlike the previous measures, these restrictions were reinforced by the police through the issue of fines and dispersion of agglomerations.
Most of the businesses received orders to close, with exceptions for business considered - essential - including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, petrol stations and car shop.

WHO commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities to manage and contain the epidemic.
WHO observed the contrast between the outbreak of SARS 2002-2004, where the Chinese authorities were accused of omitting data that hindered prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis, where the central government provided regular updates to avoid the near panic of the festivities in the new lunar year -
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the main authorities to implement a transport ban in Wuhan, the representative of WHO Gauden Galea noted that - that certainly was not a WHO recommendation - and was also - a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic in the area where it was most concentrated - on 30 January, after the confirmation of human transmission outside China and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO declared the outbreak as the Emergency of Public Health of International Scope (PHEIC), the sixth PHEIC since the measure was first invoked during the 2009 Swine influenza pandemic.
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom said that PHEIC was invoked due to the risk of global dissemination, especially in low- and medium-income countries without robust health systems.
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that - there is no reason for measures that needlessly interfere on international travel and trade - and that the -WHO does not recommend limiting trade and displacements -
On 5 February, WHO called on the global community for a contribution of $675 million to finance a strategic preparation in low- and medium-income countries, citing the urgent need to assist these countries that - they do not have systems in place to detect the people who contracted the virus, and even if it arises -
Tedros made subsequent statements indicating that - we are as strong as our weakest link - and asked the international community - to report now or they will have to pay later - On 11 February, WHO at a press conference established COVID-19 as the name of the disease.
On the same day, Tedros stated that the Secretary-General of the United Nations, António Guterres, had agreed to provide the “power of the entire United Nations system as a response”
The United Nations Crisis Management Team was activated as a result, allowing coordination of the entire UN response, which the WHO states will allow them to focus on the health response while other agencies can enter their experience in the social, economic and development implications resulting from the outbreak.
On 14 February, a WHO Joint Mission Team with China was empowered to provide domestic management assistance to international experts and WHO on land in China and to assess - the severity and transmissibility of the disease - through workshops and meetings with the main national institutions and to conduct field visits to assess - the impact of response activities on the provincial and municipal levels, including urban and rural panoramas - On 25 February, WHO stated that -the world should do more to prepare for a possible Coronavirus pandemic - stating that, although it was very early to declare a pandemic, countries should nevertheless set up -a phase of preparation -
In response to a developing outbreak in Iran, WHO sent a Joint Mission Team to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials said that the global assessment of the Coronavirus threat would be high from -high - to -very high - is the highest level of alert and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, executive director of the health emergency program, warned in a statement that: This is a statement of reality for every government on the planet: wake up.
This virus may be on its way and you need to be ready - insisting that the correct response measures could help the world avoid - the worst -
Ryan still stated that the current data did not authorize public health officials to declare a global pandemic, saying that such a declaration would mean that we are essentially accepting that each human on the planet will be exposed to this virus.
On 11 March, WHO declared the outbreak of Coronavirus a pandemic.
The Director General said that WHO was - deeply concerned about alarming levels of dissemination and severity, and alarming levels of inaction - WHO faced many criticisms for what was seen as inadequate management of the pandemic, including the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
The reaction included a petition to the Director General of WHO, Tedros Adhanom to submit his resignation, signed by 733 thousand people on 6 April.

The Chinese government was criticized by the United States, by the UK Cabinet Minister Michael Gove, and by the son of Brazil president Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro, for the management of the pandemic, which began in the Chinese province of Hubei.
Administrators at the province level of the Communist Party of China (CPC) were dismissed due to their approach to quarantine-related efforts in Central China, a sign of discontent the response of political establishment to outbreak in these regions.
Some commentators believe that this action was intended to protect the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping of public anger in relation to the outbreak of Coronavirus.
Some Chinese officials, e.g. Zhao Lijian, rejected an early recognition of the Coronavirus outbreak that started in Wuhan, favoring conspiracy theories about COVID-19 originating in the US or Italy.
The administration of the United States of Donald Trump referred to the Coronavirus as the ‘Chinese Virus’ or ‘Wuhan Virus’ saying that China’s censorship overpowered a virus that has now become a global pandemic, which was, in turn, condemned by some critics as racism and a way of diverting the failure in administration to contain the disease.
The Daily Beast managed from a U.S. government cable a detailed communication strategy with apparent origins in the National Security Council, with a strategy being cited as \"This all has to do with China.
It was advised that we try and get these messages in any way, including press conferences and television appearances.-Channels such as Politician, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg indicated that China's efforts to send help to countries affected by the virus is part of a propaganda for a global influence.
The European Union's foreign policy leader Josep Borrell warned that there is a geopolitical component including a struggle for influence through a biased and 'generity policies'.
Borrell also said that China is aggressively spreading the message that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner.
China also requested the United States to suspend its sanctions to Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while it was supposedly sending aid to those countries.
Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba was blocked by United States sanctions on 3 April.
The United States authorities were also accused of diverting aid from other nations to their own country.
And listens to disputes related to masks reported among other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland; and the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has confiscated hundreds of fans destined for Spain.
At the beginning of March, the Italian government criticized the lack of European Union solidarity with those affected by the Coronavirus in Italy.
Maurizio Massari, Italian Ambassador to the European Union, said that China has only responded bilaterally.
Certainly, this is not a good sign of European solidarity -
On March 22, after a phone call with Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin prepared the Russian military army to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles, and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quoted a \"high-level political source\" anonymously that 80 percent of Russia's supplies were \"useless or of little use for Italy\"
The source accused Russia of embarking on an offensive —geopolitics and diplomatic —
The president of the Lombardy region, Attilio Fontana, and the Italian Foreign Minister, Luigi Di Mayo, dismissed the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical supplies to the United States.
Kremlin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov said that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials are in a good phase, they would also act in a reciprocal manner if necessary.
The NATO-Defender 2020 planned military exercise in Germany, Poland and the Baltic states, NATO's largest military exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be kept on a reduced scale.
The Secretary-General for the Nuclear Disarmament Campaign, Kate Hudson, criticized the Defense 2020 exercise: \"In the current public health crisis, this puts at risk the lives not only of the troops of the United States and the various European countries that are participating, but of the inhabitants of the countries in which they operate - the Iranian government has been heavily affected by the virus, with about a dozen members of the infected parliament, as well as fifteen political figures in exercise or former politicians.
Iran President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders, asking for help on March 14, 2020, saying that his country is struggling to combat the outbreak due to the lack of access to international markets as a result of the United States sanctions against Iran. The outbreak led the United States to adopt common social policies in other developed countries, including universal health care, universal child care, paid family leave, and high levels of funding for public health.
Political analysts have anticipated that this could negatively affect Donald Trump's chances of re-election as president in the 2020 elections. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have worsened due to the pandemic.
South Korea criticized Japan's ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts, after Japan announces that any person coming from South Korea would be placed in a two-week quarantine in government designated locations.
South Korean society was initially polarized on President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions asking for Moon's impeachment regarding those they called inadequate management of the outbreak, or praising their response. The pandemic allowed countries to approve emergency laws in response.
Some commentators have expressed concerns that this could enable governments to strengthen their control over power.
In Hungary, the parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by decree indefinitely, to suspend parliament as well as elections and punish those considered to have spread false news about the virus and the management of the crisis by the government.
Coronavirus outbreak has been blamed for several cases of shortage of supplies resulting from increased global use of equipment to combat outbreaks, panic-driven purchases, and disruption of operations in factories and logistics.
The Food and Administration of the United States issued notices on the shortage of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumption and disruptions of the supplier.
Several locations also experienced the panic-motivated shopping event which led to empty shelves of essential products such as food, toilet paper, bottled water, including shortage of supplies.
The particular technology industry has warned about delays in sending electronic products.
According to WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has risen 100 times.
This demand led to an increase in prices of up to twenty times the normal price and also led to delays in the supply of medical items for four to six months.
This also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment around the world, with the WHO warning that this would put workers' health at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for Chinese buyers, who sold Australian products in China.
The activity created a shortage of formulas for babies in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of cases of COVID-19 in northern Italy and in the Wuhan region, and the consequent high demand for food products, both areas were spared from an acute shortage of food.
Measures taken by China and Italy against the illegal storage and trade of essential products were successful, avoiding the shortage of acute food that was planned in Europe and North America.
North Italy with its significant agricultural production has not observed a large reduction, but prices can increase according to industry representatives.
Empty food shelves were found only temporarily, even in the city of Wuhan, and Chinese government officials released pork reserves to ensure sufficient food for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy, requiring food producers to maintain reservations for such emergencies.
A damage to the global economy was felt in China: according to a media report on 16 March, the economy in China was hit a lot in the first two months of 2020 due to the measures taken by the government to shorten the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell 20.5%.
As Continental China is a great economy and manufacturing center, viral outbreak has been seen as a great destabilizing threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of The Economist's intelligence unit predicted that markets will remain volatile until a clearer image emerges on possible results.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the epidemic on global growth could exceed the outbreak of SARS 2002-2004.
An estimate of an expert at the University of Washington in St. Louis indicated an impact of $300 billion on the world supply chain that could last up to two years.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is supposed to be \"confounded\" after a sharp decline in oil prices due to a low demand from China.
Global stock markets fell on February 24 due to a significant increase in the number of cases of COVID-19 outside Continental China.
On 27 February, due to growing concerns about the outbreak of the Coronavirus, several indexes of the United States stock exchange including NASDAQ-100, S&P 500, and the average of the Dow Jones industry have shown their most expressive falls since 2008, with the Dow drop in 1,191 points, the biggest drop in one day since the financial crisis of 2007-08.
All three other indexes ended the week with a lower than 10%.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH declared China's sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative outlook.
The actions fell again on the basis of concerns with the coronavirus, the biggest fall on March 16.
Many consider it a probable economic recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures of central states and banks.
The central banks are reacting more quickly than they have reacted to the 2008 financial collapse.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to travel restrictions, closure of public places including sightseeing points, and the government's recommendation against any travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines cancelled their flights due to low demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Qantas, while the British Regional Flybe Airline collapsed.
The impact on the cruise sector was of a level never seen.
Several train stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chunyun, a large travel station associated with the New Chinese Year holiday.
Several events involving large crowds were cancelled by national and regional governments, including New Year's annual festivals, with private companies also independently closing their shops and tourist attractions such as Disneyland in Hong Kong and Shanghai.
Many New Lunar Year events and tourist attractions were closed to avoid mass agglomerations, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional temple events.
On 24 of the 31 provinces of China, municipalities and regions, authorities extended the New Year's holiday to 10 February, instructing most workplaces not to reopen until this date.
These regions accounted for 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong has increased its level of response to infectious disease to the highest level and has declared emergency, closing schools until March and canceling its New Year celebrations. The retail sector has been affected globally, with reductions in shops schedules or temporary closures.
Visits to resellers in Europe and Latin America fell 40%.
The retailers of North America and the Middle East observed a fall of 50-60%.
This also resulted in a fall of 33-43% in pedestrian traffic to commercial centers in March compared to February.
The operators of Shopping Centers around the world imposed additional measures, such as greater cleaning, installation of thermal scanners to check the temperature of buyers, and cancellation of events. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, it is estimated that the recession induced by the pandemic could leave between 14 and 22 million more people in extreme poverty in Latin America than would happen in situations without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the peak epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China’s 300 million migrant rural workers were left at home in provinces of the interior or prisoners in Hubei province. By March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and asked for help from the government.
The outbreak of the Coronavirus could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate can reach 32%, according to estimates from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The confinement in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (who are paid by means of daily pay) unemployed. A survey by the Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of Canadian families have gone through some kind of unemployment. Nearly 900,000 workers have lost their jobs in Spain since the country adopted the confinement in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for unemployment aid and 1 million British workers requested a universal credit programme. Nearly half a million companies in Germany placed their workers under reduced-time work programmes subsidized by the government known as Kurzabeit.
The reduced-time work programme was adopted by France and Great Britain.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors were deeply affected by the pandemic, affecting the operations of organizations, as well as people - both employed and independent - worldwide.
The arts and culture organizations have tried to maintain their mission (often publicly funded) to provide access to cultural heritage for the community, maintain the safety of their employees and the public and help artists when possible.
In March 2020, the world and at various levels, museums, bookshops, performance sites, and other cultural institutions were indefinitely closed with their exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed.
In response, intensive efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent impact and high acceleration of the disease is the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events, and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences and fashion events.
The film industry also experienced an interruption. The Vatican announced that the rites of the Holy Week in Rome, which would occur during the last week of the Christian Lent period, had been cancelled.
Many dioceses have recommended that elderly Christians stay at home rather than attend Mass on Sundays; some churches have provided church services via radio, live streaming online or on television while others offer drive-in cults.
With the Catholic Diocese of Rome closing its churches and chapels and the square of St Peter empty without Christian pilgrims, other religious organs also cancelled the services and limited public agglomerations in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
The Ministry of Health of Iran announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak and shrines were subsequently closed, while Saudi Arabia prohibited the entry of foreign pilgrims as well as their residents in holy places in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most significant interruption in the world sports calendar since World War II.
Most of the major events were cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-2020 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-2020 Premier League, the 2019-2020 NBA season, and the 2019-2020 NHL season.
The outbreak interfered with the plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, originally scheduled to start at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event would be \"rescheduled to a date after 2020, but not after the summer of 2021 - Casinos and other world-wide gaming venues were closed and present poker tournaments were also postponed or cancelled.
This has led many players to play online, with several websites of online games reporting significant increases in their new registration rates. The entertainment industry has also been affected, with various music groups suspending or canceling their tournaments.
Many great theaters like Broadway also canceled all the shows.
Some artists have explored ways to continue to produce and share their work on the internet as an alternative to traditional live performances, such as live broadcast shows or creating \"festivals\" online for artists to present themselves, share and disseminate their work.
On-line, several memes on the internet about coronavirus are propagated, as many seek humor and entertainment in the midst of uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, an increase in prejudice, xenophobia and racism has been observed for people of Chinese or East Asian descent and for people of the focus areas in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents of fear, distrust, and hostility have been observed in many countries, especially in Europe, eastern Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
February results (when most cases were still restricted to China) recorded racist feelings expressed in various groups around the world about the Chinese people deserve the virus or are receiving a fair punishment for what they caused.
Some countries in Africa also identified an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
This has been supported by Chinese, both online and offline, and is directed to those in areas affected by the virus.
Following the advance of the outbreak in new countries, the citizens of Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a serious outbreak of COVID-19, could also be subject to mistrust and xenophobia. Citizens of countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions pressuring the ban on Chinese entry into their countries in an attempt to contain the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan went to Twitter Trending Topics.
The Chinese people, as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States, reported increasing levels of racist insults as well as attacks.
US President Donald Trump was criticized for referring to coronavirus as the \"Chinese virus\" a term considered by critics as racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and evacuees from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from the northeast of India, bordering with China, and students in the large cities of India supposedly suffered persecution related to the outbreak of coronavirus.
The president of the unity in the state of the Bharatiya Janata Party in Western Bengal, Dilip Ghosh, said that the Chinese destroyed nature and - that is why God turned against them -
The comments were then condemned by the Chinese Consulate in Calcutta, who called it \"misleaders\" in China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese inhabitants were inflamed by the pandemic, with foreigners called \"foreign lice\" and \"dispatch targets\"
Many newspapers with paid access have removed them from some or all coverages on the coronavirus.
Several scientific editors have made available scientific articles related to the outbreak with open access.
Some scientists have opted to share their conclusions as soon as possible on preprints servers, such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory analyses for the Coronary Virus Respiratory Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) and the associated SARS - COV-2 virus include methods that detect the presence of the virus and those that detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of the virus in samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and developed only to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
The detection of antibodies (sorology) can be used for diagnosis and population monitoring.
Antibody tests reveal how many people had the disease, including those whose symptoms were very mild to be reported or who became asymptomatic.
An accurate rate of mortality of the disease and the level of herd immunity in the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to the limited testing, in March 2020 no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
On 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there were considerable variations in the number of tests carried out in countries.
This variability probably still substantially affects the mortality rates of registered cases, which may be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Using the polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcription in real time (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed in respiratory samples obtained by different methods, including nasopharynx scrubbing or saliva sample.
The results are usually available within a few hours or in 2 days.
The RT-PCR test performed with pharynx rubbing is only reliable in the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus may disappear in the throat as it continues to multiply in the lungs.
For infected people tested in the second week, as an alternative, the sample material may be removed from the bottom of the airways by suction catheter or material released by expectoration (secretion) can be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed in Charité, in Berlin, in January 2020 using the polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcription in real time (rRT-PCR), and serves as the basis for 250,000 kits for distribution by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK also developed a test on January 23, 2020. The South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical type, a SARS-COV-2 detection kit based on PCR (PowerCheck Coronavirus) on January 28, 2020.
He looks for the gene (E) shared by all beta coronaviruses, and the RdRp gene, specific to SARS-CoV-2. In China, the BGI group was one of the first companies to receive emergency approval from the Chinese National Medical Products Administration for the SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on PCR. In the United States, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing its innovative diagnostic panel for the Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) of RT-PCR in real-time for public health laboratories by the International Reagent Resource.
One of the three genetic tests in older versions of the test kits generated inconclusive tests based on failure reagents, and an obstacle in testing at the CDC in Atlanta; this resulted in an average of less than 100 samples per day being successfully processed throughout February 2020.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, and only from then on were the local and state laboratories allowed to start the tests.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency authorisation. Commercial laboratories began testing at the beginning of March 2020.
From 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the national availability of the test for COVID-19 based on RT-PCR.
Quest Diagnostics also made the tests for COVID-19 nationally available from 9 March 2020.
No quantity restriction has been announced; the collection and processing of samples should be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Research Centre in Virology and Biotechnology, VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Surveillance Service. On 12 March 2020, Mayo Clinic stated that it had developed a test to detect the infection by COVID-19. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received an FDA approval for a test that could be carried out within 3.5 hours on a large scale, thus allowing a machine to process approximately 4,128 tests within 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) for Abbott laboratories for a test in Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA previously issued an authorisation for Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid also received an FDA US for a test that takes about 45 minutes.
The FDA approved a test using isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
As it does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method can generate positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these machines in the USA and Abbott expects to increase production to provide 50,000 tests per day. A test using a monoclonal antibody and the particular binding to the protein of the nucleocapsid (protein N) of the new coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan, with the expectation of delivering results in 15 to 20 minutes such as a rapid flu test.
A literature review in March 2020 concluded that - chest X-rays have a lower diagnostic value in early stages, while CT findings, computed tomography, may be present even before symptoms arise -
Typical features in CT include bilateral opacitys in dark glass with a posterior, peripheral and asymmetric distribution.
Subpleural dominance, mosaic pavement and consolidation evolve as the disease progresses.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan at the point of origin of the current pandemic suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than the PCR, although less specific, with many of its imaging aspects matching with other pneumonia and pathological processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that ‘TC should not be used for screening or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19’ - Since March 2020, the CDC recommends the PCR for initial verification.
Part of the immune response to infection is the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to detect infection in individuals initiated 7 days ago or soon after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity, and the monitoring of the population. Tests can be performed in central laboratories (CLTs) or through remote laboratory tests (PoCTs).
The automated high productivity systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these tests, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For CLT, a single peripheral blood sample is commonly used, although numerous samples can be used to monitor the immune response.
For PoCT, a single blood sample is usually obtained by skin puncture.
Unlike the PCR methods, the collection stage is not required before the test. On 26 March 2020, the FDA indicated 29 entities that notified the agency, as required, and from now on are able to distribute their antibody tests.
As of 7 April 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA with an emergency authorisation. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approvals for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies for the virus in blood samples.
The testing capacity is of several hundred samples in a matter of hours and therefore much faster than conventional PCR viral RNA tests.
Antibodies are usually detected 14 days after the onset of infection. In early April, the United Kingdom considered that none of the kits of antibodies tests purchased were suitable enough to be used.
Hong Kong organized a system in which suspected patients can stay home, the emergency department will give a sampling tube to the patient - they must expel saliva in the tube, send it back and get a result soon after. The British NHS announced that it is coordinating a system to test suspicious cases at home, which eliminates the risk of a patient infecting others if they are in the hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance if any is used. In the drive-thru tests for COVID-19 in suspicious cases, a health professional collects samples taking appropriate precautions.
Drive-thru centers have helped South Korea carry out some of the fastest and most comprehensive tests in one country. In Germany, the National Association of Health Insurance Status Doctors stated on March 2 that it had the capacity for about 12,000 tests per day in outpatient care, and 10,700 had been tested in the previous week.
The costs are borne by the health insurance when the test is requested by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity for 160,000 tests per week.
Since 19 March, drive-in tests have been offered in several large cities.
Since 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany remains unknown, since only positive tests are recorded.
The first research laboratory revealed that since the 12th week of 2020 a total of 483.295 samples were tested by 12th week 2020 and 33.491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers from the Technoion and Rambam hospitals developed and tested a method to test samples of 64 patients simultaneously, gathering samples and carrying out additional tests only if the combined sample was considered positive. In Wuhan, an improvised laboratory of 2000 m2 for emergency detection called \"Huo-Yan\" (Chinese: xxx, or \"Fire Eye\" in English) was opened on 5 February 2020 by BGI, which can process more than 10,000 samples per day.
With the construction supervised by the founder of BGI, Wang Jian, and taking 5 days, the modeling revealed that the cases in Hubei would have been 47% higher and the corresponding cost to deal with quarantine would have doubled if this testing capacity did not have an online access.
Wuhan laboratory was promptly followed by Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai in a total of 12 cities throughout China.
On March 4, 2020, the total daily yield was 50,000 tests per day. Open source multiplexed models released by Origami Assays were launched as capable of testing up to 1,122 samples of patients for COVID-19, using only 93 tests. These balanced models can be performed in small laboratories without the need for robotic handlers for liquids.
In March, the shortage or insufficient amounts of reagent became a barrier to mass testing in the European Union, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This led some authors to study the sample preparation protocols involving the heating of the samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genomes for additional tests. On March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates are now doing more per capita testing in their population for the Coronavirus than other countries, and would be on their way to increasing the level of testing and reaching most of the population.
This was due to a combination of drive-thru capacity, and acquisition of a laboratory for mass processing of population scale of Group 42 and BGI (inspired by their emergency detection laboratories -Huo-Yan - in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is able to conduct tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first in the world of this scale to function outside China.
Different test methods aimed at different components of the genetic profile of the coronavirus were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the method of manufacturing kits sent to low-income countries that have no recourse to develop their own.
The German method was released on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Center for Disease Control was not available until 28 January, there was delay in the tests available for the US and for China and the United States faced problems with the reliability of the test kits at the beginning of the outbreak, and these countries with Australia failed to provide sufficient kits to meet the demand and test recommendations made by health professionals.
On the other hand, experts claim that the wide availability of South Korea for testing has helped reduce the spread of the new kronavirus.
The test capacity, largely in the laboratories of the private sector, has been consolidated over many years by the government of South Korea.
On March 16, the World Health Organization indicated the strengthening of testing programs as the best way to delay the advancement of the VOC-19 pandemic. The high demand for tests due to the wide spread of the virus caused the delay of hundreds of thousands of tests in private US laboratories, and the supply of cotton and chemical reagents was affected.
In March 2020, China reported problems with accuracy in its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC presented \"failures\" the government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that prevented the particular tests. Spain acquired test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but considered the results imprecise.
The company explained that the incorrect results could be a consequence of a failure in the collection of samples or the incorrect use of kits.
The Spanish minister said he would cancel the kits that generated incorrect results and replace them with a different test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic purchased from China generated wrong results. Slovakia acquired 1.2 million test kits from China considered imprecise.
Prime Minister Matovic suggested that they would be discarded in the Danube. Ates Kara of the Ministry of Health of Turkey said that the test kits of Turkey purchased from China had a \"high error fee\" and that it would not use them. The United Kingdom acquired 3.5 million test kits from China, but at the beginning of April 2020 it announced that they were not useful.
The testing, followed by quarantine of those who tested positive and monitoring those with whom positive people for SARS-CoV-2 had contact, had positive results.
The researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the site of the first death by COVID-19 in Italy, performed two test stages of the entire population of approximately 3,400 people, with an interval of about ten days.
About half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms, and all discovered cases were quarantined.
With the displacement to the restricted commune, this eliminated new infections completely.
With the aggressive monitoring of contact, travel restrictions to the country, testing and quarantine, the kronavirus pandemic in 2020 in Singapore has advanced much slower than in other developed countries, and without radical restrictions such as the mandatory closure of restaurants and sales establishments.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore began to seriously advise the inhabitants to stay home on 28 March, but schools reopened within the expected after the holiday on 23 March.
Many other countries have also managed the pandemic with aggressive contact monitoring, travel restrictions to the country, testing and quarantine, but with less aggressive lockdowns, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study identified that the countries that carried out more tests, in relation to the number of deaths, had more lower mortality rates, probably because these countries are better able to detect those with none or little symptom.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have testing capacity and have national laboratories with limited experience in COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and the first ten negative samples for one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmatory tests.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the column - Positive in % of tests - is influenced by the testing policy of the countries.
A country that only tests people admitted to hospitals will have a higher percentage of positive tests than a country that has tested all citizens, whether or not they have symptoms, the other characteristics are equivalent.
Washing hands (or cleaning hands), also known as hand hygiene, is the act of washing hands in order to remove dirt, fat, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
The washing of hands with soap constantly in certain - critical moments - during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by oro-fecal route.
People can also be infected with respiratory diseases such as flu or a common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucosa).
The five crucial moments during the day when washing hands with soap is important include: before and after the defecation, after cleaning the child's bum or changing diapers, before feeding a child, before meals and before and after preparing the food or handling meat, frank or raw fish.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be toiletized with ashes. The World Health Organization recommends hand hygiene:
Before, during and after preparing the food.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After changing diapers or cleaning a child who used the bathroom.
After blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing.
After touching animals, food or animal discards.
Clinical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before administering medicines or medical care may prevent or minimize the spread of diseases.
The main purpose of washing hands is to clean the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause diseases) and chemicals that can cause damage or diseases.
This is particularly important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronary virus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and decreasing the infant mortality rate in childbirths made at home.
A 2013 study revealed that best practices for handwashing can lead to small improvements in the growth of children under five years of age.
In developed countries, infant mortality rates related to diarrhoea and respiratory diseases can be reduced by simply introducing behavioral changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple attitude can reduce the mortality rate of these diseases by almost 50%.
Interventions that promote handwashing can reduce diarrhea episodes in about one third, which is comparable to providing clean water for poor areas.
48% of reductions in diarrhea episodes may be associated with handwashing with soap. Washing hands with soap is the most effective and economical way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (IRA), such as automatic behavior performed in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, the primary IRA, is the first cause of mortality among children under five, taking the life of estimated 1.8 million children per year.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia together are responsible for nearly 3.5 million deaths of children annually.
According to UNICEF, transforming handwashing with soap before eating and after using the bathroom into a deep-rooted habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, reducing deaths by diarrhea almost half and deaths of acute respiratory infections in one room.
Washing of hands is usually associated with other sanitary interventions as part of the water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programs.
Washing hands also protects against the impetigo that is transmitted by direct physical contact.
A less significant negative effect of handwashing is that frequent hand washing can cause skin damage due to skin resection.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive handwashing can lead to a condition of decameration and irritation in the skin known as eczema or hand dermatitis, which is particularly common among health system workers.
Frequent handwashing is also perceived as one of the symptoms of compulsive obsessive disorder (TOC).
There are five crucial moments during the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce fecal-oral transmission of diseases: after using the bathroom (mixing, defecation), after cleaning a child's bum (threaking diapers), before feeding a child, before eating and before/after preparing a food or handling meat, fish or raw chicken.
Other situations where the correct technique for handwashing should be practiced in order to prevent the transmission of diseases include the before and after treating a cut or wound; after sneezing, coughing or blowing the nose; after touching animal discards or dealing with animals; and after touching in garbage.
In many countries, there is a reduced rate of hand washing with soap.
A study on hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that, on average, 38.7% of families had the habit of washing their hands with soap. A 2014 study revealed that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of 97 percent; the United States was close to the average of 77 percent; and China with the lowest rate of 23 percent. Various methods for behavioural changes currently exist to increase acceptance of the habit of washing their hands with soap in critical periods. Collective hand washing for children in schools in certain periods of the day is an alternative in developing countries to instill handwashing in children's habits.
The Essential Health Services Program - implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of a large-scale action to promote the health and education of children.
The deparasition twice a year, complemented by the washing of hands daily with soap, the brushing of the teeth daily with fluoride, is in the center of this national program.
It was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from the skin is reinforced by adding soaps and detergents to the water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce the barriers to the solution, and increase solubility.
Water alone is an ineffective cleaning agent for the skin, because fats and proteins, components of organic dirt, are not easily dissolved in water.
Cleaning is, however, facilitated by a reasonable flow of water...
The bar soap, depending on its reusable nature, can retain the accumulated bacteria from previous uses.
A small number of studies that analyzed the bacterial transmission of a contaminated bar soap concluded that transmission is unlikely since bacteria are rinsed with foam.
The CDC repeats - liquid soap with automatic dosing commands is preferable -
Antibacterial soaps have been widely disseminated to the conscious public in terms of health.
So far, there are no indications that using recommended antiseptics or disinfectants may lead to the selection of antibiotic resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of resistant strains of organisms.
Thus, even if antibiotic resistant strains are not selected by antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as they are disclosed.
In addition to surfactants and skin protection agents, complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as a regulator of pH, benzoic active antimicrobial acid and other skin moisturizers (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).A comprehensive analysis of the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that common soaps are as effective in preventing diseases and removing bacteria from the hands as antibacterial soaps aimed at the final consumer containing triclosan.
Hot water that is comfortable for handwashing is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow faster at body temperature (37 oC).
However, hot water with soap is more effective than cold water with soap to remove the natural oiliness that holds dirt and bacteria.
Unlike popular belief, however, scientific studies have shown that using hot water is not effective in reducing microbial load in hands.
A hand sanitizer or antiseptic is a non-aqueous basic hand hygiene agent.
At the end of the 1990s and at the beginning of the 21st century, non-aqueous basic hand hygiene agents based on alcohol (also known as a product for the hygiene of hands based on alcohol, a product for the hygiene of antiseptic hands, or hand hygiene) began to gain popularity.
Most are made from isopropyl or ethanol alcohol formulated with a thickening agent, such as carbomer (polymer or acrylic acid), gel, or a moisturizer, such as glycerin, liquid, or foam to facilitate the use and reduce the effect of alcohol resecting.
The addition of hydrogen peroxide increases the antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers containing a minimum of 60 to 95% alcohol kill germs with efficiency.
Alcohol-based sanitizers kill bacteria, multi-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol-based hygienizers containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% (reduction of 3.5 logarithms, similar to 35 decibels) of the bacteria in their hands, 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (reduction of 4 to 5 logarithms) of the bacteria in their hands 1 minute after application. The hand sanitizers are more effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost entirely ineffective against the norovirus (or Norwalk) virus, the most common cause of contagious gastroenteritis. Antiseptics for hands or alcohol-based hygiene agents can be used to moisten or cover both hands well.
The backs and palms of the hands, between the fingers and their extremities are rubbed for approximately 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is dry.
The fingers should also be thoroughly washed, being rubbed with both palms. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing with hand sanitizers, especially when hands are visually dirty.
The increasing use of these agents is based on its ease of use and rapid exterminating action against micro-organisms; however, they should not replace the proper washing of hands unless soap and water are available.
The frequent use of hand sanitizers based on alcohol may cause skin resection, unless skin emollients and/or moisturizers are added to the formula.
The effect of resecting alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, hand sanitizers based on alcohol containing emollients caused substantially less irritation and resection in the skin than soaps or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or alcohol hypersensitivity, or additives present in hand hygiene based alcohol rarely occur.
The lower tendency to provoke irritative contact dermatitis has become an attractive one compared to hand washing with soap and water.
Despite its effectiveness, non-aqueous base agents do not clean the hands of organic matter, only disinfect them.
This is why hand sanitizers are not as effective as water and soap to prevent the spread of many pathogens, since pathogens still remain in their hands.
The efficacy of hand sanitizers without alcohol is highly dependent on substances and formulation, and historically has been very low on alcohol and alcohol-based hygiene.
More recently, formulations that use benzalconium chloride have revealed continuous and cumulative antimicrobial action after application, unlike alcohol, which has shown its reduced efficacy after recurrent use, probably due to increasing adverse reactions in the skin.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford a soap and instead use ash or land.
Ash or earth can be more effective than pure water, but they can be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if land or ash are contaminated with microorganisms the spread of the disease may increase rather than decrease.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant agent, since in contact with water it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends as an alternative to soap when there is no soap.
The correct technique for handwashing recommended by the US Center for Disease Control to prevent disease transmission includes the following steps:
Wash your hands with cold or hot running water.
It is recommended running water as fixed washbasins may be contaminated, while water temperature does not seem relevant.
Rub your hands, frying them with a generous amount of soap, including the back of your hands, the space between your fingers and under your nails.
The soap removes the germs from the skin, and studies reveal that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap instead of pure water.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
The act of rubbing generates friction, which helps to remove the germs from the skin, and rub for a longer time removes more germs.
Drink well with running water.
Washing in a sink can re-contaminated your hands.
Dry with a dry towel or let dry outdoors.
Wet or wet hands are more easily recontaminated. The most commonly forgotten areas are thumb, wrist, areas between fingers and under nails.
Artificial and glazed enamels can house microorganisms.
It is often recommended moisturizing lotion to keep hands hydrated; dry skin may cause skin lesions capable of increasing the risk of transmission of infection.
Several low-cost options can be made to facilitate handwashing where there is no running water and/or soap, for example, pouring water from a gallon or knead with appropriate holes and/or using ash if necessary in developing countries. In situations with restricted water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions for storing water, such as -improvised screws - and other low-cost options.
An improvised faucet is a simple technology that uses a jar suspended by a rope, and a lever powered by the feet to clear a small amount of water into the hands and a soap bar.
The effective drying of hands is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is a discussion about the most effective form for drying in public toilets.
An increasing volume of research suggests that towel papers are much more hygienic than the electric hand dryers found in many bathrooms.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the towel paper industry, European Tissue Symposium, to compare the levels of hygiene presented by the paper towel, hand dryers with heated air and the most modern hand dryers with air jet.
After washing and drying hands with heated air dryer, the total number of bacteria was considered, on average, 194% higher in the palm area near the fingers and 254% in the rest of the palm.
Drying with air jet dryers led to an increase in the total number of bacteria, on average, of 42% in the palm area near the fingers and about 15% in the rest of the palm.
After washing and drying hands with towel paper, the total number of bacteria was reduced, on average, by up to 76% in the palm area near the fingers and up to 77% in the rest of the palm. Researchers also conducted tests to define whether there was cross contamination potential among other users and the bathroom environment as a consequence of each type of drying method.
The air-jet dryer, which designs air outside the unit at indicated speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), managed to expel microorganisms from the hands and the unit potentially contaminating other users of the bathroom and the environment up to 2 meters away.
The use of hand dryer with hot air spreads microorganisms up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
The towel papers did not present a significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Produkt and Umwelt, different methods for hand drying were evaluated.
The following changes in bacterial count after hand drying were observed:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers were compared with drying with towel paper.
Washing hands with hand-wetted hand sanitizers is an alternative to lack of soap and water during travel.
Hand sanitizers based on alcohol must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Clinical handwashing became mandatory long after Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its efficacy (in 1846) in the prevention of diseases in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind the hospital team to wash their hands when they forget.
One study found that infection rates decreased with their use.
The clinical washing of hands is for a minimum of 15 seconds, using generous amounts of soap and water or gel to drain and rub all the parts of the hands.
The hands should be rubbed simultaneously with the interlacing of the fingers.
If there are residues under the nails, a brush can be used to remove them.
As germs can remain in the water in the hands, it is important to rinse well and dry with a clean towel.
After drying, the towel paper should be used to close the faucet (and open the door if necessary).
This prevents the recontamination of hands by these surfaces.
The aim of handwashing in the medical care environment is to remove pathogenic microorganisms - germs - and avoid their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the lack of hand washing remains at unacceptable levels in most medical environments, with a large number of doctors and nurses constantly forgetting to wash their hands before touching the patients, thus transmitting microorganisms.
One study revealed that proper hand washing and other simple procedures may decrease the rate of bloodstream infections related to catheter in 66 percent. The World Health Organization published a bulletin demonstrating the pattern of hand washing and friction in the health system sectors.
The organization's hand hygiene guidance project can also be found on this website for reviews.
An applicable review was carried out by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices may measure and validate hand hygiene if the demonstration of regulatory compliance is required.
The World Health Organization defines -Five moments - for handwashing:
after exposure to body fluids/bloods
before an ascetic task, and
after patient care. The addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap (sabonetes -medicines - or -antimicrobials - gives an exterminating action to a hand washing agent.
Such exterminating action may be desirable before performing surgery or in situations in which antibiotic resistant organisms are predominant. To - clear - the hands for a surgical operation it is necessary to have a faucet that can be opened and closed without touching it with hands, some antiseptics of chlorexidine or iodine, sterilized towels to dry hands after washing, and a sterilized brush for cleaning and other sterilized instruments for cleaning under nails.
All jewels must be removed.
This procedure requires washing hands and forearms up to elbows, usually 2-6 minutes.
A very long cleaning time (10 minutes) is not necessary.
At the time of washing, the water in the forearms should not run into the hands.
After handwashing is completed, the hands are rinsed with a sterilized towel and the surgical robe is dressed.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after attending a sick person.
In order to control staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that there was a greater benefit of hand cleaning in the first 20% washing, and a significant additional benefit was obtained when the cleaning frequency exceeded 35%.
Washing with common soap more than triples the rate of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted for food compared to washing with an antibacterial soap. Comparing hand hygiene with an alcohol-based solution with hand washing with an antibacterial soap for an average time of 30 seconds for each revealed that hand hygiene based on alcohol reduced bacterial contamination by 26% to more than an antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than hand sanitizers based on alcohol to reduce influenza A virus, H1N1, and Clostridium spores difficult in the hands. Interventions to increase hand hygiene in hospital environments may involve the team's awareness of hand washing, increased availability of hand sanitizers based on alcohol and verbal warnings and written to the team.
There is a need for more research on which interventions are more efficient in different health institutions.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap is considered an essential, economically viable tool for good health and even better nutrition.
However, the absence of reliable sources of water, soap or resources for handwashing in people's homes, schools and workplaces makes this a challenge for the achievement of the universal practice of hand washing.
For example, in most rural Africa, taps for hand washing close to any public or private bathrooms are rare, although there are cheap options for building hand washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates may instead be the result of entrenched habits and not the absence of soap and water.
The encouragement and defense of handwashing with soap can influence political decisions, lead to awareness about the benefits of hand washing and lead to a change in the long-term behavior of the population.
For this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are necessary.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective in increasing handwashing in low- and middle-income countries, while social marketing campaigns are less efficient. An example for promoting hand washing in schools is the \"three-star approach\" of UNICEF that encourages schools to take simple and cheap steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other hygienic requirements.
When a minimum level is reached, schools can go from one to the top three stars.
Construction of hand-washing stations can be a part of the promotional hand-washing campaigns carried out in order to reduce disease and infant mortality.
The global day for handwashing is another example of awareness campaign that attempts to achieve a change of habit. As a result of the 2019-2020 kronavirus pandemic, UNICEF disclosed the adoption of an emoji for hand washing.
Few studies have considered the overall cost/benefit ratio of hand washing in developing countries in relation to the DALY classification.
However, an analysis suggests that promoting the washing of hands with soap is significantly more profitable than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of handwashing for human health — especially for people in vulnerable circumstances as mothers who have just given birth or wounded soldiers in hospitals — was initially recognized in the middle of the 19th century by two precursors of hand hygiene: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the English - the founder of modern nursing -
At that time, people still believed that infections were caused by unpleasant odors called myasmas.
In the 1980s, food-related outbreaks and infections associated with health care led the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively encourage hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infections.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COPID-19 pandemic in 2020 have led to an increase in awareness in many countries of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect themselves from such infectious diseases.
For example, posters for proper hand washing were hung close to sinks for hand washing in public toilets and in office and airport building toilets in Germany.
The expression - handwashing - means declaring reluctance to take responsibility or to be compatible with something.
It originated from the biblical passage in Matthew, where Pontius Pilate washed the hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but became a more general phrase of use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth starts handwashing compulsively in an attempt to clean up an imaginary stain, representing her guilty conscience regarding the crimes she had committed and led her husband to commit.
It was also found that people, after remembering or witnessing unethical acts, tend to wash their hands more frequently than others, and usually give more importance to handwashing equipment.
In addition, those who can wash their hands after such a vision are less likely to perform other compensatory acts of “cleanup” such as volunteering.
Religions prescribe handwashing for hygienic and symbolic purposes. The symbolic washing of hands, using water, but not soap, to wash hands is part of a ritual washing of hands characteristic in many religions, including Bahá'í faith, Hinduism, tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, the lavage in Christianity, and the ablution in Islamism. Religions also indicate the hygienic washing of hands, especially after some actions.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam authorize handwashing after use of the bathroom.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Islam authorize handwashing before and after meals.
Hazard controls at work for COVID-19
Hazard controls at work for COVID-19 are the application of health and safety methodologies at work for hazard controls for the prevention of coronary virus disease of 2019 (COVID-19).
The appropriate hazard controls at the workplace depend on the workplace and the work itself, based on the risk assessment of the sources of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community, and the risk factors of individual workers, which may be vulnerable to the contraction of COVID-19.
According to the Department of Health and Labour Safety (OSHA), functions with lower risk of exposure have minimal occupational contact with the public and other work colleagues, for which basic prevention measures of infection are recommended, including hand washing, encourage employees to stay home if they are sick, maintain a respiratory label and a routine of cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
Functions with medium exposure risk include those that require frequent or direct contact with people who are not known whether they are contaminated or suspected of contamination with VOC-19, but may be infected due to current community transmission or travelling abroad.
This includes workers who maintain contact with the general public as in schools, high-density working environments, and in the retail market of large volumes.
Hazard controls for this group, in addition to the basic prevention measures of infection, include ventilation with high-efficiency air filters, protective covers and provision of individual protective equipment if a person is confirmed with COVID-19.
The OSHA considers that workers in the health system and morgues who are exposed to people with confirmed or suspected CVID-19 are at high risk of exposure, which increases the risk of exposure to very high if the workers perform procedures in people with COVID-19 confirmed or suspected generation of aerosols and collect or handle specimens of these people.
Suitable hazard controls for these workers include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and individual protective equipment suitable for the work performed.
The COVID-19 epidemic may have various effects on the workplace.
Workers may be absent from work because they are sick, because they have to take care of other people, or because of fear of possible exposure.
Trade patterns can change, both in terms of which products are in demand as well as the means of purchasing such products (such as buying out of peak time or delivery or drive-thru services.
Finally, sending items from areas severely affected by COVID-19 can be interrupted. An action plan and preparation for infectious disease can be used to guide protection actions.
The plans address the risk levels associated with the various workplaces and tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors that arise at home and in the community, and risk factors for individual workers such as advanced age or chronic medical conditions.
They also define the controls necessary to address these risks, and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of epidemics.
Action plans and preparation for infectious diseases may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
The objectives for action for an epidemic include reducing transmission among employees, protecting people who are at greater risk of developing health complications, maintaining business operations and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community, where the company is located, affects the actions taken.
The hierarchy of hazard controls is a widely used structure in health and safety of work to group hazard controls by efficacy.
When the dangers of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls and finally individual protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve the isolation of workers from work-related hazards without relying on the behavior of the worker, and can be the most economical implementation solution.
Engineering controls are changes in the policy or working procedures that require the work of the worker or employer.
Individual protective equipment (EPI) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can help prevent certain exposures.
All types of PPE should be selected on the basis of the hazard to the worker, adjusted as necessary (e.g. respirators), used properly and continuously, inspected regularly, preserved and replaced as necessary, and removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of properly to prevent contamination.
According to the U.S. Department of Health and Labour Safety (OSHA), low-risk jobs have minimal occupational contact with the public and other work partners.
Basic measures to prevent infection recommended for all workplaces include frequent and meticulous handwashing, incentives for workers to stay home if they are sick and use of the respiratory label, including sneezing and coughing, preparation of sheets and for common waste, preparation for teleworking or staggered shifts, where necessary, disincentive of the use of tools and equipment from other workers, and maintenance of a routine of cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
The rapid identification and isolation of potentially infected individuals is an essential step in protecting workers, clients, visitors and other people at the workplace.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory disease stay home until they have no more fever, signs of fever or any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of medication to reduce the fever or relief of other symptoms, and also recommends that sick leave policies be flexible, allow employees to stay home to care for a sick member of the family, and that they become aware of these policies.
According to OSHA, studies with average exposure risk include those that require frequent or direct contact of 6 feet (1.8 m) with people who are not known whether they are confirmed or suspected patients with COVID-19, but may be infected by SARS-COV-2 due to the current community transmission in the company's locality, or because the individual has a recent history of travel abroad, in a country with a high transmission of COVID-19.
These include workers who have contact with the general public as in schools, high-population work environments and some high-volume sales retail stores. Engineering controls for this group and for higher-risk groups include the installation of high-efficiency air filters, the increase of ventilation, the installation of physical barriers, such as transparent plastic sanitary antepauses and the installation of a drive-thru window for customer service. Administrative controls for this group and groups of higher risk include the incentive for workers to stay at home, the replacement of face-to-face meetings by virtual communication, the establishment of staggered shifts, the cancellation of non-essential trips to sites with a current VOD-19 epidemic, the development of communication plans, including a forum for responding to workers' doubts, the replacement of actual meetings by virtual communication, the establishment of non-essential travel to sites with a current VOD-19 epidemic, the development of communication plans for this group and the provision of protection of the workers and the constant use of the equipment, the amount of the amount of protection and the amount of the constant duty, and the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the service, and of the service, and of the service, which the service, the service, the service, the amount of the amount of the amount of the service, the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the
Workers in this risk group rarely need breathers.
If a person gets sick on a plane, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include the isolation of the sick person from other people by a distance of 6 feet, with the designation of a crew member to serve the sick person and offer her a facial mask, or ask the sick person to cover his or her mouth and nose with scar tissue or sneezing.
The crew shall use disposable medical gloves when serving a sick passenger or touching body fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces and, possibly, additional individual protective equipment if the patient has a fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be discarded in a bag for biological risk residues, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards. For commercial transport, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, hazard controls include the postponement of the journey by the sick passenger, self-insulation and immediate communication to the medical centre on board if someone presents fever or other symptoms during the journey.
The ideal is that medical follow-up occurs in the cabin of the isolated person. For schools and child care centers, the CDC recommends the temporary closure for cleaning and disinfection if an infected person was present in the building, regardless of the spread of the virus in the community.
When there is minimal to moderate community transmission, social distance strategies can be implemented, such as the cancellation of field trips, assemblies, and other large groupings such as physical or choral education classes, or meals in a snack, increasing the space between tables, more rigid arrival and departure times, limitation of non-essential visitors and the use of a separate health care location for children with flu-like symptoms.
When there is significant transmission in the local community, in addition to social distance strategies, prolonged school dispensation can be considered. For law enforcement authorities carrying out daily activities, the risk to immediate health is considered low by the CDC.
It is recommended that police officers who contact individuals suspected of COVID-19 or with the confirmed disease follow the same guides as emergency medicine technicians, including the use of appropriate individual protective equipment.
If direct contact occurs during the seizure, workers should clean and disinfect their belt and other accessories before using them again using a common household cleaning spray or cloth and follow the standard operating procedures for the containment and disposition of PPE used and for the containment and washing of clothing.
OSHA considers certain health workers and morgues to be in high or very high risk categories of exposure.
Functions with high risk of exposure include workers delivering medicines, medical care, laboratories and medical transportation, who are exposed to patients with confirmed or suspected CVID-19.
The risk of exposure becomes very high if workers perform aerosol generation procedures in patients with confirmed or suspected VOC-19, or collect or handle specimens of these patients.
Aerosol generation procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations or invasive specimen collection.
Works in high-exposure morgues include workers involved in the preparation of bodies of people with confirmed COVID-19 or suspected of the disease at the time of their death; the risk of exposure becomes very high if they perform autopsy. Additional engineering controls for these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 disease, including when aerosol generating procedures are performed.
Specialized ventilation of negative pressure can be appropriate in some scenarios of morgues and in the health area.
Specimens should be handled with caution of level 3 biosecurity.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients who enter the hospital be separated into two different areas of waiting depending on whether they are a suspicious case for COVID-19. In addition to other PPEs, OSHA recommends respirators for professionals who work at a distance of 6 feet from patients with confirmation or suspicion of SARS-COV-2 infection, and for professionals who perform aerosol generation procedures.
In the United States, facial respirators with N95 particle filtration, approved by NIOSH or upper-quality breathing must be used in the context of a comprehensive and written respiratory protection program that includes adjustment tests, training and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide protection and improve the worker's comfort. WHO does not recommend the use of macacoons, since COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, and is not transmitted by non-respiratory body fluids.
WHO recommends only a surgical mask for screening staff at the entry point.
For professionals who collect respiratory specimens, treat or transport patients with COVID-19 without aerosol generation procedures, WHO recommends a surgical mask, eyeglasses or facial protection, surgical apron and gloves.
If an aerosol generation procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced by a N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Since the overall supply of PPEs is insufficient, WHO recommends the minimization of the need for PPEs through telemedicine, physical barriers as clear windows, allowing only those involved in direct care to patients to enter a room with a patient with COVID-19, using only the necessary PPE for the specific task, continuous use of the same respirator without removing it while dealing with several patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the supply chain of PPE and destimulating the use of masks by asymptomatic individuals.

ASSESSMENT: [Covid-19] Dealing with problems and preparing for the future
DATE/TURN: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
LICENCE: CC0: No rights reserved
We meet under unusual circumstances this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is something that makes clear our global human interconnection and the responsibilities we have for the other.
Its challenges are unprecedented, but we know that our best actions go hand in hand with global empathy, cooperation and the creation of communities, which are the foundations of this organization.
The companionship and concern we have seen among all our colleagues through e-mails, links and conversations is a remarkable validation of the amazing human beings we have the privilege of working with.
I am immensely grateful and proud to have all of you as workmates.
Last week, someone shared with me your recognition for our work.
This person reminded me of how significant it is for the world to be able to access Wikipedia now, and how powerful a symbol that this essential resource continues online and available to everyone.
Your work makes this possible, because you keep the workplaces active, pay for our colleagues and maintain the safety of our communities.
The world needs the information Wikipedia provides, more than ever.
This is a moment when not only what we do but the way we do it will have a significant impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and its role in it, we will make important adjustments to the way we work together, starting next week.
Adjustments to our work and schedules
As Robyn mentioned earlier, Team C met last night to discuss our approach and schedules for the next few days and months.
At this meeting, we consider what we think to be an appropriate action to which we are experiencing and the best way to maintain sustainable organisation in this period.
We want to end stress and support our mission in the long run.
If you need to sit down for a while, it's okay.
For all employees, service providers and contract workers:
our daily job expectation will be 4 hours, or 20 hours a week, until it is arranged otherwise.
We're not declaring a holiday. If you can work on the normal schedule, it might be useful for our mission.
However, the world is unpredictable now, and if you need to take care of loved ones, buy groceries or go to the doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not monitoring your schedules.
If you're sick, don't work.
That rule would not have to be expressed, but we decided to declare it.
It is not necessary to attest or pay off. Just inform your manager to help your team review the schedule and times to ensure that the key areas of the work are met.
(If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, please inform Bryan of the training and certification sector so that his sector can help you and ensure that your situation receives appropriate management attention).
The staff who work an hour will receive full payment.
We have said this before, and we are committed to honouring our commitment to our employees and employees who work for an hour.
All will receive their salaries on the basis of their normal work record under normal circumstances.
Wages are independent if you're sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we give you full support.
Many people see work as a way to channel stress due to the current situation in the world.
The work we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in times like these.
Remembering that your well-being is more important.
We just ask you to contact your manager so we know what to expect and can help the activities properly.
Some functions are considered essential.
There are activities that we must continue to carry out.
The Sites, HR, Confidence and Security and Funding Engineering teams (among others) perform essential activities that may require additional support.
We will begin a process with all departments to evaluate current objectives and change our focus to support what is essential to our mission.
There is much to do for all of us, and we will focus our efforts on the most essential projects.
To slow down now won't harm us in the future.
We have no intention of ‘working double to recover lost time’ after the pandemic is over.
You will not be expected to work extra hours to meet deadlines that are now impractical.
We accept that the circumstances have changed, and we will work to define new goals and deadlines, as appropriate.
What will happen to the Annual Planning?
In order to adjust to our new reality and expectations of hours worked per day, we intend to adjust the schedule for the delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan, which will provide more time for the budget, and that employees prioritize the essential work, personal care and care of loved ones, while we accommodate those who need or want to work on a reduced journey in the coming weeks.
The extension of the schedule greatly reduces the current planning workloads and the pressure throughout the organization.
We will present our proposal to the board next week and update the representatives and teams on the next steps as soon as we have confirmation.
We thank the Annual Planning team for their leadership in this process.
Status, exhibition and cleaning of the office
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues from San Francisco may have been exposed to COVID-19 virus.
In view of this situation, by caution, we use an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in the office of San Francisco.
They used a special antiviral solution for hospitals to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the inlet tray and all elevators that give access to our floor.
The building is using its own care duty protocol using products that are safe for your viewers.
We are relieved that the office will be properly prepared for when we decide to return.
Our Washington office is located in a WeWork, which shared its protocol for COVID-19 with us and with all Washington officials.
Last week, our Washington office moved to a totally remote configuration in line with the shared guide with San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we're also discussing the location of an office in Brooklyn.
These discussions continue to take place, but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who have been working remotely for a long time know that it can be an adjustment, and they would like to offer some advice:
They shall limit the duration of meetings to not more than one or two hours.
If longer sessions are required, consider dividing them in several days.
They define the meeting, have a schedule and send in advance material for reading.
Use the videos as standard, with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and connection in real time.
Have a leader to facilitate the meetings, someone who monitors the questions in the chat and the list of participants, and someone to help make notes (or collaborative notes).
Send an e-mail to technical support if you need comfortable headphones.
Use your emergency help to buy snacks.
Participate in the #remotes channel to talk to your colleagues about remote work
HR operations team is researching ergonomics guides in the context of webinar to assist in increasing remote work in the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all community aid recipients to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as the editing marathons, until WHO declares the end of the pandemic.
We warned them that we understood that our request for cancellation and other restrictions could make it impossible to complete their agreed grant activities, and that no one would be penalized for prolonging or modifying their goals.
Next week, we will continue with additional guides on Wikimania and other regional and thematic conferences for the community.
The general feeling in the world community seems to be sad with the paralysis, but also of relief with the clarity and ability to maintain focus in their own communities, in Wikimedia and in other situations.
The communication resources team is working on creating a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and receive our communications to it.
Keeping up-to-date on issues related to COVID-19
We will send an invitation to your calendars for next Thursday at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special meeting with employees.
We will use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions and spend some time connecting with each other.
We're in this together and we'll help you with whatever you need.
Meanwhile, you can continue to find the information of this email and all other information related to COVID-19 on the company's wiki.
The communication resources team will update these pages and all the information in a single location.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with employees living in countries that are currently significantly affected.
If you have any questions about travel, events, a main workflow, or the coverage challenge, or anything else you may need help with, keep notifying it and working with the communication resources team.
We are here to help provide support and collaboration as needed.
If you have a confidential or sensitive subject, send an e-mail to Bryan Judah, Director of Global HR Operations.
None of these changes should be seen as abandoning our work and obligations.
They are, however, a recognition that, at this moment, our work and obligations will probably need to be adapted in a way that we do not adapt in the past.
These are the steps that we believe are needed as support at this time, so that we can continue to work, providing our movement with the support they need and providing the world with the service it depends on.
Our planned work will be waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to support each other and create room for important work that will be done in the weeks, and probably months after.
We need all of you to make this happen, so we need everyone to take care of yourself and your family so that they are in their best condition when needed.
Wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, communication resources team (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S), and the rest of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
The converting enzyme of type 2 angiotensin (ECA2) is an enzyme coupled with the outer surface (cell membranes) of the cells of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney, and intestines.
ECA2 neutralizes the activity of the related angiotensin converting enzyme (ECA) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and raising Ang (1-7), becoming a promising drug directed to the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ECA2 also acts as a point of entry into the cells for some coronaryviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hECA2.
Type 2 angiotensin converting enzyme is a metaloenzyme that contains zinc located on the surface of the endothelial and other cells.
The ECA2 protein contains a N-terminal M2 peptide domain and a C-terminal amino acid transporter and collectrine domain in the renal system.
ECA2 is a single passage membrane protein of type 1 with its enzymeally active domain exposed to the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ECA2 is cleaved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as sheddase, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and finally excreted in the urine.
ECA2 is present in many organs: ECA2 is coupled to the cell membrane of the main type II pulmonary alveolar cells, small intestine enterocytes, arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells in most organs.
The expression of ECA2 mRNA is also found in the cerebral cortex, striated body, hypothalamus, and brain stem.
The main function of ECA2 is to act as a counterweight for ECA.
The ECA cleaves the type I angiotensin hormone in type II angiotensin causing vasoconstriction.
ECA2 in turn cleaves phenylalanine of carboxitermine amino acid from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysis in vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-Gist-Pro-OH).
ECA2 also cleavages several other peptides, including [des-Arg9]- bradykinin, appelin, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and greline.
ECA2 also regulates the membrane transport of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and was involved in Hartnup's disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ECA2 functions as the main entry point in cells for some coronavirus, including HCOV-NL63; SARS-COV (the virus causing SARS); and SARS-COV-2 (the virus causing COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of SARS-CoV S1 and SARS-CoV2 to the enzyme domain of ECA2 on the cell surface results in endocytosis and translocation of the virus and enzyme into endosomas located within the cells.
This entry process also requires the preparation of S protein by the serine-protease host TMPRSS2, whose inhibition is under investigation as a potential therapy. This led some to raise the hypothesis that reducing ECA2 levels in cells, perhaps helps in the fight against infection.
However, several professional societies and regulatory bodies recommended continuing with the ACE inhibitor pattern and ARB therapy.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012 found that the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia in relation to controls -
In addition, the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who presented a high risk of contracting pneumonia, especially those with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with reduced pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less robust than for the overall risk of pneumonia -
Recombinant human ECA2 (rhACE2) is believed to be a new therapy for acute lung injury, and it appeared to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with an acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by lipopolysaccharide.
The half-life of rhACE2 in human beings is approximately 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes after the temporal evolution of effects (duration) of 24 hours.
Many findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for those with intolerance to the inhibitors of the classic renin-angiotensin system (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases in which angiotensin II is in circulation is high. Infunded rhACE2 was evaluated in clinical tests for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Applications about COVID-19 are mobile software applications to help monitoring in response to the 2019-2020 coronary virus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying people -contacts - who may have contacted infected individuals.
Countless applications have been developed or proposed, with official government support in some territories and jurisdictions.
Several structures to create contact monitoring applications have been developed.
Privacy issues were raised, especially on systems based on tracking the geographic location of the application users.
Less intrusive alternatives include the use of Bluetooth signals to record user proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate the functionality to support such Bluetooth-based applications directly to their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, together with Alipay, has implemented an app that allows citizens to check whether they have been in contact with a COVID-19 carrier.
It is in use in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is being used.
The application was developed by the local IT community, released as an open source and will be handed over to the government. The North Macedonia launched the \"StopKorona\", a Bluetooth-based app to track exposure to potentially infected people and provide a quick response to health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
Since April 14, 2020, the app has been waiting for approval by Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government declared that the contact tracking application was in advanced stage of development, and would be available for distribution in weeks. A similar application is planned for Ireland, and for France-StopCovid-.
Australia and New Zealand plan applications based on the TraceTogether application of Singapore and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to implement a geographic delimitation application for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Moscow, designed to ensure that they do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, listed a number of potential practical problems with application-based systems, including false positives and the potential lack of effectiveness if acceptance of the application is limited to only a small portion of the population.
In response to concerns about the dissemination of “coronavirus” applications, which are false or harmful, Apple sets limits for the types of organizations that can add coronaryvirus related applications to its App Store, limiting them only to “official” or otherwise respected organizations.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy defenders expressed concern about the implications of mass surveillance using coronavirus applications, especially as to whether the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be dismantled when the threat has passed.
The International Anistia and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement requesting limits for this type of surveillance.
The organizations have declared eight conditions for government projects:
surveillance should be “legal, necessary and proportionate”
extensions of monitoring and surveillance should have suspension clauses;
the use of data should be limited for the purposes of COVID-19;
the security and anonymity of the data should be protected and presented as protected on the basis of evidence;
digital surveillance should avoid the worsening of discrimination and marginalisation;
any data sharing with third parties should be provided for in law;
there should be safeguards against abuse and the rights of citizens to respond to abuses;
the significant participation of all relevant stakeholders would be required, including that of public health specialists and marginalized groups. The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) of Germany and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to deal with the persistent surveillance problem by removing the tracking mechanism from its operating device systems when it is no longer necessary.
Some countries have used network-based location tracking rather than applications, eliminating the need to download an application and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking has been approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to gross location data have considerable potential privacy problems.
However, not all systems with central servers need access to personal location data; a number of systems that preserve privacy have been created to use central servers only for intercom (see section below).
In South Korea, an application-based system was used to execute contact tracking.
Instead of using an exclusive application, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, combining them to generate text messages for potentially infected individuals.
In addition to using this information to alert potential interlocutors, the government has also made location information publicly available, which is allowed due to the comprehensive changes to the privacy laws of the information after the outbreak of MERS in the country.
This information is available to the public through a series of applications and sites. Countries, including Germany, consider using both the privacy preservation system and the centralized one.
By 6 April 2020 the details had not yet been disclosed.
The contact tracking preserving privacy is a well-defined concept, with a significant body of scientific bibliography reassessing at least, 2013. Since 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups have been working on solutions that respect privacy, with the use of Low Energy (BLE) Bluetooth to record the proximity of a user to other mobile devices.
However, the PEPP-PT is a coordinating effort that covers centralized and decentralized approaches, and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include Decentralized Privacy-Preservation Proximity Tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, fka Contact Event Numbers, CEN) Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracing (PACT) and others.
In these protocols, identifiable personal data never come out of the device, and any combination is made on the device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab has developed Safe Paths, a platform for the use of privacy preservation techniques during the collection and use of path location or crossing data to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on research from the technical publication-Applicatives play dirty: maintaining personal privacy in an epidemic - released in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform of the Enigma MPC, an effort that develops privacy technologies and originally founded in the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and those responsible without compromising the privacy of this data.
On 5 April 2020, the TCN Global Coalition was founded by groups that joined together around what was essentially the same approach and largely overlapping protocols, with the aim of reducing fragmentation, and allowing the overall interoperability of alert and tracking applications, a key aspect of the achievement of widespread adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the government of Singapore announced that the BlueTrace protocol, used by the government's official application, became open source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, companies that control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for contact tracking, in which they claimed that they would preserve privacy, based on a combination of low energy Bluetooth technology and encryption for privacy preservation.
They have also published specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system foresees implementation in three stages:
development of tools to enable the government to create official coronaryvirus tracking applications preserving privacy
integration of this feature directly into iOS and Android; Google and Apple plan to deal with persistent and assumed surveillance problems by first distributing the system for system updates in operation, and later removing it in the same way as the threat ends.
Drug repositioning (also known as drug reproposing, reperfiling, reassignment or therapeutic replacement) is the reproposal of a drug approved for the treatment of a medical condition or disease other than that for which it was originally developed.
This is one of the scientific research lines that are currently being adopted to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research directions include the development of a convalescent plasma transfusion and vaccine for COVID-19. SARS-COV-2 has about 66 drug-resistant proteins, each with multiple binding points.
Analyzing these binding points provides the reasonable development project of effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important target proteins in SARS-CoV-2 are the papaine-like protease, RNA-dependent polymerase, helicase, S protein and ADP ribophosphatease.
Hussein A. A., et al. studied several candidate compounds that later improved and analyzed for their structural similarities to the most similar approved drugs in order to accelerate the development of a potent drug against SARS-CoV-2 in its preclinical study to be recommended for a clinical study concept.
Chloroquina is a drug against malaria that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs studied as part of the clinical trial Solidarity.
The governor of New York Andrew Cuomo announced that the trials with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine from the state of New York would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate via an Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA).
Treatment was not approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorized through the EUA only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients who cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC said that (the use, dosage or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection) are not yet established.
Doctors said they're using the drug when - there's no other option -
In Istanbul, a Turkish research team is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Large studies are underway at Duke University and Oxford University.
The NYU School of Langone Medicine is conducting a test on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen have demonstrated that favipiravir has been - clearly effective -
In Shenzhen, 35 patients tested negative within 4 days on average, while the duration of the disease in the 45 patients who did not receive it was 11 days.
In a study conducted in Wuhan with 240 patients with pneumonia, half were treated with favipiravir, and half received umifenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Agency reminded the population that the existing evidence to underpin the medicine is scarce and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy Japan's medicine to store it and use the army to deliver it to university hospitals, where it would be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has created openings for Trump administration on the purchase of the medicine. The medicine can be less effective in serious cases of the disease when the virus has already multiplied.
Its use may not be safe for pregnant women or women trying to become pregnant.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir antivirals, concluded that -no benefit was observed -
The drugs were developed to inhibit the replication of HIV by binding to the protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drugs to find a compound that binds to the SARS-CoV-2 protease. There are criticisms in the scientific community about directing resources to reproduce drugs developed specifically for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the International Solidarity Trial.
The remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences discovered after remdesivir presented antiviral activity in vitro against phylum, pneumum, paramix and coronavirus.
One of the problems with antiviral treatment is the resistance developed by mutations, which can lead to more serious transmissions or diseases.
Some early pre-testing studies suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. There are several ongoing clinical trials, including two conducted by Cleveland University Hospitals, one for people with moderate disease and one for those with more serious disease.
There are three clinical trials with intravenous vitamin C occurring for hospitalized and severely ill patients with VOC-19: two of them are placebo-controlled (in China and Canada), while the other has no control group (Italy).
The state of New York began testing with azithromycin, an antibiotic, on 24 March 2020.
The National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) of Japan plans a clinical trial of the company Alvesco (cyclesonide), Teijin, which is an inhalable corticosteroid for asthma. The goal is the treatment of presymptomatic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
Phase II of a study with a type of angiotensin 2 converting enzyme is in progress with 200 patients, to be recruited between severe cases hospitalized in Denmark, Germany and Austria, to determine the efficacy of treatment.
Currently, researchers at the Heart Institute in Canada are researching the role of colchicine in reducing lung complications and inflammation in patients with mild symptoms of CVID-19.
The study, called COLCORONA, is recruiting 6,000 adults over the age of 40, diagnosed with COVID-19 and with mild symptoms, who did not need to be hospitalized.
Pregnant women who are breast-feeding or who do not use effective contraceptive methods were not included in the tests.
Several anticoagulants are tested in Italy.
Heparin, of low molecular weight, is being widely used in the treatment of patients, which led the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines on use.
A multicenter study, with 300 patients, is analyzing the use of sodium enoxaparin in prophylaxis and therapeutic dosages. The study was announced on April 14, Italy.
Because SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, the attention of the scientific community has been considerable in order to give new purpose to antiviral drugs approved and developed for the treatment of previous outbreaks, such as those of MERS, SARS and the West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Some antibiotics were identified as able to receive a new purpose for the treatment of patients with COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6 receptor): approved in China.
There are also tests in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
The vaccine for COVID-19 is a hypothetical vaccine against coronary virus disease of 2019 (COVID-19).
Although there is no vaccine with the completed clinical tests, there are several ongoing attempts to develop it.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said not to expect a vaccine against SARS-COV-2, a disease-causing virus, available in less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates were in phase I of the safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
There was a great spread of the outbreak in 2020, which led to considerable investments and research activities for the development of a vaccine.
Several organizations are using genomes published for the development of possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
The initiative of the Coalition of Innovations in Epidemic Preparation, CEPI, stated in April that the needs for the development of the vaccine are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale development and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported 10 different technology platforms being researched and under development during the beginning of 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The goals of the major platforms that have advanced for phase I safety studies include:
Nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Modern, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus type 5 vector)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the initial stages of development, with 78 of them confirmed as active projects (79 according to the Milken Institute). 37 others were announced, but with little information available to the public (considered in planning or being projected).
A phase I-II test performs the preliminary safety and immunogenicity test, typically randomized, placebo-controlled and multicenter, while determining more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III tests typically involve more participants in a control group. They test the effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing the disease while monitoring adverse effects on the ideal dose.
Of the 79 candidates for active development vaccine (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 have not yet had an evaluation in human beings (followed in preclinical research).
On January 24, 2020, in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it is investigating the potential of a vaccine with a molecular staple, which would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate an immune reaction.
On January 24, 2020, in Canada, the International Vaccines Center (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan, announces the start of work on a vaccine, with the aim of testing in human beings in 2021.
Vaccines development projects were announced at the Center for Disease Prevention and Control in China on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
On 29 January 2020, the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced the start of their work for the development of a vaccine.
Janssen is co-developing an oral vaccine with his biotech partner in Vaxart.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a document on the development of a vaccine with similar technology used for neo-antigen vaccination therapy.
On March 25 the head of the research institute announced that they had completed the synthesis of the vaccine and were starting the tests.
On February 27, 2020, a subsidiary company of Generex, NuGenerex Immununo-Oncology, announced that they were initiating a vaccine project to create a li-Key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a vaccine candidate that could be tested in humans - in the next 90 days -

in the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
The partners subsequently announced plans for the preclinical test and Phase I of clinical studies in July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that they are working with 11 isolates and, even at an accelerated step, it would take at least between one year and a half and two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in the city of Quebec, reported the development of a particle similar to Coronavirus under partial funding from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
The vaccine candidate is in research in the laboratory, with the human tests planned for July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian stated that the President of the United States, Donald Trump offered CureVac - large sums of money for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine - under protest from the German government.
On March 17, 2020, the pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to develop a mRNA-based vaccine together.
BNT162, a mRNA-based candidate vaccine, currently in preclinical testing, with clinical tests expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy on March 17, 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company announced that it would have preclinical testing results in April 2020 and its final vaccine candidate could leave for human testing in the fall.
In France, on March 19, 2020, the Coalition of Innovations in Epidemic Preparation (CEPI) announced an investment of $4.9 million in a research consortium for the vaccine for COVID-19 involving Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, leading the total investment of CEPI in the development of the vaccine for COVID-19 to $29 million.
The other investment partners of CEPI for the development of the vaccine for COVID-19 are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford, and the University of Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health authorities announced that scientists began testing on animals of six different vaccine candidates.
Imperial College researchers in London announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing a self-amplifying RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequencing of China.
At the end of March, the Canadian government announced C$275 million in funding for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including several vaccine candidates in Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and the initiatives of the University of Saskatchewan.
Almost in the same period, the Canadian government announced C$ 192 million specifically to develop the vaccine for COVID-19, with plans to establish a national vaccine bank of several new vaccines that could be used if other outbreaks of the Coronavirus occur.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported the test of PittCoVacc, a possible vaccine against COVID-19 in rats, stating that - The MNA delivered vaccines from SARS-COV-2 S1 subunit that elicited powerful responses from specific antibodies to antigens [in the mouse] that were evident that they started 2 weeks after immunization -
In Canada on April 16, 2020, the University of the Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced the development of a DNA-based vaccine candidate as possibly a nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be planned to replicate within a human bacteria to produce virus-like harmless particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry and three U.S. universities brought together resources to access IBM's supercomputers, in combination with computing in the cloud of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterological effects, also called non-specific effects.
That means they may have benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
A further randomized test in Australia is seeking to enroll 4,170 health workers.
Developing vaccines may not be safe or effective.
Initial research to evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine using specimens of animals specific to COVID-19, such as ACE2-transgenic mouse, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, indicates a need for containment measures for level 3 biosecurity to manipulate live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have already been tested in non-human animals.
In 2020, there is no cure or vaccine to protect against SARS that has proved safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medications to treat SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. There is also no proven vaccine against MERS.
When MERS became predominant, it was believed that the existing SARS research could provide a useful model for the development of vaccines and therapeutic treatment against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was a MERS vaccine (based on DNA) that concluded phase I of clinical studies in humans, and three other vaccines in progress, all of which are virus-vectorized vaccines, two with adenoviral vector (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one vectorized by MVA (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media publications promoted a conspiracy theory claiming that the virus behind COVID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
Patents cited by several social media publications indicate existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other Coronavirus strains such as the SARS Coronavirus.
The disease by Betacoronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a severe acute Coronavirus 2 respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, throat pain, loss of smell and abdominal pain.
The time of exposure to the onset of symptoms is about 5 days, but may vary from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases result in mild symptoms, some develop to a viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases had been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153 thousand deaths.
More than 568,000 people have already been cured. The virus is spread among people mainly during direct contact, usually through droplets produced by cough, sneezing or speech.
Although these droplets are produced when expiring, they usually fall on the ground or remain on surfaces rather than remain infectious in long distances.
People can also get infected by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is more contagious during the first 3 days after the onset of symptoms, although dissemination may be possible before the symptoms appear and in subsequent stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is by reaction in the chain of the reverse transcription polymerase in real time (rRT-PCR) of a nasopharyngeal swap.
The use of masks is recommended for people suspected of the virus and for people responsible for their care.
Recommendations for the use of masks by the general population vary, where some authorities recommend non-use, some recommend use and others force use.
Currently, there is no specific antiviral vaccine or treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease was recorded in most countries across all six WHO regions.
Virus infected may be asymptomatic or develop flu-like symptoms, cough, fatigue, and difficulty breathing.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty staying awake, face or lips blue.
Less common, symptoms of the upper respiratory tract such as sneezing, sliding nose, or throat pain can be seen.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea were observed in different percentages.
Some cases in China initially presented only chest tightness and palpitations.
In some, the disease can evolve into pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death.
This is the so-called incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually six days, but may range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms will develop them within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that not all infected will develop symptoms.
The function these asymptomatics perform in transmission is not yet fully known; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people who do not have symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied, and the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during their hospital stay.
China's National Health Commission began to include asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on 1 April; of the 166 infections that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
The sputum and saliva can carry large viral loads.
Talking loud releases more droplets than speaking normally.
A study in Singapore found that coughing without covering the mouth can cause droplets to reach 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not usually transported through the air, the National Academy of Science suggested that bioaerosol transmission can be possible and air collectors positioned in corridors outside the rooms of people contained positive samples for a viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as cardiopulmonary intubation and resuscitation (CPR), can generate respiratory secretions that will be aerosolized and therefore transmitted by air.
Although there is concern that it can be transmitted through feces, if it believes that the risk is low. The virus is more contagious when people are symptomatic. Although there is possible transmission before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that although it is not entirely clear how easy the disease is to spread, usually one or two people are infected. The virus survives for hours or days on the surface.
Specifically, it was found that the virus was detectable for one day in cardboard, up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and up to four hours in 99% copper.
This, however, depends on humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergent are also effective if used properly. Products with soap degrade the protective lipid envelope of the virus, disabling it, as well as removing it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzoalcônium chloride and chlorhexidine glyconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective. In a study conducted in Hong Kong, saliva samples were collected on average two days after the initiation of hospitalization.
In five of the six patients, the first sample presented the highest viral load, while the sixth patient presented the highest viral load on the second day tested.
Coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2) is a new acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus that was first isolated in three people with pneumonia who were related to a group of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
All characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in nature, in related coronaviruses.
Outside the human body, the virus dies in contact with domestic soap, which breaks its protective layer. SARS-COV-2 is closely linked to the original SARS-COV.
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses host cells through the converting enzyme of angiotensin 2 (ACE2), which is most abundant in the type II alveolar cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a \"spicle\" (peplomer) to connect to the ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute heart injury was observed in 12% of the infected people who were hospitalized in Wuhan, China, and is more frequent in severe disease.
The rate of cardiovascular symptoms is high thanks to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease evolution, but acute myocardial injury may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in cardiac function.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was found in ICU patients with CVID-19 infections and may be related to the poor prognosis. Necropsies of people who died due to VOC-19 showed diffuse alveolar damage (ADD) and inflammatory infiltrates containing lymphocytes in the lung.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has tropism for respiratory tract epithelial cells that express ACE2, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammatory.
In particular, it has been demonstrated that pathogenic T cells that secrete GM-CSF have a correlation with the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes secretors of IL-6 and severe lung pathology in patients with COVID-19.
Lymphocytic infiltrates were also reported in the necropsy.
WHO has published several test protocols for the disease.
The standard test method is the polymerase chain reaction via reverse transcription in real time (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually done in respiratory samples obtained through a nasopharyngeal swap, however, a nasal swap or catarrh sample may be used.
The results are usually available in a few hours up to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but for this it is necessary to collect two blood samples with two weeks of difference and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a coronary virus strain and publish its genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction tests (PCR) to detect virus infection.
As of 4 April 2020, tests using antibodies (which can detect active infections and if a person was infected in the past) were under development, but have not yet been widely used.
The experience of the Chinese with testing showed that its accuracy is 60 to 70%.
The FDA of the United States approved the first remote laboratory test on 21 March 2020 for use at the end of that month. The diagnostic guidelines released by the Zhongnan Hospital at Wuhan University suggest methods for detecting infections based on clinical resources and epidemiological risk.
Opacity in bilateral multilobar dark glass with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution are common at the beginning of infection.
Subpleural dominance, mosaic paving (septs thick with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation may appear as the disease progresses.
There are few data available on microscopic lesions and physiopathology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings during autopsies are:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary oedema
Four types of viral pneumonia severity can be observed:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, atypical large pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and formation of multinucleated giant cells
Severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (ADD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) and severe hypoxia.
treated pneumonia: organization of exudates in alveolar cavities and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (CID); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home, avoiding places with many people, frequently washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching the eyes, nose and mouth with hands without washing.
The CDC recommends that the mouth and nose be covered with a tissue when coughing or sneezing, as well as cover the mouth with the inner side of the elbow if the scarf is not available.
Proper hand hygiene after coughing or sneezing is encouraged.
The CDC recommended the use of cloth masks in public places, in part to limit transmission by asymptomatic individuals. Social distance strategies aim to reduce contact of people infected with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and canceling large public meetings.
Distanceing guidelines also include people staying at least 1.8 feet (6 feet) away from each other.
An effective medicine for the prevention of COVID-19 is not known. Since the vaccine should not be launched before 2021, a key point for the control of COVID-19 is to try to decrease the peak of the epidemic, also known as ‘purchasing the curve’.
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands frequently using soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when their hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing.
It also recommends using antiseptics for alcohol-based hands with at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not readily available. For places where commercial antiseptics are not readily available, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, antimicrobial activity occurs through ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; it is not - an active substance for hand aseptics -
Glycerol is added as humidifier.
People are treated through palliative care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support and support for other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that people who suspect that they are with the virus use a simple facial mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was used to treat the respiratory failure problem, but its benefits are still under analysis.
Personal hygiene and lifestyle and healthy diet are being recommended to improve immunity.
Support treatments can be useful for those with mild symptoms and early stages of infection. WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for the care of people hospitalized with COVID-19.
Intensive physicians and pneumologists from the U.S. gathered recommendations for treatment of several agencies in a free resource, the IBCC.
By April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some health professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen for first-line use.
Caution should be taken to minimize the risks of transmission of the virus, especially in the health environment, when procedures are being carried out that can generate aerosols, such as intubation and manual ventilation.
For health professionals taking care of people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in rooms with isolation of airborne infections (SIIA) in addition to taking standard precautions, contact precautions and air precautions. The CDC summarizes the guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is: PPE blanket, breather or facial mask, visual protection and medical gloves. When available, it is preferable to use respirators instead of facial masks.
Respirators N95 are approved for industrial environments, but the FDA authorized masks for use under Emergency Use Authority (ESU).
They were designed to protect against air particles as dust, but their effectiveness against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed for undescribed uses.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of facial shields or, as a last resort, home masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or alternatives, but a percentage of cases are.
The type of respiratory support for individuals with COVID-19-related respiratory failure is being studied for people in hospitals, with some evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high flow nasal cannula or positive pressure on the airways at two levels.
If either of these leads to the same benefits for people who are seriously ill, it is not known.
Some doctors prefer to keep invasive mechanical ventilation when it is available because this technique limits aerosol particles to spread, compared to high-flowing nasal cannula. Severe cases are more common in the elderly (those over 60 years and especially over 80 years).
Many developing countries do not have sufficient per capita hospital beds, which limits the health system's ability to deal with sudden escalation in the number of cases of COVID-19 severe enough to require hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of the people in the hospital with COVID-19 were eventually taken to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex as acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) develops in COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes increasingly difficult.
Fans that have pressure control mode and high level PEEP are needed to increase the delivery of oxygen while minimizing the risk of lung lesions and pneumothorax associated with ventilation.
High PEEP level may not be available in older fans.
The research for potential treatments began in January 2020 and clinical tests are being conducted with various antiviral drugs.
The Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new medicines may take up to 2021 to be developed, several of the tested drugs have already been approved for other uses or are in advanced testing phase.
Antiviral medicine can be tested in people with various diseases.
WHO recommended that volunteers participate in the efficacy and safety tests of potential treatments. The FDA gave temporary authorization for plasma use of convalescent people as treatment in cases where the person's life is serious and immediately threatened.
The clinical studies required to show their safety and effectiveness against the disease have not yet been performed.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the outbreak of the disease.
It is requested that users inform their name and ID number.
The application can detect the “near-contact” using monitoring data and thus the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the application not only recommends quarantine but also alerts local health authorities. Big data analysis of cell phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are being used to track infected people and the people they have contacted in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Government of Israel authorized security agencies to track mobile phone data of people who are supposed to have kronaviruses.
The measure was taken to strengthen quarantine and protect people who can contact infected citizens.
Still in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregate telephone location data with the German federal government agency Robert Koch Institute to research and prevent the transmission of the virus.
Russia has implemented facial recognition technology to detect those who neglect quarantine.
The Italian regional health commissioner, Giulio Gallera, said he was informed by cellular operators that -40% of the people continue to circulate anyway -
The German government led a 48-hour hackaton on the weekend with over 42,000 participants.
In addition, the president of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global appeal for creative solutions against the spread of the coronavirus.
Individuals may experience quarantine difficulties, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of infection itself.
BBC quoted Rory O'Connor, who said: \"The increase in social isolation, loneliness, medical anxiety, stress and an economic crisis are a perfect storm to harm people's mental health and well-being\"
The disease may have a mild evolution, with few or no symptoms, resembling other common diseases of the upper respiratory tract, such as cold.
Mild cases usually recover within two weeks, while those with severe or critical disease may take from three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may have a higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection, according to data from other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but data from COVID-19 are missing. In some people, COVID-19 may affect the lungs, causing pneumonia.
In those most seriously affected, COVID-19 can progress rapidly to adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), causing respiratory failure, septic shock or multiple organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, coagulation disorders and heart, kidney, and liver damage.
Coagulation disorders, specifically the increase in prothrombin time, were described in 6% of hospital admissions with COVID-19, while renal failure was seen in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20-30% of people with CVID-19 have elevated liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the median between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five days of hospitalization.
However, patients transferred to an ICU had a median of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In a study with early cases, the median manifestation of the initial symptoms until death was 14 days, with a total interval of six to 41 days.
In a study by China's National Health Commission (NHC), men had a 2.8% mortality rate, while women had a 1.7% mortality rate.
Histopathological examinations of post-pulmonary death samples show diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromixoid exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in the pneumocytes.
The imaging examination of the lung appeared to be acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of the deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, heart damage was detected due to elevated levels of troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to U.S. March data, 89% of the hospitalized had pre-existing comorbidities. The availability of medical resources and socioeconomic factors in a region may also affect mortality.
Comorbidity mortality estimates vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
The underreporting of mild cases can cause the mortality rate to be overestimated.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of cases contracted in the past can mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to have serious symptoms of CVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely to require intensive treatment or die, compared to non-smokers. Concerns about disease sequelae in the long term were raised.
The hospital authority in Hong Kong verified a fall of 20% to 30% in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and lung tests indicated damage to the organ.
This can also lead to intensive post-care syndrome after recovery.
Until March 2020, it was not known whether past infections would give effective and lasting immunity to people who recovered from the disease.
Immunity is seen as probable, based on the behavior of other coronoviruses, but cases have been reported where the recovery of COVID-19 was followed by positive tests for coronavirus at a later date.
These cases are believed to be the worst of a prolonged infection rather than a reinfection.
It is believed that the virus is natural and has animal origin, by means of transhipment infection.
The actual origin is unknown, but as of December 2019, the spread of the infection became almost entirely driven by the transmission of humans to humans.
A study with the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed that the earliest date of symptoms onset was 1 December 2019.
Official WHO publications reported the earliest date of symptoms such as December 8, 2019.
Several measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary by region and with time and are influenced by the volume of tests, quality of the health system, treatment options, time elapsed since the initial outbreak and population characteristics such as age, gender and health in general.
At the end of 2019, WHO attributed the ICD-10 emergency disease codes U07.1 for deaths resulting from SARS-COV-2 infection confirmed in laboratory and U07.2 for deaths by COVID-19 with clinical or epidemiological diagnosis, without SARS-COV-2 infection confirmed in laboratory. The mortality rate reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a given time interval.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the overall lethality rate was 6.9% (153,822/2.240.191) on 17 April 2020.
The number varies by region. Other measures include the lethality rate for cases (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed individuals who die from an illness, and the mortality rate for infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected individuals (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a disease.
These statistics are not restricted to time and accompany a specific population from infection to resolution of the case.
Although not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information on how many people have been infected.
At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600, 80 (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease was propagated by Carnival festivals and spread among younger people, causing a relatively lower mortality, and not all deaths by COVID-19 should have been formally registered as such.
In addition, the German health system was not overloaded.
In the Netherlands, about 3% may have antibodies, as found in blood donors.
69 (0.004% of the population) had the confirmed death by COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality rate are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher in men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The greatest risk for men is in the 50-year range, with the difference between men and women only approaching 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact reasons for the gender difference are not known, but genetic and behavioral factors may be the reason.
Immunological differences due to gender, lower prevalence of smoking women and the development by men of comorbidities as hypertension at a lower age than women may have contributed to higher mortality among men.
In Europe, 57% of the infected individuals were men, and 72% of those killed by COVID-19 were men.
By April 2020, the U.S. government was not tracking data on sex-related COVID-19 infections.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women in different ways.
A higher percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and they are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease was ‘COVID-19’
WHO's head, Tedros Adhanon Ghebreyesus, explained that “CO” is of “corona” (“VI”) of “virus” disease and “D” is from when the outbreak was identified: December 31, 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographic location (e.g. China), animal species or group of people, in accordance with the international nomenclature recommendations to prevent stigmatizations. The virus that causes COVID-19 was called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2).
WHO also uses the COVID-19 virus and the COVID-19 virus in communications to the public.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly called \"coronaviruses\"
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as “Coronavirus” and “Wuhan Coronavirus”
In January 2020, WHO recommended “2019-nCov” and “acute respiratory disease by 2019-nCOV” as an interim name for the virus and disease, according to the 2015 orientation against the use of sites in disease and virus names.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-COV-2 were published on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing health material, such as nasopharyngeal parrots and respiratory parts.
In one example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a breather valve, and the supplier was unable to deliver on the necessary schedule, a local startup did reverse engineering and printed the 100 valves needed from one day to the other.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and misinformation arose about the origin, dimension, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease, which quickly spread over the Internet.
Apparently, humans are able to transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No medicine or vaccine has been approved for the treatment of the disease.
International research on vaccines and drugs for COVID-19 is underway in government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization initiated the \"SOLIDARITY Trial\" to evaluate the effects of treatment with four existing antiviral components with more likely efficacy.
There is no vaccine available, but several agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous studies on SARS-COV are being used because both SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2 use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategies being investigated.
First, researchers aim to develop a vaccine with the integral virus.
The use of this virus, whether inactive or dead, aims to cause a rapid immune response of the human body to a new infection of COVID-19.
A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on the spin protein that helps the virus to enter the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
A third strategy is that of nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique for creating vaccines).
Experimental vaccines of any of these strategies should have the safety and efficacy tested. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical test of a vaccine started with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains an harmless genetic code copied from the virus causing the disease. The antibody-dependent improvement was pointed out as a possible challenge for the development of a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, but this is controversial.
More than 300 clinical trials have been in progress since April 2020.
Seven tests evaluated treatments already approved for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The redirection of antiviral drugs consists of most of the Chinese research, with nine clinical tests in phase III of rendezvous in several countries due to a report of the end of April.
A dynamic analysis of the clinical development of medicine and vaccine candidates for COVID-19 was ongoing in April 2020. Several existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, including remedy, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir combined with interferon beta.
There is an attempt to prove the effectiveness of the re-drawing since March 2020.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with remedisiveness for compassionate use.
Phase III clinical tests are being performed in the USA, China and Italy. Chloroquina, already used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, there are requests for a peer review of the research.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Virology Institute, although recommends a daily dose of one gram, warns that twice this dose is highly dangerous and can be lethal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA published an emergency authorisation for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine on the basis of doctors who treat people with COVID-19. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir for use against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are required to inhibit SARS-COV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended for further study in vivo after having demonstrated low inhibitory concentration of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that the initial spicule protein in preparation for the transmembrane serum 2 protease (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Studies on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major limitations that prevented the medical community from adopting these therapies without further studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known function in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytocin storm can be a complication in the later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have cytokine anti-tempest properties. Tocilzumab was included in the treatment guidelines by the National Health Commission of China after the conclusion of a small study.
A non-randomised test is under way at phase 2 of national level in Italy, after having shown positive results in people with severe disease.
Combined with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokine storms, it is expected to neutralize these developments, which are considered the cause of the death of some affected people.
The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA based on retrospective case studies on the treatment of cytokines release syndrome refractory to steroids induced by a different cause, CAR T cell therapy, in 2017.
So far, there is no controlled and randomized evidence that tocilzumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system of those who recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them is being investigated as a non-vaccinating passive immune method.
This strategy was tested for SARS, with inconclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the mechanism of action expected by which passive antibody therapy can mediate a defense against SARS-CoV-2.
Other mechanisms, however, such as antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are in development.
Convalescent serum production, which consists of the liquid portion of the blood of recovered patients and contains specific antibodies to this virus, could be increased for faster implementation.
Coronavirus disorders, a group of strongly related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, later contracted and died of COVID-19 after he became aware of the spread of the virus.
