Barack Obama will be the fourth American President to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
U.S. President Barack Obama will arrive in Oslo, Norway to spend 26 hours and receive the Nobel Peace Prize, as the fourth American President of history.
The diploma, medal and cheque of $1.4 million will receive them, inter alia, for their exceptional efforts in strengthening world diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will arrive at the Norwegian metropolis in the morning and they will have much to do.
First, visit of the Nobel Institute, where for the first time he will meet with the five members of the committee who, in October, elected him between 172 people and 33 organizations.
Later, the presidential couple has a meeting with the king of Norway, Harald V, and Queen Sonia.
In the afternoon the visit will culminate in a ceremony in which Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth U.S. president to receive him, even if the third one who receives him in his office.
The White House has already announced that, upon receiving the award, it will talk about the Afghan war.
The President does not want to avoid this issue, knowing that he is receiving the prize as President of a country currently at war in two countries.
His war efforts increased further with the sending of additional troops to Afghanistan, not forgetting to mention any of his critics.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive the gold medal, the diploma and cheque of ten million Swedish crowns (approximately 24 million Czech crowns).
It is proposed to give them charitable paraffins, but it has not yet decided which organization in particular.
During his full programme, the President and his wife will participate in a banquet to which they will come, in addition to the Norwegian kings, the Prime Minister and 250 other guests.
Obama from the beginning had a rather reserved attitude toward the prize.
He mentioned, for example, having the feeling that he did not deserve it at all.
He also repeated several times that the prize is not just for him, but for all who struggle for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement he mentioned that it represents - a challenge to take action -
Defendant of nature accused of blackmail
Litoměřice police accused the president of the civic association Společnost ochrancŭ přírody Litoměřice (Society of defenders of the nature Litoměřice).
Last year he appealed several times against certain procedures for granting building licenses and to withdraw the appeals demanded money from investors for his own benefit, said Litoměřice Alena Romová police spokesman.
The president of the Society defensores de la nature Litoměřice is Lubomír Studnička.
He is currently under arrest and is facing a sentence of up to three years in prison.
Brno doesn't like the containers too much to separate the garbage.
In Prague, citizens can separate the packaging of drinks and in the villages of southern Moravia can find containers to separate garbage on all sides.
And Brno?
It takes several minutes to find the respective containers.
I don't want to say that Brno doesn't split up for nothing.
It seems to me that, in order to be the second largest city in the Republic, the municipalities are not interested enough in this problem.
Brno is totally behind in the separation of garbage, not only because we, the citizens, can only use containers to separate paper, glass and plastic, but above all by the number of containers for such waste.
Have you ever tried, for example, to throw a bottle of PET into the center at the proper container?
It is almost impossible, especially it takes a lot of time and patience.
The only place I have found so far is in Moravské náměstí square, in front of Potrefená Huse.
Don't be angry with me, Mr. Onderka and his companions, but that seems too little to me.
It should not be mentioned that elsewhere it is not easy to separate the trash.
That's why many of my friends prefer not to separate her.
By Wandering
What happens is that the containers are far away.
I'm not surprised.
I myself offered to throw several bottles of glass and plastic into the trash after a party.
But in the Street Kaunicova I didn't see any red containers nearby.
Fortunately, on my way to the tram I found the right place.
However, the garbage was already soaking from the container.
It's still the center of Brno, the most representative part of the city, isn't it?!
What is happening is that ecology and aesthetics do not seem to be too interested in Brno's socialists.
They prefer to buy the extra league of hockey from the city, which embarrasss us throughout the republic, and does not buy more containers or offer the separation of other materials so that Brno is cleaner.
I'm glad I can compare my hypothesis, after surfing the Internet a little, with official statistics.
According to EKO-KOM society, Brno is truly the worst in the entire region Jihomoravský kraj.
The budget for Paroubek removed money from income and sickness benefits
After the left, despite the government's opinion, may add funds for farmers or officials, there may not be enough money in the budget for income, sickness subsidies or for construction savings.
But not for the interests of state debt or international litigation.
This will harm all those who rule in the second half of the coming year, says the Minister of Finance Eduard Janota.
When social democrats and communists imposed the increase for some groups, they relied that the government would post-request for a loan for sensitive expenses, incomes or sickness subsidies. \"This only means deferring the problems for the future, it is to place mines,\" says Janota.
What happens is that, when money is borrowed, you have to pay higher and higher interest and, someday, you have to return the money.
The state does not have many options to get money.
If it does not reduce social benefits or State operating costs, tax must be increased.
To all who added the left now: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And later, also your children.
People don't have to worry about rents or sickness subsidies, they'll get them. From these accounts 1,8 billion disappeared.
But the price to be paid will be the increase in public debt; the coming year will not be missing in the treasure just 163,000 million, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, debt will continue to increase along with interest costs.
The State will need money to cover them and will no longer come with a slight increase in VAT or a reduction in maternity benefits, as the government has done in its deficit package.
Due to the dislocations of money for the benefit of some groups of electors, next year there will also be five billion left to complete the construction of highways and railways.
These are, above all, the sectors in which the tender has already been concluded and where the construction process has already begun, whose projects cannot be changed and their price cannot be reduced.
The best you can do is keep them, which is not free either.
That means delay or cessation of the thirty major constructions; the possibility of obtaining European funds is also in danger, warns the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
ČSSD proposed a Solomonic solution for the reduction of funds: it will obtain money from the dividends of ČEZ, which is mostly State property, and will add the transport fund.
The problem is that the value of the dividend is never safe nor is it a bottomless bag.
Last year ČEZ allocated 18,000 million to the budget.
Each year of dividends are liquidated ecological damage, used to complete the income account or serve as a reserve for the planned income reform.
In addition, this trick, according to EU rules, increases the real budget deficit at the level of 5.7% of GDP.
The carnival of money transfers doesn't end here.
Nearly three billion were obtained from the budget to provide compensation to victims of communism and crimes, or for litigation, including in construction savings.
It is not clear whether the State will need such funds.
It's a lottery.
If we lose any international litigation, we may have to pay for it, says Janota.
Thereafter, the Minister will have to save money within the resort or, in the worst case, take care of the government budget reserve.
There are also a hundred million missing for the Statní pokladna (State Fund) project, which is two billion price and has already been started. It should allow you to monitor online what the various authorities are spending on.
The first stage begins in January.
If the finance minister does not find the money elsewhere, the project will have to stop and there will be sanctions, Janota warns.
Your future smartphone will be able to operate with two operating systems
Americans will have a mobile phone where the user can, by pressing a key, switch between several operating systems.
The revealed plans sound promising.
With just pressing a key, they move in a few seconds from Windows Mobile to Android.
Precisely this possibility is the goal of the U.S. VMware company, which focuses mainly on the development of virtualizing software for computers.
In your mobile you can take two user profiles at once.
They can change between them and divide them between home and work.
Both operate at the same time, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of the VMware company in the interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and several days ago it was first demonstrated.
It will be launched in 2012.
The virtualization of smartphones is no longer a fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated to journalists how the smartphone works with two operating systems.
It was the Nokia N800, modified with a 128 MB RAM, where the above-mentioned systems, Windows Mobile and Android, work at the same time.
The development of the new mobile phone technology is at its peak.
The VMware company cooperates with European and U.S. operators to test smartphone virtualization and these phones will reach customers during 2012.
The lack of snow in the mountains worries hoteliers
Not only do teleskiers in Krkonoše worry about snow-free slopes.
The lack of snow makes people not reserve skiing in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, in Krkonoše you can still get free rooms for all winter dates, including for Nochebuena and Nochevieja.
We have many visitors on our pages.
People look at the offers, check the prices, but they're still afraid to book with commitment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask about our opinion, if these Christmass will have snow or clay, - mentioned the maintainer of the Spindl information portal.Info Martin Jandura.
Those who want to pass in Špindlerćv Mlýn a Night Eve according to their expectations, should no longer hesitate to book the stay.
Those who prefer to save money and put the quality of accommodation second, can try to wait a few more days.
The Špindlerćv Mlýn hoteliers offer mostly weekly stays for Nochevieja.
I think they will continue to offer them, but they will soon give in and offer shorter stays.
And then the free rooms will be sold quickly, estimated Jandura.
Ingotours, a Vrchlabí travel agency, continues to offer free beds for all winter dates.
Now what interests us the most is the Christmas week, which is not yet complete.
Half of the places offered remain free.
That's why we've already prepared some last-minute Christmas stays, - the director of Ingtours Petr Schiefert mentioned.
Vrchlabí's travel agency can still offer nightlife in Krkonoše, but there are fewer free places.
The first 14 days of February are also sold very well, the remaining winter dates are sold regularly.
This year the interest in winter stays is damaged by the lack of snow in Krkonoše.
People are waiting to see if there's snow.
No one wants to spend the end of the year on the snowless mountain.
If the tracks remain snowy during the week, the Christmas dates will also be exhausted, - opina Schiefert.
On the contrary, it is a little easier to occupy the rooms at the Horizon hotel in Pec pod Sněžkou; last year it was harder.
We're about five percent better.
For Christmas and Christmas, we have the last free places.
Interest increases during Polish holidays in January and February is also sold well, - reported the director of the best hotel in Pec, Karel Rada.
Eighty percent of the stays in Nochevieja are already occupied also at the Omnia hotel, near the central parking lot in Janské Lázně.
On the contrary, in Janské Lázně's most recent hotel in Christmas, half of the beds are still free.
This January was a great surprise for us, as we are about sixty percent of the capacity to occupy.
February has been a bit weaker, but as soon as snow falls, interest in the stays in Krkonoše will surely increase, mentioned Erik Sporysch, the director of the hotel Omnia.
At the moment, however, it seems that Krkonoše's hoteliers will be passing their thirst for snow waiting.
On Thursday the temperatures must fall and, if there are precipitation, in the mountains it should snow.
But then the temperatures will rise again, reported Jiří Jakubský of Hradec Kralové, of the Hydrometeorological Institute of the Czech Republic.
U.S.: The repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is funny that Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of the smartest man, as a diligent student repeats in the Afghan question the strategy of his predecessor, whom he himself took for the foolishst.
When he finally revealed his Afghan approach, eagerly expected, it was shown to be a copy of the script used for Iraq by Bush, created three years ago.
Not only in the same text is the speech - the same as in Iraq - used several times, but it did not hesitate to use the title of the Bush statement of January 2007 for its own statement: -A new way forward -
He was himself, who three years ago criticized Bush's idea of sending new military reinforcements to Iraq, the country that is suffering from the civil war, and that criticized him as - an irresponsible decision with catastrophic consequences -
The following months, however, showed that Bush's strategy, based on the recommendations of field captains, was the only possible and successful one, so that today there is no mention of Iraq in the news.
Bush's reputation did not improve, however he objectively left his successor a situation that was much more favorable than expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes the miracle will be repeated.
The camp captains again asked him to increase the military contingent, especially the commander-in-chief of the Afghan General operation Stanley McCristal. He, even in spite of traditional subordinate relations, subjected the undecided gunmen in the White House to harsh criticism.
He asked 40,000 men to be able to improve the situation.
The president hesitated for three months, but nothing better happened to him, so at least he tricked the general over 10,000 military.
He managed to get Europe to promise another 5,000, even though he had at least 10,000 previously.
The most problematic of Obama's entire strategy seems to be his goal, to start withdrawing the troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and finalizing this procedure in three years. Obama's whole doctrine generated more questions from the answers he offered.
Many doubt that the increase bears the same fruit as the procedure in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars in recent years, Iraq's society is relatively well organized, its leaders respect the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is different: no one can be trusted and no agreement is reached.
Under these conditions it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, if they are used to changing the boss every day according to their needs.
Political institutions, although formally established, will remain only a people of Potemkin, after which patriarchal tribal relations will remain.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extraordinarily complicated due to confusing relations, even more complicated by the Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Not even establishing a state that is - capable of action - a minimum objective of the entire operation, seems very real.
Obama's strategy horizon is shocked by his voluntarism.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has continued to worsen and is now about to explode.
Only a romantic soul, who knows nothing about reality, can believe that the military sent to the war so that - they return home soon - will do some miracle here.
From the political point of view, setting the date of withdrawal of troops is pure irresponsibility, since the Taliban will consider it an indirect declaration of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that Europeans are increasingly less willing to participate in military operations in Afghanistan.
European politicians do not know, nor do they want to explain to their constituents, how much the security of Germany or Italy has to do with the war with Hindu Kush.
The other factor, capable of radically affecting the situation, is the development of the events in Iran.
If the situation continues to worsen and increased sanctions have no effect on Iranians, the US will have to make a difficult decision: try to solve the problem with military force or not.
It will be necessary to look for the answers precisely when, according to Obama, America begins the triumphal withdrawal of the troops from Afghanistan.
However, each solution will mean a dramatic setback for the Afghan situation.
The only positive point for Barack Obama is the fact that the presidential elections are three years away and that is why there is still a long time left to find another strategy, if this is a total failure.
Goldman Sachs bank managers will no longer receive cash bonuses
The senior executives of the U.S. bank Goldman Sachs will not receive cash bonuses this year.
The entity announced that it would react to the harsh criticism of its pay practices.
The group of 30 senior managers will receive, instead of money, shares that cannot be sold within a minimum period of five years.
In addition, actions may be withdrawn if they have taken excessive risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs thus became the leader in the effort to link bonuses on Wall Street with long-term power.
I suppose Wall Street is fully aware of the longer way it should take, mentioned the former investment bank of the entity JPMorgan Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in detail, he added.
The Goldman Sachs bank faced criticism with almost $17,000 million (nearly CZK 30 billion) for bonuses in the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of bonuses in the entity for this year, according to Reuters agency, is likely to exceed, despite the measure announced today, the $2 billion.
The high bonuses in the banking sector became, with the arrival of the financial crisis, a sensitive issue in politics.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it plans to charge at once, with a tax of 50 percent, the bank bonuses that exceed 25,000 pounds (approximately 712,000 CZK) .
France is also preparing similar measures.
This year women received the Nobel Prizes in all the less Physical categories
Five women, which is a record figure, received in Stockholm today by King Charles XVI Gustavo of Sweden the Nobel Prizes of this year, in specialized categories and in literature.
In addition to the four scientists, she was among the award-winning also a Romanian German writer, Herta Müller.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine received him from two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, as well as his compatriot Jack Szostak for research in the field of chromosomes.
The Nobel Prize in Chemistry received it by Israeli Ada Jonah and the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishna and Thomas Steitz for the explanation of the structure and function of the ribosomes.
The latest award, the Nobel Prize in Economics, was received by the American Elinor Ostrom and his compatriot Oliver Williamson for the analysis of an economic report.
The only specialized category, without a prized woman, was Physics.
This award was received today by scientists Charles Kao for research in the field of optical cables, and George Smith with Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or telescopes.
Each awardee collected the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of the money received.
This sum in each category is up to 10 million Swedish crowns (approximately 25 million Czech crowns).
In the case of several awards in each category, the prize is distributed to each other.
The traditionally most anticipated Nobel Peace President received him in the afternoon in Oslo, Norway, U.S. President Barack Obama.
In his speech he recognized the dispute that he had been awarded, as he was at the beginning of his career and was also at the head of a country participating in two wars: Iraq and Afghanistan.
In order to defend its policy, however, it added that in certain situations wars are essential to achieve peace, even if their price is high.
Minister Janota considers resignation. Klaus invited him to Castillo
President Václav Klaus will receive on Friday morning the finance minister Eduard Janota, who is raising his stay in the government, as he does not agree with the state budget version for the coming year, approved on Wednesday by the Chamber of Deputies.
The budget, and perhaps also the stay of Janota in the cabinet, is supposed to be the themes of his Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which continues to deepen the public finance crisis.
On the quote, President Radim Ochvat spokesperson reported.
On his stay in office, Janota wants to negotiate Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the Budget Act, prepared to be signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should govern with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The Chamber of Deputies, however, adopted the left-wing proposals on Wednesday for money transfers and raised money for the salaries of officials, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government disagrees with the social democrats' proposals, as covertly increases the budget deficit.
Between the left and the government, Klaus and the right on the one hand, there was a serious conflict of internal policy. Due to this conflict, the future activities of Fischer's bureaucratic cabinet begin to be controversial, the form of which was agreed in spring by the ODS, ČSSD and the Greens Party.
Critics claim that the budget, in the version approved by the House of Deputies, actually liquidates the savings package, imposed in the autumn by Fischer's government to curb public indebtedness.
Klaus may but he does not have to sign the state budget law; today he declared during a breakfast with employers that politicians had been disabling - the serious problem - that is, - the non-sustainable deficit - of public finances.
According to him today, they no longer have a good solution.
Only a strong government, which can be supported in a broader consensus among political parties, could improve this situation, the president believes.
The leader of ODS Mirek Topolánek mentioned, that the budget is appalling and that the government should think about its future existence.
The vice president of ODS, Petr Nečas, told ČTK that the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Greens evidently no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer reacted and described similar words of - strong feelings -
The head of ČSSD, Jiří Paroubek, reacted to Topolánek saying that the budget deficit is appalling, prepared for this year by the former government of Topolánek. It will exceed the 200,000 million crowns.
On Wednesday ČSSD said that the approval of the state budget for the coming year was successful.
People were also happy.
Mandela in the new Clint Eastwood film, played by Morgan Freeman
South Africans claim that Hollywood’s new film, Invictus: Invincible, tells a lot about the country, its struggle and its victories, although some criticisms say that the leading roles are performed by American actors.
History speaks of sport, racial relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist regime of apartheid in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is interpreted in his biography by the American actor winning an Oscar, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that Mandela, 91, asked him to play it in the Eastwood film.
Another important role will be played by Matt Damon.
I said, \"When I interpret it, I'll have to have access to you.
The actor of seventy-two years, who received the award for his role in the Eastwood drama about the world of boxing Million Dollar Baby, played the role of the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, which ended up being slave, of the fictional president of the United States, and even of God in Evan Almighty. But he rarely represented someone who still lives and, for many people, is as important as Mandela.
The former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for his activities to end apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and became President of the country for four years.
In 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus - Invincible is a Latin word and the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film is a real story about Nelson Mandela, who joined his forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to help unite the country. Mandela, the new president, knows that after apartheid his nation remains racially and economically divided.
He believes he is able to join his people through sport, and that is why he decides to join rugby players, who belong to the world-wide measure to outsiders.
The South African team managed to reach the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked several years to get Mandela's story to the cinemas.
He had no other goal than to play this role in such a way that it was as much like reality as possible, said Freeman.
Of course, the greatest challenge was to talk like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were out of the same area, he would have tried meeting Mandela, having dinner with him, being behind the scenes before his speech.
Most importantly, I wanted to shake Mandela's hand.
I found out that by shaking her hand, I received her energy, she was transmitted and had the feeling of knowing how you feel, she said.
It's important to me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon plays the role of François Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team, in which white players predominated.
The actor said he had had six months to prepare for a role in the hard world of rugby.
A great surprise to him was, when he finally met with Pienaar for the first time in his home.
I remember calling at the door, he opened and the first thing I told François Pienaar in my life was: \"In the film I look much higher\"
Despite the obvious differences between the characters of the actors and their real models, and under the management of Director Eastwood, Invictus: Invincible received positive reviews and is also talking about ambitions for the Oscar.
The film critic of the Daily Variety Todd McCarthy summed up his evaluation with these words: \"It was a very good story, a very well-made film\"
In the film reviews on the website rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive reviews.
The secret of the splendour on resolved Norway: the Russians tested a missile
A special luminous effect of unknown origin was observed on Norway.
The Ministry of Defence of Russia eventually acknowledged yesterday that near the borders with Norway tested a ballistic intercontinental missile.
The launch failed again. The missile, of type-Bulava, formerly destined to be the pride of the Russian army, is becoming the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Not even its repeated presence in missile tests has had the desired effect on the success of test flights.
Bulavá, in most cases, did not fly or a failure occurred in the air.
In Russian newspapers, he writes of \"Buvlavá\" as \"a non-flying missile\"
A missile that doesn't fly, but it shines.
During this, the 13th test, there was at first no problem.
At the end of the flight there were new technical problems in the apparatus.
The engine probably crashed into the third stage of the missile.
This time \"Buvlavá\" was launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskoy, which floated submerged in the White Sea.
This type of missile allows the launch from a ship that is moving and submerged at the same time.
That's why it's likely that the mysterious light on Norway, caused by an unidentified flying object, was actually the failed -- \"Bulava\"
The Norwegians have not hesitated since the first moment to make it a Russian missile.
The generals this time defend themselves by stating that one cannot simply speak of a failure.
The first two stages of the missile endured and the failure occurred in the third.
In previous cases the engines were immediately discovered in the first stage.
Although none of the launches went completely wrong, according to the Ministry of Defence management, only six out of the thirteen were failed.
The success of almost fifty percent full of optimism to the generals and therefore continue to state that \"Bulavá\" will one day fly smoothly and that it will even manage to carry up to ten nuclear hypersonic blocks, the maximum total weight of which is 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with Moscow's CSKA at age 51
The legendary defender Viacheslav Fetisov will return to a professional hockey meeting at the age of 51.
The world's former champion, Olympic champion and winner of the Stanley Cup will help his CSKA Moscow team and possibly play Friday at the KHL duel against St. Petersburg.
Fetisov finished his professional career at the age of 40 in 1998 and currently presides over the CSKA.
After Denis Kulyash was injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov is constantly practicing and committed to helping the team.
We just have to solve some formal issues, cited the AP agency to Sergei Nemchinov, the coach of the Moscow club.
It is still unclear whether the famous player's return will refer to a single game.
I think Fetisov is one of those who manage to raise the spirits of the other players, Nemchinov mentioned.
According to AP if Fetisov returns to ice tracks, it will become the longest professional player in Russian hockey.
The legendary foreman Gordie Howe played at the NHL by Hartford at the age of fifty-one years, during the entire season, and achieved 15 goals and 26 attendances.
The largest group of the five famous players Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
Playing for the Soviet Union, he won two Olympic gold, seven world championships, triumphed at the Canada Cup and the junior world championship.
In the second part of his career he was also successful in the NHL: playing with Detroit twice won the Stanley Cup.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the Hockey Gloria Room.
Hyundai met the requirements of the unions. He will cancel all the additional work
The management of the car factory in Nošovice agreed with the unions to cancel all the additional work.
Precisely because of the frequent supplementary work, the unions declared on Monday the emergency by strike.
The information was confirmed by Petr Vaněk, the spokesperson for the Hyundai automobile factory.
The management, however, wants this year to agree with the unions one more Saturday shift.
We cannot resign to our manufacturing plan, because it is essential. That is why we proposed voluntary supplementary work for Saturday, December 19, that is to say, it will work in two shifts, Vaněk said.
According to the Sedmička.cz server, the company offered a 400 CZK bonus to employees working on the Saturday shift.
The bonus will also be paid on Saturday, November 28th.
According to Vaňka, the company decided to change the way it motivated its employees with the additional work offered.
Employees can charge the bonus for extra hours or take a day off on December 28th, that is to say prolong Christmas parties in one day, Vaněk mentioned.
In addition, all employees on Saturday's shifts will receive money for the trip and for the meal.
Because supplementary work was the most urgent and problematic point of comments and complaints by trade unionists and strikers, who stopped manufacturing last week, the address yesterday afternoon decided immediately to cancel all additional work for the month of December, Vaněk mentioned.
The employees of the automobile factory were forced to work two more hours in addition to eight-hour shifts, and this situation lasted almost every day until last week.
After signing the agreement, the unions will cancel the strike emergency.
Another negotiation between the management of the factory and the trade unionists must take place on Monday morning.
The head of the Petr Kuchař trade unions said on Wednesday, that if they commit to comply with the requirements and sign the document, they are prepared to cancel the emergency by strike.
The situation in the automobile factory worsened last week on Wednesday, when approximately 400 employees spontaneously went into strike for the frequent supplementary work.
They also protested against poor conditions of payment and alleged harassment.
The management felt that employees had to work extra hours to meet the requirements and be able to supply cars.
Trade unionists in their statement of emergency by Monday strike also demanded that none of the employees, which last Wednesday interrupted the manufacture, be penalized in any way.
As far as supplementary work is concerned, trade unions demand that the company reduce it to a minimum.
In addition, this year, a remuneration of 5,000 crowns is required for this work.
The car factory in Nošovice Hyundai currently has 2,000 employees.
Serial manufacturing was started last November.
Until last September it produced approximately 80,000 automobiles; its current productive potential is 200,000 cars per year.
A Czech discovery: an effective substance even in the 'hot' HIV virus
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds that can moderate the spread of HIV in the organism
The main advantage of this improved substance is that it is also effective against drug-resistant viruses.
In some cases this is more important than the fact that the compound is not as effective in a common variant of the virus, such as some already accessible medicines.
AIDS can't be cured so far.
However, patients' lives may be significantly extended by a mixture of medicines that prevent the replication of HIV in the body.
However, its use has many side effects.
If virus replication is not completely suppressed, so-called resistant viruses will be created; against them, medicines no longer work.
The work of experts from three Institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, VŠCHT Prague and Heidelberg University demonstrates the possibility of mastering the resistance of the virus.
They showed that substances called metalocarborans have an effect on albumin, responsible for the spread of HIV.
Metalocarbons are composed of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus in a way other than all medicines used today, and that is why they can solve the problem of resistance.
In their work scientists find new, ‘best’ compounds, prepared knowing the molecular mechanism of their link to the albumin of the virus.
The metalocarborans have a single three-dimensional structure: two polyhedron cages composed by the atoms of boron, hydrogen and carbon are joined by the atom of metal, in this case by cobalt.
A Traitor and Resistant Virus
HIV protease is an albumin of the HIV virus, and it is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV protease, the fractionation of the HIV virus does not occur and no mature and infectious body of the virus would be created.
If we stop the HIV protease, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, explain scientists in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In an article published in the journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds, in which two pairs of cages (see table) are joined by a short organic series, which continues to be systematically modified.
A little weaker, but more effective
Test of the effect of this series of HIV protease substances was carried out in probes, and also against their resistant variants obtained from HIV patients.
The effect of metalocarborans on the common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as in clinically used drugs, however they do not lose their effect on resistant variants, in which drugs often do not work.
The mechanism of the single effect, its other qualities such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications, makes metalocarborans interesting compounds for research with the aim of proposing effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlina ¢ezáčová, the head of the structural biology laboratory at the Institute of Organic and Biochemical Chemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics in the Academy of Sciences.
Pelea for the budget. ODS attacked Fischer, he defends
The head of ODS Mirek Topolánek said that the approved budget for the coming year is \"spanky\" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should, according to him, think about its future existence.
The ODS statements were pointed out by the Prime Minister as strong judgements.
They say time is left for analysis.
The vice president of ODS Petr Nečas said that the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party evidently no longer works.
According to Nečas, the prime minister has to decide whether he wants to rely on the minority, who is trying to fight the growing deficit, or whether he wants to remain in his position with the help of the parliamentary left.
The attitude of ODS and social democracy towards the problem of the public deficit is completely different, Nečas warned.
Yesterday's Chamber of Deputies approved the 2010 budget, but with the amendments proposed by the left, for more than 12 billion crowns.
The Chamber of Deputies increased the money for the salaries of state officials, for social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government criticized the ODS proposals, as they greatly increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should govern with the deficit of 163 billion krona.
ODS before the vote came out of the room and thus fulfilled the government's wish, that the amended budget is better than a provisional budget.
Disillusionment and inoperability
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and feelings of worthlessness; Prime Minister Jan Fischer mentioned that the government will reassess the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota seriously threatened with resignation in the event of the adoption of the amending proposals, the situation could have been different.
According to Česká TVe Janota requested a meeting with the Prime Minister.
He pointed out that he's thinking of staying in the function.
The reason is your disappointment at the budget negotiations.
If Fischer agrees with another fight against the budget deficit, according to Nečas in the government, they have nothing to do with those nominated by the ČSSD, which imposed the changes in the budget.
The Prime Minister should also say clearly, if he resigns, if the House approves other laws that increase the deficit, for example those that relate to sickness subsidies, incomes, or the amendment of the law of service.
Topolánek: Ministers appointed by the ODS are not guilty
It is the matter of Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The ministers appointed by the ODS have done nothing wrong, underlined Topolánek in the U.S. news of text.
He recalled, that in several ministries in the post of lieutenants there are people who belong to TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed, that if Fischer decides to re-sign the principle of the struggle with the height of the deficit of the public estate, - it is absolutely logical and correct, that he supports the left majority, which is currently in the Chamber of Deputies -
However, it will not have the support and tolerance of ODS members.
I have not thought about that, when the time comes, I will take care of it, told journalists in the Chamber of Deputies the Minister of Defense Martin Barták, who was appointed for the government precisely by the members of ODS.
Prime Minister Fischer came to a meeting of the European Council in Brussels in the afternoon.
ODS yielded at the request of the Prime Minister
Nečas stressed that on Wednesday in the Chamber of Deputies he would probably vote against the amended budget, if the Prime Minister did not explicitly ask the ODS Members to allow the budget to be accepted.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not small children, he responded to the question, if ODS does not care about the absence of the party leader in parliament and in the Czech Republic, during the budget negotiations.
I didn't realize my vote was missing.
Upon resigning the mandate he knew, that in the following months he was mainly about the Bolshevization of the Chamber of Deputies and the destruction of all positive things, he reacted to Topolánek himself.
According to the new train schedule ČD will circulate fewer trains for almost the same rates
České dráhy (Czech Railways) starting on 13 December will cancel or restrict some less used fast and local trains and, on the contrary, will reinforce some links.
The total extent of traffic will be reduced by two percent compared to today, after the new train schedule enters into force.
Most rates including basic and customer prices will not change.
More possibilities of links to the capital will win for example the inhabitants of the region of Ostravsko, dráhy for this line will add a pendulum pipeline.
The direct train, on the contrary, will no longer circulate to Bratislava.
On the line Prague - Pisek - České Budějovice will circulate less fast trains, the direct links Prague - Letohrad will be restricted.
In the regions, the largest drop in traffic planned by drahy is in the region of Hradec Kralové, eight percent in total, on the contrary, the transport will increase in Prague and the surrounding areas.
Two night trains will also be cancelled in Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice and some fast trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line will be reduced only to a few days of the week.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, the inhabitants of Milovice have to change in Lysá nad Labem.
This is the 15th line of the Esko system, in the surrounding cities, its opening is possible thanks to the electrification of the line from Lysá nad Labem to Milovice.
The long-distance links to the capital will end at Prague Hlavní station nádraží.
ČD will enter more links SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will circulate every two hours.
From 13 December, travellers will no longer travel to Bratislava in Pendolino.
This year's regional railways account: 200 million more than before
The fast trains are commissioned and paid by the Ministry of Transport, to cover the so-called demonstrable losses Dráhy will receive the year coming four billion crowns in total, just like this year. Local trains are commissioned by the regions, next year will pay eight billion crowns in total, and the state will help them almost three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
For fast and local trains drahy have a new ten-year contract, so far the contract was always a year.
Dráhy are happy with the system, and perhaps that's why they didn't raise the prices of a large majority of the tickets.
The changes will take place only on one-day tickets - ČD Net and on the cheap internet tickets eLiška.
For travellers without a customer card the price ČD Net will increase from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price of eLiška will depend on the distance, so far there was the unique price of 160 crowns for trips between any two regional cities.
Philippine armies continue to hold more than 50 people, children were released
Armed forces have today kidnapped 75 people in the south of the Philippines, including a number of primary school students and their teachers.
This was stated by the AFP agency, which previously reported only about 65 kidnappings.
All 17 children in detention and one teacher were released after eight hours.
The kidnapping occurred in the province of Agusan del Sur.
They say that approximately 19 armed men use hostages as a living shield in the escape from the police.
Local negotiators are trying to agree to the surrender of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the armed forces belong to the New Popular Armada (NPA), an armed fraction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP agency, the police previously persecuted the kidnappers due to violence, the cause of which was the adjustment of the accounts between two clans of the local families.
In the southern Philippines in the province of Maguindanao was because of the recent killing, in which 57 people died, imposed martial law.
Among the victims of the 23rd November massacre, related to the governor's elections, were 30 journalists.
Suspected of the involvement in the killing, the governor of this province was arrested in the south of the Philippines and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of an influential dynasty of the Ampatuans.
Muslim separatists also operate on Mindanao Island.
However, on Tuesday they renewed the peace dialogues with the Philippine government.
RSA's story refers to everyone, says Morgan Freeman aka Mandela
In the next few days, a new Hollywood film by Clint Eastwood Invictus (his official title in Czech is Invictus: Neporažený), which captures a part of the biography of the former President of the South African Republic Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous apartheid fighter is played by Morgan Freeman, who chose for the leading role Mandela himself years ago.
The second role, that of the legendary champion in rugby Francoise Pienaar, was played by Matt Damon.
With the premiere of the reactions of critics and the public
Nelson Mandela
His full name is Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela. He was born on July 18, 1918 in Mvezo, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sacharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, in 1993 he received, along with Klerk's, the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
great hopes, as it comes to the public at the time, when in the Republic of South Africa they culminate in preparations for the world football championship. At the same time the media are shaken by alarming news about the growing racial hatred and discrimination of the inhabitants by the dominant black majority.
According to the AP news agency, the reactions to this new film in RSA have been positive, despite numerous reservations against the distribution of the roles leading to the - little interesting - Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman, however, says he's proud of the new movie.
For many years I dreamed of the role and was well prepared to play it.
Many times I met Nelson Mandela in person, to - as it is said - collect his energy, he mentioned in an interview after the festive premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's good, if we can remember Mandela's character and message through the film.
It is a history of the Republic of South Africa, but it refers to everyone, he added.
In the costume of the national rugby team
The film is based on the book by British writer John Carlin with the title freely translated In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game. Thanks to this game the nation was born. Portrait of South African human rights lawyer during his first election presidential period.
Morgan Freeman in the film is trying to unite two groups of people, racially and for long separate years. Like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he as protagonist also puts on the suit of the South African rugby team and enters the playing field. RSA won the world cup at that time.
By entering the grass in the suit, which in RSA is considered almost sacred, Mandela fourteen years ago won great ovations, especially from the white public and the recognition of white inhabitants.
The football championship may help people to unite and form a nation, mentioned the rugby player Chester Williams, the only - black - on the national team in 1995.
It will still be seen, if it improves the tense situation in the RSA.
However, white South Africans are skeptical, as said in a recent interview for LN, a rugby amateur Christopher Dawson, who fled from his country to Britain.
The championship begins on June 11, 2010.
In Lounsko burns a transformer with a value of tens of millions of crowns
The fire caught a transformer of the company Čeps in a switch box near the village Výškov in Lounsko in the morning.
According to Lukaš Marvan, the spokesperson for firefighters in the Ustí region, the fire is extinguished by six groups.
Formerly the firefighters wanted to let the transformer be destroyed by fire, yet later they changed their mind and the fire was extinguishing it with a mixture of water, foam and a special extinguisher matter.
The fire was caused by a technical defect, the short circuit of the transformer.
There were no injuries, according to Pavla Mandatotá, the carrier of the company, the damage does not endanger the safe operation of the distribution system.
The estimated damage is several million crowns, listing it exactly will not be possible before the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandatotá, it will be necessary to replace the transformer destroyed by a new one.
During the ten years of Čeps' activity nothing like this happened, this kind of damage is sporadic, he added.
According to Sona Holingerová Hendrychová, the spokesperson of the company ČEZ for the north Czech Republic, the supplies of the electric current were not cut, and the fire of the electrical substation does not affect the operation of homes, offices or companies.
A.s. Čeps pŭsobí in the territory of the Czech Republic as sole maintainer of the distribution system, the electric conduction of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It retains in good condition, renews and develops 39 switch boxes with 67 transformers, which carry the electrical energy of the transmission system to the distributor system, and maintains the electrical conduction of 4339 kilometers long.
Jančura will file a complaint for slander to three Hetmans of ČSSD
The owner of Student Agency Radim Jančura today will file a complaint for slander to three social democratic hetmans.
It is Michal Hašek of the Jihomoravský kraj region, Radko Martínek of Pardubický kraj and the hetmam of Olomoucký kraj Martin Tesařík.
Jančura mentioned it in 20 minutes in Radiožurnál.
The demand has to do with the company's effort, maintaining regional rail transport in some regions.
All regions however ended up signing long-term contracts with České dráhy.
All three Hetmans are attacking us and talking about the fact that we are - taking the pastels of the cake - yet we brought only the offer for what they themselves wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than České dráhy, which is not true. We know the prices of České dáhy, which were fixed last week.
So there's nothing left but to defend ourselves.
It is by slander towards Student Agency society, he said for Radiožurnál Jančura.
He mentioned at the same time having evidence from all regions, and he said that he did not take necessary measures in harmony with European law.
That is why he is preparing an incentive for the European Commission.
Hašek considers this complaint for the continuation of Mr Jančura's media show, which serves as a free publicity for his company and for himself.
Of course I am prepared to defend my good reputation and that of my region and I appeal to the other Hetmans to do so too.
I suppose, also on this occasion it will be clearly demonstrated, that Mr Jančura manipulates the public in the matter of regional rail transport, and uses lying and false arguments, said Hašek.
Jančura announced last week that it would invest several million crowns in advertising, whose aim would be to warn of these measures in the regions.
Radiožurnál told him that he would interrupt the campaign after Christmas and want to continue after the new year.
It required that the campaign be carried out against corruption as such.
Jančura started the campaign after the regions agreed with České dráhy to maintain regional railway links and for the commission of approximately 150 billion crowns did not call a tenar.
According to Jančura similar steps disagree with the law and the opinion of the European Court.
Jančura claims to have been threatened by a Member of ČSSD, because of his criticism of rail transport in the regions.
The only threat was, if we don't leave, we'll be able to lose our bus licenses.
He presented himself as a Member of ČSSD, I know, what lord it is, I am not going to say his name, Jančura said today for Radiožurnál.
Neumoccal vaccine will be free of charge and voluntary
The neococal vaccine from January will put an end to usual customs.
As the first vaccine should be free for families and at the same time voluntary.
However, opinions have already appeared, that the mandatory vaccine would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of the free vaccine against pneumococcals culminate.
The Institute for Medicinal Products is already fixing the maximum prices for vaccines, which will be covered by insurance companies.
The experts have already made this clear in the vaccination procedure.
The new vaccine
Free vaccines for children born in August
From January, children born since 2 August last year may be free of charge of the neumoccal vaccine.
The condition is not to have received a dose of the vaccine before.
Those who started with the vaccine last year or before must cover other doses of the vaccine as well.
The first dose of the vaccine should be received between the third and fifth months of child age.
Last year the fourth of the families voluntarily allowed their children to be vaccinated against neumococcals.
The parents, however, paid for a dose of 1600 crowns and more.
Four doses are needed to immunize younger children.
Experts generally estimate that insurance companies will spend 300 to 450 thousand kroner vaccines annually.
Without clutch they will save for treatment, which is needed for children who are not vaccinated.
So far the state has spent the entire vaccination of children about 500,000 annually.
Covered vaccination was initiated by the so-called package of Janota.
Neumococcus is the cause of middle otitis, but also of serious infections including meningitis and septicemia.
Neumoccal infections in our country each year die according to hospital research 28 children not older than 10 years of age.
In addition to Czechia, neomocal vaccine coverage in children was introduced in approximately 40 countries.
Is the vaccine mandatory?
However, opinions appear at the same time, that this vaccine could be mandatory in the future.
From January it must be covered by insurance and voluntary companies.
The mandatory vaccine would be better, noted for example Rudolf Kalovský, the head of the civic association Nahlas.
Its association propagates the neococal vaccines for a long time now.
The experts at an international conference, in which our association participated, were not fully satisfied with the fact that we have the voluntary vaccine.
It's not completely ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy to get at least this.
I think this is the path that we now have to take, mentioned Kalovský.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the procedure for vaccination against pneumonia.
At this moment we did not think of it at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
Voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages, doctors say
The president of the pediatrician company Odborná společnost praktických dětských lekařŭ Hana Cabrnochová acknowledges that the voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages.
If all children receive the vaccine, they can be reasoned on the reduction in the number of doses. -In the situation, when the vaccine is so high, we relatively understand the political decision to have initiated vaccination as a voluntary one, says Cabrnochová.
Experts expect that from the coming year more than 80 percent of young parents will let their babies be vaccinated against pneumococcals.
The neococal vaccine is also a big change because as the first vaccination in children is covered by health companies, not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend more money on prophylaxis, to save later on treatment, explains Cabrnochová.
Doctors will have to buy the vaccines for themselves.
However, pediatricians are concerned about the purchase of vaccines.
Previously, vaccines had to be purchased by insurance companies and distributed to doctors, just as the state gave them other vaccines.
Some Members, however, were afraid, that insurance companies could — loot health insurance money —
The doctors will have to buy the vaccines and wait, until they are paid by the insurance companies.
It is estimated that pediatricians will invest in vaccines 40,000 a month, which is a remarkable sum.
It won't be easy, says Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved in the theft of a museum
The son of the renowned American fantasy artist, Frank Frazetta, has been accused of trying to steal paintings valued at 20 million US dollars (12 million pounds) from his father's museum.
Pennsylvania police say Alfonso Frank Frazetta was trapped while loading 90 pictures on his vehicle and trailer.
They claim that Frazetta and another man used an excavator to raid the museum in the Pocono Mountains region.
Frazetta father, 81, is famous for her representation of such characters as Conan the Barbaro and Tarzan.
News Agency Associated Press reported that the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP reported that an unidentified police officer claimed that a family dispute could have motivated young Frazetta.
The agency reported that his 52-year-old son, Frazatta, told the police that his father had ordered him - to enter the museum by any means to transfer all the paintings to a warehouse -
The agency said Frazetta father refused to grant such permission.
Labour party defends tax increases in the budget
Ministers have defended tax increases and cut spending in the pre-budget report, in the face of opposition criticism, businesses and trade unions.
The Conservatives said that Alistair Darling - wasted - an opportunity to show her seriousness about reducing the deficit, delaying decisions until after the elections.
The Minister of Finance also received harsh criticism for harming low- and medium-income workers.
Its main proposals include an increase of 0.5% of social security expenditure and a 1 % ceiling on public sector wage agreements from 2011.
Colera for Social Security
Trade unions have regretted that low-wage workers are punished with a recession generated by others, and warned about futures - problems -
The increase in social security spending, which will grow about £3 billion a year, has angered the business community, which states that this is a job tax, when the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, limited to those who earn more than £20,000 per year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
CLEAR POINTS OF THE REPORT TO THE BUDGET
Social Security with an additional 0.5 % increase from April 2011
Economy will contract more than expected 4.75 % this year
New 50% tax on bankers' bonds
The rise of 1 point of the corporation tax for small firms was discarded.
Tax reliefs for electric cars and wind turbines
State pension would increase by 2.5 %
According to the Ministry of Finance estimates, a person who earns £30,000 will lose £90 a year and who earns £40,000 will lose £190, while a person who wins £10,000 a year will earn £110.
The Ministers said that their objective of halving the deficit for 2013 involved — difficult decisions — but insisted that 60% of the additional tax burden would fall on 5% of the highest wages.
The Minister of Finance, Stephen Timms, denied that tax increases and delineated expenditure cuts were a \"sand grain in the desert\" compared to what was needed.
“These are large figures. It will allow us to reduce the deficit to half, which is absolutely essential for the next four years,” he told the BBC.
Mr. Timms said he was confident that the economy would grow again by the end of the year.
However, the Labour Party's forecasts for future economic growth, which will influence the amount to be borrowed and the speed with which the deficit is reduced, have been questioned after the Finance Minister has been forced to change the first figures.
In his statement, he stated that the economy would probably be contracted by 4.75 % this year, much worse than the 3,5 % decrease forecasted in April, while the loan demand would be £3 billion above the previously estimated.
\"Missed opportunity\"
The Conservatives, who will launch a new publicity campaign on Thursday, warning about — the debt crisis — of the Labour Party, said that the projection of demand for loans for £789 billion for the next six years was unsustainable.
The Ministers had failed to present a credible plan on how they would return the money, they added, detonating, cynically, the difficult options until after the elections to be held in June 2010.
\"They have not included anything significant about what they will do,\" said the Minister in the shadow of the Ministry of Finance, Philip Hammond. \"They had the opportunity to do it and they wasted it.\"
\"All major announcements will be made after the elections, win the winner.\"
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The Labour Party insists that schools, hospitals and the police will be protected from future cuts, unlike conservative proposals, which would seek a further reduction in the short-term deficit.
But the democratic liberals claimed that the money raised by tax increases and spending cuts would be used to sustain next year's spending, not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the projects were like - sand castles -
BBC political editor Nick Robinson said that the time chosen for advertisements, such as the increase in inflation of some disability subsidies for the next April, mentioned above, would leave the Finance Minister exposed to accusations of electoral maneuvers, as the money could simply be recovered the following year.
However, the Labour Party insists that it is providing people with the greatest need and will review the situation in September 2010.
\"Falmly suspected\"
Although the ministers did not publish the post-2011 expenditure data, economists said it was clear that the adjustment of public spending would only be felt in the medium term.
The respected Institute of Tax Studies said that the figures of the Minister of Finance involved substantial cuts in many areas, potentially including in the future transport, higher education, science and defence.
\"This is actually postponing pain for later on,\" said his director, Robert Chote.
“All major ads will come after the election, win the winner,” added Roger Bootle, economic consultant for Deloitte’s accountants.
\"This has been the false pre-budget report. Markets realize this.\"
The FBI is investigating U.S. arrests in Pakistan.
The FBI is investigating the detention in Pakistan of five U.S. men suspected of extremist connections.
The American Embassy of Pakistan told the BBC that the men were arrested on a raid to a house in Sarghoda in the eastern province of Punjab.
The FBI said it's investigating whether they're the same men who disappeared from their homes in the state of Virginia, U.S.A. last month.
The United States Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it was also looking for information about men.
It is reported that three of them are of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
\"If they are American citizens, of course we will be very interested in the charges for which they have been arrested and in what kind of circumstances they are being held,\" said the spokesman, Ian Kelly.
FBI spokesman Katherine Schweit said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
\"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identities and the nature of their business there, if in fact these are the students who were missing,\" said the spokesperson.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington said that the men were arrested in a house that belongs to one of them's uncle.
He said that the house was already in the sight of the local police and that no charges had yet been brought against the detainees.
The Foreign Minister, Hillary Clinton, refused to comment on arrests, reported the news agency Reuters; but said that the U.S. had to work more closely with both Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to eradicate the terrorism infrastructure that continues to recruit and train people -
The families of the five students reported their disappearance in North Virginia in late November.
Amnesty International sentence — Iranian abuse
Human rights in Iran over the past 20 years have always been equally deficient, according to a report by the Amnesty International campaign group.
The report details - models of abuse - of the regime, before and after the presidential elections held in June.
One man quoted in the report said that he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said that he was threatened with rape.
Iran has rejected previous criticisms of its history of human rights.
Officials have said that such criticisms have a political foundation.
Thousands of people arrested and dozens killed in Iran after the election held by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad sparked the largest street protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens of people have been sentenced, and prosecutors claim that at least five people have been sentenced to death.
BBC correspondent Jon Leyne, who is now in London, says that during the protests, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Jameni, acknowledged some accusations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, the authorities have shown very little tolerance for criticism, according to our correspondent.
\"False confession\"
Amnesty International quoted the story of Ebrahim Mehtari, a 26-year-old computer student, who said he was accused of \"working with Facebook networks\" and protesting the outcome of the elections.
\"They often hit me in the face\" according to their words.
\"They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, in my head... they threatened to execute me and humiliated me\"
Amnesty said that after five days he signed a false confession and released him and abandoned him on the street, still bleeding and semi-conscious.
In August, the defeated presidential candidate, Mehdi Karroubi, said that some protesters arrested after the election had been tortured to death in prison, and others had been raped.
Iranian officials denied the allegations of rape, but admitted that there had been abuses.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee, who claimed that he was held in a container along with 75 other persons for more than eight weeks, at a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and the judiciary had established committees to investigate the instability of the post-election and the government's response, but said that the mandate and powers of the agencies were confusing and the parliamentary committee's findings had not been made public.
The group said that at least 90 people had been arrested in the last three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski track was made in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a Bristol site of interest into a competition track.
The Track at the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who competed for cash prizes.
At the top of the slope in Brandon Hill Park was a short jump ramp, opposite a 100 metre long track.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the track, but it was quite frightening.
You can see beneath a beautiful view of the lights of the city titillating.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the county, real talent - added.
The awards were given to the best tricks or maneuvers made on the track.
After the event on Thursday afternoon, the snow will be melted.
They're still us and they're still here.
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters have requested that the construction of minarets be banned and that there is a widespread warning on the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, a North American academic, has written a detailed and studied report on the possible integration of Muslims (which are actually being integrated) into one of the most openly secular societies of the continent.
Some readers will come to this new book as admirers of the author's latest work - Why the French don't like the veils - -Why the French Don't Like Headcarves - (2006), an elegantly argued study of a problem that divided and concerned the country for a decade and a half, and whose effects are still perceived today.
Mr. Bowen's last book has a broader and more ambitious perspective.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is really happening.
Months have passed in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide to the 5-6 million Muslims in France what Mr. Bowen calls - Islamic spaces -
He is a good listener who reproduces debates between teachers and students about the questions they are most interested in.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or in a town hall (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it legitimate for a Muslim to use an interest-based banking system to obtain a mortgage?
It is these seemingly mundane issues, it maintains, things of daily life, those that concern the media more than political dramas.
The author identifies a new generation of magnets, teachers and intellectuals, not one of them of fame, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim scholar and scholar born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open up the debate on how to be a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They cannot fully disseminate this argument.
Conservatives doubt only the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists that Mr. Bowen interviews tend to disagree with his Salafi counterparts, supporters of purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, who currently have a small but influential presence among Muslims in Europe.
Bowen thinks that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But adaptation requires mutual concessions.
It questions the extent to which French political strategists (and the intellectual elite who so fiercely defend secularism) are truly committed to pluralism.
It suggests that Muslims probably have a more unfair treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who have also had to make their historical commitments to secular republicanism.
More than increasing pragmatism, he perceives - an adjustment of values -
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one tends to say \"Yes, but not yet\"
The most desolate panorama of the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other habitat on the planet.
The ice that defines it is melting at an alarming rate, taking with it life that cannot survive anywhere else.
The interests of oil, gas, transport and fishing have focused on newly opened waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors, as a result.
On thin ice, Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, paints a natural history of the northern icon, the polar bear.
Knowing the complicated history and politics of whale hunting, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers, who gave valuable proof in the face of the white bear.
Admiral Nelson's encounter as a brave 14-year-old cadet, fighting only with the end of his musket, is probably a myth, but others are true.
The young, caught while swimming following the bodies of their newly exterminated mothers, were trapped and sent to zoos and circuses.
A circus presentation in the early 20th century, exhibited 75 polar bears at the same time.
Even today, zoos are still a billionth of the area of the field of a wild adult. The climate is hardly adequate: a polar bear living in Singapore became green by algae growing within the hairless areas of its fur.

Ellis uses stories from other writers and historians, and often returns to the threat that hunters present to species survival.
Although banned in Norway, the U.S. and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where helicopter hunters and entourage Indians use high-powered assault rifles to destroy their prey.
Ironically, it is in the waters north of those two hunting nations where the ice will last longer.
In his new book, \"After the ice,\" \"After the Ice,\" Alu Anderson, an ancient editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and chilling account of Arctic science and an overcrowding look at how the future of that place can be transformed.
It is not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of change.
It's not because of lack of commitment.
The pioneer trips of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries gave indications for the first time about the displacement of ice masses.
Then the submarines of the cold war drew a map of the ice cords that circulate under the ice masses.
Satellite explorations and the extensive series of probes mounted on the icebergs are a useful supplement, but resistant cold-camped individuals still perform many tasks.
Mr. Anderson looks into the extraordinary, tiny world of the flowing system within the arctic ice, made up of saltwater sores that are compressed as it freezes.
But from the bear on the surface to the microscopic wonders of the interior, they are all condemned once the summer ice is removed, which is believed to happen sometime between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months... these could be us
Marines among the 6,000 who place crowns in the graves of Arlington
Pfc. De'Angello Robinson, 19, traveled seven hours by bus to place a single crown in the tomb of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, N.C., to the Arlington National Cemetery to decorate tombs, it was a day to pay homage to men and women who once stood on their boots.
In a few months, from where they're embarking on us, these could be us, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If it's us, I'd want someone to do the same for me, so I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of over 6,000 volunteers who met on Saturday morning to place crowns in the veterans' graves in several sections of the Arlington Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of the Worcester Crown Company in Harrington, Maine, launched the event when he and others decided to decorate several hundred tombs in the Arlington Cemetery.
In what is already an 18-year-old tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen make the trip each year by stopping in different cities along the way, to organize events dedicated to military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcester also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which has extended the event to other states.
This year the volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns in the tombs of the Arlington Cemetery, areas in the Pentagon, tombs at the Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, the Battery Park in New York City and on the memorial site for United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation donated over $150,000 to purchase and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said he made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a deceased military career.
As long as her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that this was his way of giving compensation to those who made sacrifices.
This is a modest way in which civilians can support our troops, he said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Wrapped in warm clothes, the volunteers walked through the broad meadows and hills of the cemetery.
Volunteers went to the oldest graves of World War I, World War II, and the Vietnam War, because they did not receive as many visits as the new tombs, the organizers said.
The atmosphere was cheerful as the children played and the couples took their hands, while they carried the fresh pine to the tombstones.
Each circular crown was of a deep green, with a small red tie at the top.
Near there, Section 60, where most of the veterans of the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, remained virtually silent.
The United Service Organizations (Association for the soldier) donated 1,000 crowns to decorate the section, but the dark atmosphere of the current wars invaded the area.
People cried openly, others prayed, and families and friends supported each other in the glacial air.
Some read aloud names carved in the stones, while others bowed to see small white and black plates placed inside the wet clay, for those whose pencils have not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who shed the tears of her eyes in front of her son’s tomb.
He worked eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the tomb of marine gunman Sgto. David Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free. My son paid for it, he said.
\"A long time after my death, I want someone to remember.\"
Cuban officials arrested a U.S. government contractor
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. government contractor who distributes mobile and laptops in the country, officials in the State Department said on Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc, based in Bethesda.
The company works on customer projects such as the United States International Development Agency and the World Bank.
Consular officers together with the United States Interests Section in Havana are seeking access to the detainee, who was arrested on 5 December.
Specific charges have not been made public, although according to Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost anything that is considered \"dangerous \" .
All activities called counter-revolutionary, including mild protests and critical writings, involve the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has an incipient blogger community, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has on several occasions requested permission to leave the country to accept prizes, but permission has been denied to him.
The arrest of an American contractor can probably cause tensions between the communist government of the Castro brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration, which has been looking for an approach - at a slow pace - to improve relations with the island.
The New York Times was the first to announce the news of the arrest on Friday night.
The new American policy emphasizes that if the Cuban government takes concrete measures, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for opposition, there will be reciprocity on the part of the United States.
Mobiles and laptops are legal in Cuba, even if they are new and coveted in a country where the average salary of a government worker is $15 per month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobiles only this year; they are used mostly for text messages, as a 15-minute telephone conversation would cost the daily salary.
The use of the Internet is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and for foreign visitors to the hotel, and in some government establishment, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often have to give their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The detention of an American in Cuba is unusual.
Gloria Berbena, a press officer in the United States Interests Section in Havana, said that most of the handful of U.S. citizens in prison in Cuba are among the gangs for crimes such as drug trafficking.
Berbena said he couldn't provide any more information about the arrest.
Arrest and detention are clearly uncertain.
An activity that would be legal in any other open society, such as distributing free mobiles, in Cuba is a crime, said José Miguel Vivanco, director of the programme of the Americas of the Human Rights Watch organization, who recently published a hard report on the freedoms in Cuba, called \"New Castro, Cuba itself,\" a reference to Raúl Castro's location as leader of the country, to replace his sickest brother Fidel.
Vivanco said the accused are often detained, prosecuted and imprisoned in one day.
He stated that any solution would probably be political, and that the Cuban government often causes a negative reaction in the United States, just when the two countries begin to have more dialogue.
Pakistani officials untie a plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday the Pakistani authorities neutralized the alleged brain of a plot to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops, stating that they expect the case to help unravel an extensive network of terrorist recruiters, who are using the Internet in search of radicalized youth.
The researchers said they were chasing a mysterious insurgent figure, known as Saifullah, who invited men to Pakistan after finding out that one of them made comments approving terrorist attacks on the YouTube website.
Saifullah led men once they were in Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt, which is a familiar place for the Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence officer who had been informed about the case, stated on Saturday that Saifullah could not convince al-Qaeda commanders that men were not part of a CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
They were therefore isolated for several days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the imposing mountains of the northwest, which have become a terrorist paradise.
They were considered as part of a covert operation.
For this reason they were rejected, said the official, who spoke from anonymity due to the delicacy of the case.
The official said that the men did not move and were even trying to get proper approval to access the camps of al-Qaeda, when the Pakistani police authorities arrested them.
The case of the five men, who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI, stresses the critical role of recruiters in the identification of potential terrorists and, perhaps most importantly, determines who are trustworthy.
Since the September 11, 2001, U.S. intelligence has made it the top priority to try to infiltrate people within the Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as guards, not allowing those who do not show a serious commitment to the holy war, and those who might be spies.
The analysts said that al Qaeda examines with special attention the aspiring American recruits.
But for the organization they represent a huge attraction, due to their potential to have access to U.S. goals and due to their value of propaganda.
But Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst for the U.S.-based NEFA Foundation, said that terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years with regard to those who admit, because U.S. intelligence agencies have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way than following the recruitment model than so many have already followed? Kohlmann said.
It has become a much more web-based model.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen, demanding - action - climate
On Saturday, tens of thousands of protesters marched here on the streets demanding the negotiators working at the Bella Center Convention Center of the city, bolder actions for the climate.
Protesters said that 100,000 people participated in the event, but the police felt that the amount was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists placed small explosives near a group of government buildings in the city centre.
On a day when little happened in the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists walked through the city holding signposts in English saying, \"There is no planet B,\" and one in Spanish declaring, \"the Earth says enough\"
Several celebrities joined the protest, including the Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that the journeys of Peru, the native country of her mother, made me aware of the distressing issues that the country must deal with because of the impacts of the climate changes that are already happening. —
This is part of the reason why I have decided to join the great demonstration, to spread the word and appeal to the world's leaders, to present a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, he expressed.
This is not an easy task, but it has to be done, there is no way to avoid it for longer.
The police prevented protesters from getting too close to the Bella Center, and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because of the use of masks or wearing pocket knives.
According to Danish law, such activities are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to one witness, who asked not to be identified for being involved in climate talks, activists with sports masks and black outfits placed several explosives near the Copenhagen main channel, which is close to several ministries.
They were around the buildings, he said, adding that they started as called, but that they were followed by — a couple of large explosions —
Within the convention center, people gathered around the television screens to watch the march throughout the afternoon.
But the protest did not seem to penetrate the consciousness of key officials like Su Wei, China's chief negotiator on climate.
When asked whether he thought the demonstration was having a constructive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, \"I really wasn't aware of the situation.\"
Then he kept saying in Mandarin, -as the meeting place is great, I can't hear what goes on outside -
He pointed out that it depended on the perspective of each one to define whether the march was being detrimental or beneficial.
He said that this shows the public's attention in general and from different sectors to the issue of climate change.
On the other hand, it can also be said that they affect the negotiations, or the freedom of other people.
Evidence data reveal persistent racial differences
Last week's Federal Qualifications Bill on Math Performance was a very good news for public schools in the Capital District.
Although the District is still far from the best-performing systems in the country, the Qualifications Note showed that fourth- and eighth-grade students were given a faster pace over the past two years, with respect to the cities of Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is recorded in the recent figures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress is the persistent difference in performance between African American students and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average scores of white students in the fourth grade of the D.C. over the past two years grew from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but their African-American peers increased only three points, from 209 to 212.
In reality, the difference in performance grew between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of the eighth grade African Americans remained essentially fixed, decreasing a statistically insignificant point, from 245 to 244.
The average white scores were not included in the test results, because the sample size was not large enough.
Over a six-year extension, the picture is no longer encouraging.
The difference between the fourth-degree white and black pupils in 2003, when the first ENPE was made known in the District, was 60 points of the scale (262-202).
Although the scores achieved by children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference has barely been reduced to 58.
Some education lawyers in the District expressed concern last week, as the advances made by Rector Michelle A. The Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat), were largely driven by white students, who are already very good students.
This would suggest that we have improved the set by meeting those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and conflicting, expressed Jeff Smith, CEO of D.C. Voice, a non-profit organization that advocates educational equity in the District.
I am not giving leaps of joy by a difference of two or three points, said the D.C. Council member, Kwame R. Brown (Dem.-By accumulation), who has a daughter in the fourth grade of the Elemental Eaton.
Brown, an assiduous critic of Rhee's management style, said that the message of the test scores is that the city's secondary schools have a desperate need for attention.
Clearly, you always want to see positive signs, and I respect them.
But what is concerned is that we are not devoting the time or energy needed for our middle schools.
Rhee said the District needs to continue to find better ways to address the needs of low-performance students.
This autumn, for example, some teachers are being trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at students of the upper grades of primary and middle school, who did not master the foundations of early reading in their school courses and are considerably behind their peers.
Everyday mathematics, a mathematics curriculum from Kindergarten to sixth grade, which emphasizes real-life games and experiences, which was introduced in the District under former Superintendent Clifford Janey, who is believed to be some of the progress reported by ENPE last week.
I just think we have to keep working to offer the best interventions to those students who are below the grade level, Rhee said.
Others say that the results of ENPE highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to increase the overall performance of the system and yet provide additional money and resources for low-performance schools, which will be needed to reduce the difference.
Here is a sort of shaky dilemma for Michelle Rhee, Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California in Berkeley, who studies city test scores.
The solution of conventional policy is to allocate its resources and administrative reforms to schools located in the poorest sections of the D.C.
Then the objective can generate political repercussions that go against that important schedule.
But the problem, of course, is that, like other urban overseers, she tries to cling to the black and white middle class.
Our focus is on ensuring that we build a system of excellent schools.
We need to strengthen our barral schools, so that all families, without regard to where they live, have confidence that their children can access excellent public education.
Janey, now a Newark school overseer, said in an interview this week that an essential element in ending the performance gap is to extend the traditional public school year, now 180 days in the District, to compete with autonomous schools.
It is almost 200 days to have the force of change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with the union of his teachers last year in a year of 185 days, which he regards as an \"indicator\" to seek a greater increase in the next convention.
Making higher education a part of more future
The tourist bus arrived at the University of Gettysburg with a strong relief.
Graciela Rodríguez, 12 years old, descended and blinked for a moment before the white columns, brick facades and emerald meadows.
Graciela's parents had hardly graduated from a high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Still, when she and the other eighth grade students of the group explored Gettysburg, where registration costs $38,690 a year, her attitude was less that of impressed guests than that of enthusiastic potential students.
Yes! That's where I'm going to be! exclaimed Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the guide announced that they had entered the science building.
Caray, seriously?, thoughtfully said, when the guide spoke of the low proportion of teacher-students of the school.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that the children had visited on their three-day trip, and had already completely absorbed their deliberate message: The question is not if you are going to go to college.
The question is which one.
Although there is growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States of Hispanic immigrants who leave high school or become pregnant in adolescence, there are also hundreds of thousands who access the university education they need to access the middle class.
In fact, one out of five of these second-generation Hispanics has graduated from university, a remarkable achievement given that many of their immigrant parents, especially Mexican and Central American, entered the United States without completing high school.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because they point out the way forward for a generation that will play a very important role in the country's workforce.
Those who analyze the highest performance say that they often have a natural affinity for school and an innate tendency to succeed.
Many also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But tutoring programmes can also play an exceptional role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her to reach the university, particularly if efforts are sustained in time.
Observing low-income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, it is deduced that any intervention at any time is not going to solve it, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who has examined Latin students.
We have to think about providing a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded the tour by Graciela universities is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million per year to local school systems, to run university preparation programs, which begin when low-income students are in middle school and continue until they finish high school.
Since 1999, the program has helped more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent attending the university, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraqi Oil Ministry reaches agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to attract important oil companies to rebuild its fragile infrastructure during two auctions that ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements that the Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum reached with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are prepared to play a major role in the restoration of Iraq's oil industry, maimed by decades of war and sanctions.
The U.S. companies have drifted away having climbed into just two of the 10 understated deposits.
Seven U.S. companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only one who submitted an offer was lost.
Two U.S. companies reached agreements for auctioned deposits in June.
The poor representation of American oil giants in the opening of Iraq's oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, there are Asians and Europeans at the head, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an online news center.
It will be a long time before something else is on offer in Iraq.
Concerns about security, accentuated by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability as the U.S. military retreats, probably prevented U.S. oil companies from taking a stronger risk in Iraq, which has the third most important reserve of world raw, analysts said.
US companies were in some cases at a disadvantage, because rivals, particularly Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, have considerably lower labour costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not respond to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Western Petroleum Inc were the only U.S. companies that reached agreements with the ministry.
The major U.S. firms, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have bonded with the Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum and have provided technical advice in recent years, have drifted away with empty hands.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main protagonists in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The National Petroleum Corporation, owned by the Chinese state, offered in more contracts than any other company and made large investments in contracts for two main sites.
We know that China is about to become a major economic and technological power, spokesperson for the Ministry of Oil Assam Jihad.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be at the same time as its competitors and will meet its commitments to Iraq.
The companies pre-selected to submit proposals made offers that later faced the barrel grant that the ministry was willing to pay to increase production above current levels in each site.
The main planner of al Qaeda has apparently been killed in Pakistan
It is believed that a suspected US missile attack on the Pakistan border with Afghanistan has killed a major Qaeda operations planner this week, U.S. counter-terrorism officials said on Friday.
If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack on a high-ranking terrorist leader this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men who was thought to have died on Tuesday when a couple of missiles hit his car, near the city of Miran Shah, in the North Waziristan province, according to US sources and Pakistani officials in the region.
The local authorities said the missiles were launched by an unidentified aircraft, the type operated by the CIA within Pakistan's illegal tribal zone.
They were driving a white car, heading to the Afghan border, when the car received the impact, said an official of Pakistan's civil intelligence agency, speaking by phone from Miran Shah.
The official said that the suspected local militants rushed to the site and quickly confiscated what was left of the “fully destroyed bodies”
Local authorities were unable to verify the identities of the victims, but two U.S. counter-terrorism officials cited unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as a high-ranking military planner of al-Qaeda, who led the operations of the terrorist group outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He dedicated himself to conspiring around the world, said a high official, who spoke from anonymity, citing the delicate nature of American air attacks within Pakistani territory.
Considering its central role, this probably included conspiracy attacks against the United States and Europe.
He had a strategic guide to the superior command of al Qaeda and translated it into operational patterns for potential terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said that Somali had rapidly ascended the ranks of al Qaeda and was well connected with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be a name known to some Americans, but that does not in any way diminish the threat posed to us and our allies, the second official said.
If his death was confirmed, Somali would be the second leader of al Qaeda or Taliban leader murdered since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jallov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area, and three other high-ranking agents.
The pace of unmanned CIA-led aircraft attacks has decreased since summer, from an average of approximately six operations per month to two, according to a Long War Journal account, a website run by a non-profit organization.
The decrease is perhaps due to an improved tactic by terrorist groups, which have taken steps to limit their vulnerability while ruthlessly murdering suspected informants, the site stated.
UN peak in Kabul about to resign
The highest United Nations envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would give up his post in March, ending with a tumultuous mandate that was damaged by accusations of widespread corruption in Afghanistan's presidential election backed by the UN.
Eide's exit happens when the Obama administration has decided to send about 30,000 additional U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said he supports the increase, but he is concerned that the U.S. timeline for the military retreat that starts in 18 months drives other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the preparation of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to Afghans so that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be in the long term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressured the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian officials, who collaborate with Afghanistan ' s political transition.
The increase in the military sector has to be reflected in the civilian sector, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning, but simply fulfilling a promise he made to his family in March 2008, to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to notify the Secretary
UN General Ban Ki-moon, so I had time to find a replacement.
What I've said is that it's best that they start looking for a successor, Eide said.
When I got here, there was a two-month gap between my predecessor's departure and my arrival.
Ban has begun to seek a replacement, according to UN officials.
Officials say they have been considering Staffan di Mistura, a Swedish-Italian citizen who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led UN peace missions.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was tested before his former delegate, Peter W. Galbraith, who accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the country's presidential vote and covering evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied the incriminations, but said that Galbraith's accusations, who was fired, -it certainly harmed the mission, because there was already a lot of scepticism about international interference - in the election.
Eide said he proposed the appointment of a high civilian representative to coordinate assistance efforts by United States-led forces in Afghanistan.
It also promoted the leadership of the UN to allow its successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries, who lend themselves to the Afghan mission, claiming that this would increase their confidence that their money is being used properly.
Eide expressed frustration at the limitations on his powers in Afghanistan, arguing that the cumbersome UN recruitment regulations undermined his ability to capture talents.
This is how the UN rules allowed me to recruit only one person since May, he said.
That's catastrophic and can't go on.
Gates: Iran will face additional sanctions
The Secretary of Defense, Robert M. Gates, said on Friday that the world powers will soon impose significant additional sanctions against Iran for their failure to engage in talks about their nuclear ambitions.
Gates, addressing a group of approximately 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq, during a one-week war-zone trip to Afghanistan and Iraq, remained important in the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There are no good options in Iran, he held, in response to a soldier's question about the probability of such an event.
One of the things that weighs me is that if we've learned something from Iraq over the past six years, it's the inherent unpredictability of war.
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions for Iran's military and political elite, but Gates pointed out that some sanctions could also affect the Iranian population in general.
He argued that it would be necessary - a package of incentives and disincentives - - to persuade the Iranian government that they would really be less secure with nuclear weapons - because - their people will suffer enormously - sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by the spokesperson for the White House, Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders to warn that Iran will face - credible - consequences if its nuclear programme does not fully respect the indications of the UN Security Council and its nuclear control body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop nuclear knowledge for peaceful purposes only.
In talks in Geneva on 1 October, he indicated that he would negotiate again on the restriction of his nuclear programme and would agree to leave a substantial part of his enriched uranium reserve, in exchange for the fuel that is desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pressed for this agreement, as a way to build trust between the two parties and make time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran seems to have turned away from the tempting agreements, in part, say the experts, because Iranian command is divided in relation to the possibility of engaging with the United States.
Frankly, I believe that Iran's hardening with the international community on some proposals that actually accepted in early October, has joined the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, in a way that has not been in terms of additional significant sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama set a deadline on 31 December for Iran to respond to the proposals, before rethinking other options, even to continue with what Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton once called - devastating sanctions -
In a statement made in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what it called Thursday - baseless and baseless accusations - from some members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities, and said it was willing to continue discussions with the United States and five other world powers, in order to achieve an appropriate, long-term solution -
Gates, who was to return to Washington last Friday, met in the morning with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki before flying to the Kurdish oil-rich Iraq region to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions remain high between the Kurds and the Arab majority of Iraq, in particular with regard to borders, property rights and participation.
Gates urged both parties to reduce the potential for conflict, to avoid any delay in United States projects, to reduce the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to alleviate Kurdish anxiety about the pending reduction. U.S. officials quoted Gates' words to Massoud Barzani, the President of the Kurdistan Regional Government: \"We will preserve their security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq.
We won't abandon them.
In an aging China, a change of course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that preached them about the fact that - Mother Earth is too tired to sustain more children - and - one more baby means one more tomb -
They learned the lesson so well that when Shanghai government officials, alarmed by the low birth rate and the ageing population of their city, suddenly changed their course this summer and started encouraging young couples to have more than one child, their reaction was instant and firm: no way.
We've already given all our time and energy just for a child.
We have nothing left for a second, Wang said, 31-year-old, a human resources administrator with an 8-month-old child.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the policy of a single child in China, creating two generations of notoriously resonant children, single children, affectionately nicknamed, little emperors, a demographic crisis is emerging in the country.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per pair, compared to six children when the policy was implemented, according to the Division.
The UN demographics, while the number of residents aged 60 and over is expected to explode from 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 3.1 per cent by 2050, is well above the overall average of approximately 20 per cent.
The imbalance is worse in rich coastal cities with very cultured populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for almost 22 percent of Shanghai's registered residents, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of Shanghai's Family Planning and Municipal Population Commission, has stated that fertile couples should have babies to help reduce the proportion of the aged population and mitigate a future shortage of labour -
Shanghai is about to be - as old (not as rich, however) as developed countries like Japan and Sweden, he said.
A gradual relief
Written in the constitution of the country in 1978, the policy of a single son of China is possibly the most controversial mandate introduced to date by the Communist Party.
Couples who violate politics face enormous fines, up to three times their annual salary in some areas, and discrimination in the workplace.
Chinese officials have endorsed the policy for their contribution to avoid critical pressure on their natural resources, while human rights defenders have denounced abuses in the imposition of policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women with a second child to undergo abortions.
In addition, many couples have had abortions according to the sex of the fetus, leading to a high unnatural male-feet ratio.
In recent years, demographic officials have gradually softened their stance on single-child policy.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule, including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife are single children, and in 2007 they ate many of their hardline slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute for Demographic Research at the University of Beijing, said that central government officials have recently been discussing even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one spouse is a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost in the morning, the posters that commanded families to have only one child were replaced by copies of regulations detailing who would be suitable for having a second child and how to apply for a permit.
The city government sent family planning officials and volunteers to visit couples in their homes and slide leaflets under the doors.
It has also promised to provide emotional and financial guidance to those who have chosen to have more than one child.
Family planning officials say that the response has been very low.
Answer Disappointing
Although officials from a rural city on the outskirts of Shanghai argue that they have observed a moderate increase in the demands of couples who want a second child after the launch of the campaign, the most urban districts indicate no change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, is still receiving only four to five applications per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that, despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to reach only about 165,000, slightly higher than in 2009, but less than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of the municipality Caolu in Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason many people do not want more children.
They want to give their first child the best, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years old, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally empowered to do so.
But like many Chinese, they only have insufficient health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a social protection network, they argue, that option would be irresponsible.
People in the West incorrectly view single-child policy as a matter of rights, Yang said, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the first child of the couple.
Yes, we're being robbed of the possibility of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just a political issue.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their doubts.
Wang, the human resource manager, said he wants a single child because she was also: “We were the center of our families and we were used to having everyone take care of us.
We are not used to caring for others and we really don't want to take care of others.\"
Chen Zijian, 42, owner of a translation agency, explained it in a more powerful way.
For parents with two middle-class careers, who reduce the birth rate, he said, it is about being successful enough to be selfish.
People between the ages of 20 and 30 grew up seeing their parents' struggle during the first days of China's experiment with capitalism and they don't want that kind of life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child takes a long time from the parents, he held.
A mother has to give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are space issues, - you have to remodel your apartment - and the strategic - you have to have a curriculum prepared for the best daycare centers when the child is 9 months old -
Most of his friends are willing to face this once, Chen said, but not two.
Ours is the first generation with the highest standard of living, he expressed.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
A UN group outlines a plan to reduce emissions
The UN-sponsored climate conference, so far characterized by challenging positions and mutual recriminations, caught renewed attention on Friday with the dissemination of a document that foresees ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations carrying most of the burden on their shoulders in the short term.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles and highlighted the way forward.
But it was seen as an important step forward in a negotiations that are running out of time, with over 100 world leaders coming to Copenhagen next week.
Developed by an ad hoc UN working group, the text does not talk about how much money the rich countries would give to the poor to face global warming in the short and long term.
And this offers a variety of options for key questions, including how developed economies and major emerging economies would cut their coal production, and what would be the limit to the overall increase in the temperature that political strategies would be willing to tolerate.
This gives the process a lot of flexibility, said John Coequyt, high representative in Washington for the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who wrote the six-page document, summarized a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the UN's maximum climate officer, Yvo de Boer, described as - the big picture -
It shows the profiles for a possible agreement, in which industrialized nations collectively cut their emissions by 2020 by between 25 and 45 per cent, compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries would reduce their emissions during the same period by 15 to 30 per cent.
Together, the countries would cut emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union also encouraged talks on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion annually over the next three years, to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change, from floods and droughts to deforestation.
Anyway, Friday was the same kind of verbal fireworks that dominated the talks last week.
The United States Special Climate Envoy, Todd Stern, rejected claims that require mandatory greenhouse gas emissions reductions for industrialized countries, compared with volunteers from major emerging economies, if not funded by the developed world.
The maneuver indicated that the Obama administration is adopting a tougher line with China, with respect to what Bush administration officials did just two years ago.
The United States is not going to make an agreement without the major developing countries moving forward and taking action, said Stern, who also regretted that the text did not do enough to ensure that cuts could be verified by external observers.
Stern commented an hour after the Chinese Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs He Yafei stated that the greatest climate negotiator in the United States lacked, or was, very irresponsible because he had said earlier in the week that the United States would not help China economically to cope with global warming.
With the future economic trajectory of the world's major powers at stake, the fault lines have erupted both within the developing world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The present battle is both to save individual economies and to save the planet, with China and the United States facing their respective obligations, while the poorest nations insist that the twenty-four most influential countries in the world are ignoring the scientific imperative to take the most courageous action.
Ricardo Ulate, a Costa Rican delegate, said it is not surprising that the main powers are discussing who should cost the costs to limit greenhouse gases, even though the vulnerable countries have become more aggressive in their efforts to contain the major issuers responsible for their actions.
This is clearly a game where a new economic hegemony is being developed, said Ulate, who also works as a regional adviser on climate change in Mexico and Central America for International Conservation.
Some of the most vulnerable countries to the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to press for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the main participants said that the talks would produce a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which has 43 members, developed a proposal for a 24-page preliminary treaty early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said that the push of small island nations has, in part, put political pressure on the whole political process, because they are now unified and require the action of emerging economies, such as China and India.
The talks took on a new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that they had to resolve most of the outstanding issues before the heads of government came to a close.
High-level officials, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Deputy Minister, came down from the planes and ran to the Bella Center corridors, closed-door meetings and press conferences, so that they could delineate the claims that will be made during the next week.
The absolute disorder of the meeting (where every day 13,000 people enter and leave the convention center, the activists who play the guitar present night shows mocking the countries that they think are selling, and hand-to-hand proposals are passed instead of via mail), poses a challenge.
The intensity only builds: almost all key ministers are here right now, and on Wednesday 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the major leagues, said Carlos Manuel Rodríguez, vice-president for the global policy of International Conservation.
Heavy weights are coming.
The first train 225 km from Britain redefines that feeling of Monday
At 5.13 a.m. on Monday morning, a whistle will pierce the darkness to point out a train exit that marks a revolution for travel in Britain.
The first high-speed interurban train in the country will reach 225 km/h, as it passes as a beam from Ashford, Kent, to St Panrcas station in London, covering 93 kilometres in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Secretary of Transportation, will then join Lady Kelly Holmes on board the first interurban service Javelin outside London.
He hopes that the new service will finally connect Britain to an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the great conurbations of the Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
The neglected remote areas would become prosperous suburbs, business travel times would be cut short, and changing planes and cars to the railway would reduce national coal emissions, as well as ease congestion on roads.
In theory, the three main political parties believe in this vision.
But the tens of billions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable battle of planning and fears of environmental damage, can still stop Britain's high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide the Government with a feasibility study, will deliver its report to Lord Adonis on 30 December, as the Times said.
This will provide you with a detailed itinerary of the next stage planned for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the Midlands of the West will be drawn within a five-metre radius in urban areas and areas where the environmental impact can be controversial.
In rural areas, the plan will be drawn within 25 metres of a final route.
HS2 is also expected to set three options for a wider high-speed network heading north.
Lord Adonis will answer in spring.
The preferred option being proposed is a Y-shaped configuration, in which a single high-speed line would reach the Midlands of the West.
The line would be divided into or near Birmingham, with a branch heading west from the Peninos to Manchester and Scotland, and another to the northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would enter Scotland.
“This seems to be the most beneficial option,” said one railway member.
Once completed, travel times between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first stage, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to just over an hour.
The proposals would allow trains to travel at 402 km/h, turning the British network into the fastest in Europe.
The initial route is being designed to support 400 mt long trains, capable of transporting 1,100 people.
At least 18 trains could operate every hour on a London-Birmingham line.
This means that a London terminal would be needed capable of receiving 20,000 passengers per hour.
Considering the restrictions on the capital's space, an existing station is expected to be expanded to fit the high-speed network.
Railway industry experts argue that only St Pancras International or Euston station offer that potential.
Lord Adonis will announce if he believes that the scheme should proceed, but a broad public consultation and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be made until after a general election.
Even if the work was started, the network would have to be built in sections.
At first, trains would be forced to leave the fast lines along the existing lanes north of Birmingham, keeping travel times between London and Scotland above three hours.
This is considered to be the crucial point needed to ensure a change from aircraft to trains, a reference point for the rail revolution.
The taxpayers face the mortgage for a £75,000 orange from a Conservative
Alan Duncan, the vocalist of the Conservative Party, paid the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of a orange tree that he built in the house of his electoral district.
The party's prison spokesman, who was degraded by David Cameron for complaining that the MPs lived - of rations - increased their mortgage by £75.000 to build an extension framed in oak in their second home in Rutland.
They allowed the taxpayer to charge the extra interest, adding hundreds of pounds a month.
The House of Commons authorities approved the applications at the time and have not been consulted by Sir Thomas Legg, who conducts a review of the expenses of the members. Last night Mr. Duncan said that the applications - could not be clearer or simpler -
Mr. Duncan, one of the richest Members of Parliament, has a two-storey house in a town in his electoral district of Rutland and Melton.
Nearby houses have been sold for almost a million pounds.
The ground floor comprises a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the fee office agreed that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year he added a greenhouse to the house, described in the planes as an orange.
The neighbors described him as - a greenhouse for entertainment -
Mr. Duncan was not asked to make any reference to the increase in the loan, during a recent investigation by the Committee on Standards and Privileges of the House of Commons on his previous mortgage agreements.
Last month the committee acquitted him of violating the rules, following an investigation of his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal guarantee for a mortgage of £271,406 of his London property to the house of his electoral district, which he had bought in 1991, the year before he became a deputy.
The documents released this week show that Mr. Duncan was requesting approximately £1,400 a month in mortgage interests until March last year.
In April, their applications increased to over £1,800 per month.
The interest rate of Mr Duncan's Royal Bank of Scotland's mortgage did not change at the time, suggesting that the entire increase would finance the loan of £75.000.
The standard variable Mortgage Type of the BRE dropped from 7.94% in December 2007, to 4% in March of this year, the type to which it is now found.
The most recent document issued by the House of Commons authorities shows that Mr Duncan was still requesting £1,250 per month in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his job as President of the House's opposition in September, after a covert reporter filmed him saying that the deputies had to survive, from rations, after the expense scandal.
\"Basically this is nationalized, you have to live on rations and be treated like m**rda\"
He said, \"I spend my money in my garden and I ask for a small fraction on the basis of what's appropriate.
And I could ask for a lot more, but I don't.
The Member, a millionaire for his former profession as an oil merchant, was first questioned about his expenses in May, when it turned out that he had requested thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the salary office that this - could be considered excessive -
An activist dug a hole in the shape of the sterling symbol in Mr. Duncan's lawn as a protest, after revealing that he requested £4,000 for three years.
Last night, when asked about the increase in the mortgage, Mr. Duncan said: “It was for primary improvements, approved by both the salary office and later Legg.”
He added: “It is not about circumventing and criminalizing or breaking the rules or whatever.
This is absolutely within the limits, according to the rules, authorized and all.
It could not be in any way clearer or simpler -
Come who have faith, to see the calendar of the Adventure of Brighton Beach Palapa
Brighton Palapas have found a new impetus for the winter months in an interactive Event calendar.
In addition, an alternative religious group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their palapas for every day of December, using villainics as their theme.
The event began on December 1, with guests who could see the last shovel from 17.30 to 18.30 every day, with stuffed cakes and punches served free of charge.
The villains chosen so far include Vi Tres Barcos, Oh Ven, Oh Ven, Emanuel and La Primera Navidad, where the palapa presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an unpaid clergyman of the diocese of Chichester and the leader of Beyond.
He said: \"We want religion to be more relevant to people, in a society of post-Christianism\"
“Why do we expect as a Church people to come to an old strange building? I think the Church should come to people and celebrate in exciting ways.
The idea of the Palapa Event calendar began as a conversation with some friends during a dinner.
Brighton is an incredibly creative and vibrant place and we're trying to prove and represent that through spirituality.
Massive climate mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world
Tens of thousands of protesters protested this Saturday in demand for an ambitious and binding agreement to fight global warming, all over the world and in Copenhagen, where the police arrested several hundred people.
Some 30,000 people, according to the police; hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, paraded by the icy Danish capital in claim of an agreement to be reached by the United Nations Conference on Climate Change by Friday, which would enter into force on 1 January 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish President of the Climate Conference, the growing climate mobilization around the world, represented by these demonstrations, contributed to the very high political price of a failure in Copenhagen.
The incidents broke out shortly after the outbreak of the demonstration in the Danish capital, when a group of 300 people, all dressed in black, broke escape with dolls and hammers, reported a journalist from the AFP.
The riot police intervened quickly and firmly.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 persons in total, according to it, they are especially members of the \"Black Blocks\" ultra-violent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, east of France, last April.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the organizers of the demonstration, denounced the conditions under which hundreds of militants were detained, stressing that a hundred of them - were immobilized on the street on Saturday night handcuffed and sat down despite the intense cold -
The demonstration, quite peaceful, came out of Parliament and took to the Bella Center, the headquarters of the negotiations.
Protesters stopped about 500 metres from the building without attempting to enter.
A setting was set up to welcome the guest speakers. Former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, headed a candle watch.
Most of the protesters arrived by bus and train from large European cities, but many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present as some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most of them with celestial pacifiers responded by forming a first concentration in the morning in Copenhagen to the call of Friends of the Earth to form - blue areas - by \"justice and climate -
Today we took the streets to ask for compensation for ecological debt in favour of the South, explained Lily Nacpil, a Philippine militant of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't keep saying, \"There's time,\" said the benign singer Angélique Kidjo.
In Africa, there are rivers that dry, watercourses that can be walked as never before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, created in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalization movement approached environmental organizations.
The French MEP José Bové, a figure of anti-globalization, explained that he came to Copenhagen to bring about climate justice and social justice: \"today the fight against global warming is not opposed to the struggle for another world.\"
The Asia Pacific region, which brings together many islands that are very vulnerable to warming, gave the initial peak to manifestations.
According to the organizers, some 50,000 people went to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, more than a hundred people, mostly students, paraded red dresses and glossing cloths with slogans in favor of solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, as well as in Canada, hundreds of protestors claimed to act vigorously against climate change were formed.
In France, the protests organized by the network -350 - brought together hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, tens of people were concentrated.
Separatist Abkhazia elected president, although Georgia denounces \"fraud\"
This Saturday Abkhazia, Georgia's pro-Russian separatist region recognized by Moscow more than a year ago, elected president; however, Tbilisi denounces \"fraud\"
Some 131,000 people were summoned to take part in the first election after the Russian-Georgian war in August 2008 by the control of South Ossetia, another Georgian separatist region recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 5 p.m. GMT.
According to the officials of the Abkhaz Electoral Commission, participation was 58% hours before closure.
The first provisional results would be announced on Saturday night to Sunday.
The five candidates in career, including outgoing President Sergei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which disapproved of voting.
These elections are a hoax.
On the other hand, Georgian President Mikheïl Saakachvili, — laments that Abkhazia fell under the full Russian occupation — declared his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladzé.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After his separation from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict that ended with several thousand dead, Abkhazia tries to prove by means of this election that she is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage of our new life, our new era as an independent state, declared to the AFP Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claimed to have voted in Bagapch.
She was among the electors who addressed the electoral table at a school in the capital, Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with palm trees at the entrance.
The theme of Russian domination is the central theme of the presidential election in this region with sumptuous landscapes, on the shores of the Black Sea.
Large tables show Bagapch next to the Russian President and Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, in different places in this small territory of 216,000 people.
In Gali, west of the country, the district chief, Beslan Archba, warmly welcomed the Russian leaders who came to control the development of scrutiny.
In a brief ceremony, he said: We, the people of Abkhazia, thank Moscow for the support, and particularly the decision to recognize the independence of Abkhazia.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, answered by raising his vodka vessel.
On the other hand, the opposition represented in the election by former Vice President Raoul Khadjimba and two entrepreneurs, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticizes the agreements signed with Moscow last year, such as the one that gives Russia control of the Abkhaz railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, contends that he does not support current power or opposition.
A majority of 50% more than one vote is needed to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round will be organized two weeks later.
Climate: events in the world, incidents in Copenhagen
On Saturday, tens of thousands of people went to the streets of the world to call for an ambitious and binding agreement before the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference, where the police, on alert, arrested more than 700 people around an impressive demonstration.
Some 30,000 people, according to the police; hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, paraded in the afternoon amid the cold of the Danish capital, which hosts delegates from 193 countries until 18 December, in search of an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
The peaceful demonstration came out of Parliament and took us to the Bella Center, where the negotiations are taking place.
The protesters stopped about 500 metres from the center, without trying to enter.
A setting was set up to welcome the guest speakers. Former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, headed a candle watch.
A few moments after the beginning of the demonstration, a group of hundreds of people, all dressed in black, broke escape with bricks and hammers, reported a journalist from the AFP.
The riot police quickly surrounded them and intervened firmly, throwing several of them on the floor.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 persons, stating that they were mostly members of the \"Black Blocks\" ultra-violent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, last April.
At the last hour of the afternoon, a police officer was injured in the jaw with an adokin, and four cars were burned near an occupied house during the incidents that led to arrest of about 20 people, according to the police.
The extremist groups do not take our eyes off them, they prevent the police spokesman, Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the law enforcement forces fly over the area.
Most of the protesters, who arrived by bus and by train from the large cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam, even Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present like some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most of them with celestial pacifiers responded by forming a first concentration in the morning in Copenhagen to the call of Friends of the Earth to form - blue areas - by \"justice and climate -

The Asia Pacific region, which brings together many islands that are very vulnerable to warming, gave the initial peak to manifestations.
According to the organizers, some 5,000 people went to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, hundreds of people, mostly students, manifested red dresses and glossing cloths with slogans in favor of solar energy in front of the Philippine capital town hall.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, hundreds of protestors claimed to act against climate change were formed.

The subject of history and geography is reinforced by the reform of secondary education, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education, Luc Chatel, stated in an interview that will be transmitted in the Informational of Sunday (JDD, according to his French acronym) that history and geography would emerge from the reform of general secondary education, despite being eliminated from compulsory education in the second year of scientific bachelor's degree.
From now on, all students in the first bachelor's degree will have four hours a week and the same program for a shared common culture, says Chatel.
For the Minister, \"compared with hypocrisy,\" he said, \"the C branch is no longer a scientific branch\" but \"generally calls on the best students\"
The branches Teaching General and Literary cannot be sublime from the C, it goes on to underline even: -I did not hear that historians or intellectuals were outraged by having eliminated history and geography in the second degree of bachelor's degree in technological schools -
An IFOP survey published on Saturday in L'Humanité revealed that approximately seven French people of ten (69%) disapproved of the government project to eliminate the compulsory teaching of history-geography in second grade C. Numerous intellectuals and teachers, the left and some elected right-wing representatives also criticized this fact.
On the other hand, the Minister added that \"it is not spoken\" of eliminating philosophy from the second bachelor's programme C.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) called on a day of mobilization on Tuesday to protest against the project, which, according to them, sacrificed the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), at the beginning of the year, they will give an admission test that will aim for their discipline, and at the end of the year, a admission test on their ability to teach, the Minister explained.
They will also practice in real conditions during the year of M2, then will be a first year in front of the classroom as teachers in practice.
If you do all the proposed practices prior to the contest, you will already have a great experience in front of the classroom, that is, more than 300 hours, added.
Finally, the Minister points out that he will propose - the individual right to training, which does not exist in national education -
It also confirmed the project to eliminate the school map - before 2012 -
At the High School, experts will have 15 minutes to convincingly explain the evolution of climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about the challenges of the Copenhagen Summit, which took place on Saturday morning Jean Jouzel, vice-president of the Intergovernmental Panel of Experts on Climate Change (IGEC) invited by the Ulm Street School of Normal Superior.
Jean Jouzel, also a Nobel Peace Prize, opened the conference wheel - Ernst - a day consisting of a series of fifteen-minute expert presentations, filmed and opened to the public, reported a journalist from the AFP.
We wanted to do something that would attract people and give them a desire to know more, he explained in the framework of the 22-year-old Edouard Hannezzo conference, one of the organizers of this day called as the students baptized the fish of the school pond.
We selected about twenty participants among the experts of their discipline and selected them on their charismatic side, he specified.
About global warming, - we can talk hours, but we can also talk about key objectives in a few minutes - he told AFP Jean Jouzel, who I expose without notes, but with the help of graphics against about fifty people.
It is part of our scientific role, he stressed that the public should understand that the Copenhagen conference is based on a very serious scientific record.
The videos filmed during those conferences will be online on the school's website from 15 December.
It is scheduled for February for the next \"Ernest\" day, followed by others at a bimonthly pace.
Delay in payments: Disgrace among prison guards, it is planned to take action
The prison guard unions called on a \"general mobility\" on Friday to demand payment before the end-of-year parties, premiums and overtime, which was postponed until January for budgetary reasons.
The Prison Labour Force (2nd union of guards) called on the personnel out of service to join the demonstration on Tuesday morning in front of the prisons and - block them - in order to denounce the theft of their assets.
The prison CGT (3rd trade union of the profession) summons them to - gather in general assemblies in the different prisons to achieve massive mobilization - since tyld of - shameful and unacceptable - the non-payment in December of - overtime, night premiums, Sundays and holidays - worked in October.
And the first union of guards, the Federal Autonomous Penitentiary Union (Ufap/Unsa), - calls for the general mobilization (...) in order to increase discontent and anger -
The Penitentiary Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that the overtime increased significantly in 2009 and not all were accounted for, but they ensure that the balance will be paid in January.
At the last hour of the day, the Chancellorship reported that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the guards' unions ensuring that the payment would be made next month.
I do not doubt the efforts made by the staff for the operation and modernization of our prison system, the Minister of Justice writes in this letter.
I call on the Directorate of the Penitentiary Administration to immediately implement a set of measures to ensure that this situation generated by a poor evaluation of the number of overtime does not occur in the future.
The December pay will then be scarce, except for the management staff who enjoy the benefit of the famous bonuses for functions and objectives, and who - always blames the budget requirements - deplored the Ufap/Unsa.
It is a real scandal, said the interregional union FO de Marseille, announcing its decision to boycott up to new order - all meetings and convocations -
Staff will not come to work on the corresponding Sundays and holidays if the October days are not paid in December, the same will happen with the overtime, also threatening FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At the time of increasing our tasks and missions without taking more effective action, it is more than regrettable to dare to attack the salary of the staff, according to the Prison CGT of Bordeaux.
According to the unions, not in all regions is the same, as some are more fortunate than others.
But anyway, the result is not the expected one, said Secretary General of the Ufap, Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says he does - better gifts - than the ones he receives
U.S. President Barack Obama, who will celebrate his first family Christmas at the White House, confessed to the famous television presenter Oprah Winfrey, who came to a simple conclusion on gifts: \"I make better gifts than the ones I receive.\"
During a special interview that the ABC chain will issue on Sunday night, the President and his wife Michelle explain how they plan to celebrate the end-of-year parties in their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, the family's little four-legged companion, will be in the game.
Santa also loves Bo, said Michelle Obama, clarifying that the dog will, of course, receive a gift, according to the extracts of the program transmitted in advance.
And Michelle Obama disagreed with her husband's assertions about the quality of the gifts she received: \"No way, last year, I made you beautiful gifts,\" she said provoking the president.
True, he was forced to admit it before responding with humor, pointing to the pearl necklace of the First Lady: \"Who gave you that?\"
During the one-hour interview, in a relaxed atmosphere with the famous cheerleader who had devotedly supported Barack Obama's presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favorite children's gifts.
Barack Obama recalled a two-speed bike, as well as a basketball that his Kenyan father, who he saw rarely gave him for Christmas.
I remember that time when my father came to see us at Christmas and gave me a basketball, the President said.
Only many years later, I learned that he had given me that ball.
For her part, the First Lady remembered her dollhouse.
I had no idea how to organize a house, so I put all the furniture online against the wall, rather than accommodate them around the house, however, I loved that dollhouse, said Michelle Obama.

According to RTL, sponsor of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday agreed, however, to be subjected to an induced coma to avoid - pain and complications -
In less than 48 hours when the patient wakes up, we will be more sure about his state, add RTL.
The press service, questioned by the AFP, did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also states that, according to some sources, no cannula would have been introduced after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated at the international clinic of Monceau Park due to a disc hernia.
The intervention, scheduled for a few days, was practiced by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known physician in the artistic environment.
On Thursday night, Delajoux refused to comment on the information transmitted by RTL.
singer Johnny Hollyday joined the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles on Monday for an infection derived from the intervention carried out by Delajeux.

Euro-2009/Short Piscina: first title of Bousquet in your favorite distance
The French Frédérick Bousquet, a three-star long pool medalist in the Worlds-2009, obtained an international title on Thursday in a distance where he feels particularly affected, 50 m free, during Euro-2009 in short swimming pool in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition in which polyurethane bathers were allowed for the last time, only three world records were exceeded when many more were actually expected.
One was improved by Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto in 200 m 4 styles; and the other two, by Russian in relief 4 x 50 m 4 styles (masculine).
A penalty for Bousquet, which coveted the world record in 50 m free, a brand that has a long pool (20.94).
In one of the two reigning distances of swimming, in 50 m free, the 28-year-old Frenchman was imposed with 20'''53 during a final where ten swimmers competed instead of eight as usual, a first at the international level.
Bousquet advanced to Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but failed to lower the world brand (20.30), as planned.
We can always aspire to something better and, in that case, I already said that if the world record was within my reach, I would try to achieve it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers wore polyurethane bathers which from 1 January will be prohibited.
These bathers, the origin of 238 world records since February 2008, end their epic in Istanbul, where they first competed in 1999 for the same test.
This time the use of bathers did not help the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in long swimming pool this summer in Rome, consecutive world records.
The young swimmer did not manage to lower his mark in 400 m free (3:32.77), however, he imposed himself with the second best time of his career (3:34.55), before the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't give myself up in this career.
I knew I wasn't going to be able to beat a world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and accomplish my mission.
Lobintsev will be a tough rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
US: a sarcophagus panel that belonged to Zola sold in USD 1.5 million
A Roman sarcophagus panel that belonged to French writer Emile Zola was sold on Thursday in $1.5 million, far above the estimated price, announced Sotheby's art dealer.
This panel of 2 meters long for 63 cm high, date of the third century after Christ, and its price was estimated to be between 150,000 and 250,000 dollars.
The marble, which represents four dionysian scenes, in a sophisticated architectural framework, surrounded by satirians and drunken women, is an uncommon piece, since there are only four or five in the world, explained on Tuesday to AFP Florent Heintz, vice president of art auctions of ancient Rome and Egypt in Sotheby's.
It was sold in a hundred lots.
The sale continues, but so far, this lot was the highest raised by buyers, no doubt, pointed out to the AFP a spokesperson of Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy.
Only a few days ago, it was found that marble was an acquisition of Emile Zola.
For almost 300 years, the panel became part of the famous Borges family collection in Rome, then appeared successively in the house of the French actress Cécile Sorel, as an element of his wand in his particular Parisian mansion, and in the house of Paul Raynaud, Minister of the Third French Republic and President of the Council for a short time, before the Marshal Pétain took power.
For some fifty years, his whereabouts were uncertain.
Reviewing the Louvre Museum database, Florent Heintz found that this panel was part of an \"Emile Zola Succession\" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of \"Thérèse Raquin\" and the fresco of the \"Rougon-Macquart\"
Honduras aborted the exit from Zelaya to Mexico
On Thursday, Mexico estimated that the conditions were not given to move to its territory to the overthrown President of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, whom the coup government denied the safe conduct.
For the moment, after a telephone conversation at night with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that there is no possibility of the transfer, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
The Mexican government plane that arrived on Wednesday in El Salvador to take Zelaya, returned to its place of origin, according to a source of the Directorate-General for Migration.
To grant him a safe conduct, the coup government wanted to force Zelaya to \"give up\" and to ask for political asylum abroad.
But the defeated president refused because he wanted to get to Mexico as head of State in guest service.
The coup government - suffered a new defeat by asking me to give up my office (...), they wanted me to introduce my resignation - said Zelaya on Thursday on radio Globo, in which he has often made statements since the beginning of the political crisis that has been five months in the country of Central America.
Here I can stay ten years, I have my guitar, he added playing some chords the president deposed, refugee at the embassy of Brazil of Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Mexican embassy presented us with a request for safe conduct, but unfortunately we could not accept it because it did not contain a request for asylum, said on Wednesday the Minister of the Interior of the Definitive Government, Oscar Raúl Matute, to Honduran Radio HRN.
I will not ask for asylum from any country, Manuel Zelaya replied in an interview in the Telesur chain, whose headquarters is located in Caracas.
If I leave Honduras, I will do so as president of the Honduran people, he underlined.
The rumors about Zelaya’s departure mobilized Wednesday to the supporters of the deposed president, who gathered around the Brazilian embassy, heavily besieged by the military.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the position of the coup government.
This reflects the marginal nature of this government in the face of international standards, he estimated.
Zelaya, who had approached Venezuela's socialist president, Hugo Chávez, was overthrown on 28 June, the day when he had organized a referendum to prepare his re-election, rejected by the Supreme Court, the army and the Congress.
Since his exile in Costa Rica, he returned surprisingly on 21 September and took refuge in the embassy of Brazil.
If he leaves, he will be arrested and will have to answer to the Justice for the crime of “high treason” according to the coup government.
The de facto president, Roberto Micheletti, managed to hold a presidential election on 29 November to replace Zelaya.
In the controversial scrutiny, Porfirio Lobo was elected. That election was recognized by the United States, but questioned by countries in Latin America, such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted massively against Zelaya's return to power until his term of office ended on 27 January.

The United States trade deficit fell by 7.6 per cent in October compared with September, to $32.9 billion.
The analysts expected, on the contrary, a deepening of the deficit.
Both imports and exports increased.
The great novelty is the growth of trade volumes, in particular exports of goods, reflecting the growth of major economies trading with the United States, said Christopher Cornell of the research company Economy.com.
On the other hand, last week, unemployment registrations in the United States unexpectedly increased, 474,000 applications were submitted.
But in the last four weeks, the average number of new job applicants - it has been the lowest in the last year - underlined Scott Marcouiller, of Wells Fargo Advisors.

Cuba: more than a hundred supporters of power are abuking the Ladies of Blanco
On Thursday, hundreds of Cuban supporters of power seized the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for the world day of human rights and prevented another demonstration to which a dozen dissidents were summoned.
Some 40 - Ladies of White - wives or relatives of political prisoners, were attacked on the street by supporters of the government of Raúl Castro as they walked to the center of the capital claiming the release of those detainees, held a journalist of the AFP.
The Yankees died!, \"Mercenarias,\" \"The street belongs to the revolutionaries, \"Live Fidel and Raúl\" ran with the upper hand of the militants of power to the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by agents dressed as civilians who came to - protect them -
On the eve, a similar demonstration erupted against the \"La Damas de Blanco\" in Havana, with no injuries or arrests.
But in the Habanero district of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also rushing to manifest themselves on Thursday for the international human rights day, was arrested by police officers dressed as civilians, a journalist from AFP reported.
The agents forcibly climbed the vehicles to the dissidents who were beaten by supporters of the government, according to that journalist.
In general, the arrest of dissidents in similar circumstances only takes a few hours.
The \"Lamas de Blanco\" awarded the 2005 Sajarov Prize granted by the European Parliament had organized an unauthorized march to \"request the release of all political prisoners\" about 200 according to the dissent, declared one of its leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband, Héctor Maceda, is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Maceda is part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents imprisoned in March 2003, of which 53 are still behind bars.
Cuban authorities call on opponents of “mercenaries” or “agents” to pay their declared enemy, the United States.
Rarely in the media, Cuban television reported on the demonstration on Thursday of the government militants against the - counter-revolutionaries -
Cuba, ruled by a single party, the Communist Party, is constantly accused by European or American NGOs of trampling on rights and freedoms, especially those of expression.

Following the serious injuries, the man born in 1929 died in the hospital, according to a police union leader Alliance.
Later in the pharmacy or in front of it, he attacked a pregnant woman who was with her partner.
The husband, some 30 years old, was arrested and wounded.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were taken to the hospital where the old man died.
The life of the other injured, with the vital organs apparently affected, is in danger.
Then the pregnant woman fainted and was hospitalized — in a state of shock — reported a police source.
The armed man, who seemed to be under the effects of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would have escaped by the boulevard Jean Jaurès.
Apparently at random, he would have injured two more pedestrians: one thirty-year-old man, and another forty seriously.
At night, the crime scene was still unclear.
He was armed with two butcher knives that had crossed his back, explained in the place a union leader Alliance in the Highs of the Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passers-bys, including young people, tried to control the deer, according to the testimonies obtained by the AFP.
I saw a guy about thirty years old with a green jacket.
Three young men tried to intercept him.
They didn't get it because the guy was strong, explained Alberto, waiter at a nearby bar.

The Nanterre Prosecutor ' s Office submitted the investigation to the jurisdiction of the Departmental Service of the Upper Sena Judicial Police (SDPJ 92).
The madman was hospitalized on Thursday night.
During his temporary detention he has not said a word.
A police source does not rule out the possibility of interning him in a psychiatric hospital.

US: Polanski's lawyer again demands that the case be dismissed
The French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski's lawyer once again claimed this Thursday in Los Angeles (California, West United States), that the case against his client, who is under house arrest in Switzerland, is dismissed for a sexual abuse case that occurred more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, lawyer of the director of \"The Pianist\", denounced serious procedural errors at the time of the events in 1977 before three judges of the Appeals Chamber of the Second District of California.
Hummel stated: I claim that at this very moment the charges are dismissed, since the judge's conduct in charge of the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, - it was creepy -
According to him, Judge Rittenband (died since) would have spoken to a prosecutor who would have told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison, before sentencing, which constitutes a serious lack of procedure.
This conversation was made public in the documentary (Roman Polanski: wanted and desired) (Roman Polanski, wanted and wanted), of the prosecutor's own mouth in question, David Wells.
But ultimately Wells declared in late September - he had lied - to the author of the documentary.
Hummel claimed the holding of a trial that would allow him to present the evidence of his argument in case the court refused to dismiss the case.
The prosecution, for its part, reiterated the argument put forward at first instance, that there could be no serious assessment of any dismissal of the charges as Roman Polanski did not appear before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978 before a 13-year-old under-law sentence was issued.
Since then, he has never stepped back on the United States.
District Vice-Fiscal of Los Angeles, Phyllis Asayama, stated that Roman Polanski - has to be here to appear at the hearing -
With this cause, we want to convey the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused, that there is the possibility of fleeing?, Asayama asked.
For her, the filmmaker, a favor to the court, even though he despises his authority,
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to pronounce his sentence, also stressed - that there were other alternatives to the decision to flee -
Hummel was not the only one who asked to dismiss the case against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer's lawyer, the victim, also claimed, once again, to close the case.
He submits that his client no longer supports harassing her every time the Polanski case comes up, and adds: \"No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years, that's enough.
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland by order of U.S. arrest.
After more than two months behind bars, he was sentenced to house arrest in his Gstaad hut, pending extradition.
Wall Street loses its course and slows down by the rise of the dollar
The New York Stock Exchange closed this weekend, in a market that is debated between indicators better than those predicted in the United States and the rise of the dollar: the Dow Jones won 0.63%, but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final figures at the closing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 65.67 points to 10,471,50 points, while the Nasdaq, a technological component, lost 0.55 points to be located in 2,190.31 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index advanced by 0.37% (4.06 points), reaching 1,106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver, of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains with narrow margins, the volume of exchanges is getting smaller and I think it will be kept this way by the end of the year.
The trend was maintained through the publication of better economic indicators than expected, which helped to improve market opinion in terms of the robustness of economic reactivation, summed up the analysts of Charles Schwab.
In the United States, retail sales increased 1.3 per cent in November per second consecutive month and higher than expected.
In addition, U.S. consumers’ confidence was clearly recovered in December, 73.4 versus 67.4 the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index.
However, the indexes were slowed down by a further advance of the dollar which reached the highest level of the last two months in front of the euro, leading to a drop in sectors sensitive to the economic situation, Owen Fitzpatrick, of the Deutsche Bank.
In this way, technological values lost ground.
The bond market fell.
Ten-year Treasury bond performance amounted to 3.540 per cent versus 3.482 per cent on Wednesday night, and bond yield to 4.497 per cent at 30 years compared to 4.492 per cent on day.
The election of Miss World again in South Africa
After a month of tour in South Africa, the 112 candidates for Miss World's title are on the final line to fulfill their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion spectators.
During this great celebration of the beauty organized for the second consecutive year in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them already achieved their participation in the semifinal.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gibraltar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were elected Miss Deportista or, even, Miss Top Model during their stay in Africa.
It was a real review.
It was extraordinary to visit beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town.
I saw a lot of things and I lived countless experiences!, said amazed Miss Sierra Leone.
This contest, which is held for the ninth time in South Africa, will be transmitted on a live Saturday from Midrand to North Johannesburg, from 5:00 p.m. (15 h GMT).
Impossible to imagine a better country to deliver my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I am very glad to have lived twice, says Miss Mundo Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian woman, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with the candidates and by the possibility of rediscovering - African landscapes that take away the breath -
After a month of galas, essays, press wheels and safaris, the candidates for Miss Mundo focus on the contest.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow the steps of Priyanka Chopra, winner in 2000 and present in this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both converted into Bollywood stars.
Every woman's dream is to be crowned as the most beautiful in the world, but it's not just about appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries, and I want to return to my country with the crown, declares Miss India with a great smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will mark this 59th edition.
The candidates will parade in traditional dresses and, of course, with a bather.
Chinese presenter Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean, and a Miss Mundo committee leader, Steve Douglas, will lead the event.
South Africa proved able to receive the world with warmth and pride difficult to match, says Julia Morley, president of Miss Mundo.
Like last year, the candidates made a safari, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time by bicycle, and tasted the local cuisine.
As an exceptional fact, they met South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook their hands.
Something unusual for a head of state, notes Miss Sierra Leone.
His best memory will undoubtedly be the draw in Cape Town (Southwest) for the June 2010 Football World, a way for the country to further promote the event.
I've been dealing with people I've never thought to get to know.
He's probably back to the 2010 World Cup, Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi, says enthusiastic.
News about Johnny Hallyday - are very positive - according to his son David
News about Johnny Hallyday - are very positive - assured his son David on Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles airport to accompany his hospitalized father for several days.
The news is very positive.
Dad is strong and everything is coming out very well, told the press David Hallyday when he came down from the plane that brought him from Paris shortly after local time (21 h GMT).
The son of the singer, distended, assured that he would move, as before, to the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday entered Monday for an infection derived from the hernia discal operation on November 26 in Paris.
The musician is, since that night's lead in Los Angeles for comfort reasons, to prevent him from suffering and thus being able to manage his treatment, he indicated the press service.
Johnny Hallyday had already been subjected to a coma induced by doctors at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where he entered the Monday for an infection, the sequel to a hernia discal operation on 26 November last in Paris.
The singer was once again operated on Wednesday night to Thursday due to serious injuries caused by the previous intervention.
His wife, Laetitia, was at the French High School in Los Angeles on Friday morning, attended by his daughter Jade, to witness a school act, confirmed a photographer of the AFP.
The head of Orthopedic Surgery and Traumatology at the Pitié-Salpêtrie hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would travel on Monday to Los Angeles to be with the singer.
The producer violently accused Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated on the singer on 26 November at the international private clinic at Monceau Park in Paris.
They told us it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were outraged, Camus declared.
We're talking about a possible lawsuit, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus argued that Johnny Hallyday had — traveled too quickly to Los Angeles with the permission of the Parisian surgeon —
I spoke directly to the doctor and was surprised when he assured me that there was no problem in making the trip, since I was operated twice as a hernia discal, he added.
Earlier in the RTL station, he indicated that the singer appeared to have gone, without a canal, without anything, after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic environment.
He operated on actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before his death, at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where Delajeux was working at the time.
In 2007, actress Charlotte Gainsbourg was also involved in reabsorbing a hematoma formed as a result of brain hemorrhage.
He is a doctor with a bad reputation, convicted of justice on several occasions for malapaxis, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, lawyer of the Order of Doctors, accused him of being - a man without scruples - sued - regularly - before the Council of the Order, and is - far from recommended -
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
It indicated that the intervention - it was carried out without any inconvenience - and that the results of the postoperative studies were -normal -
The operation - it could not cause hemorrhage and therefore did not need drainage - added.
Anyway, the singer's tour, whose health problems have multiplied since summer, entered a parenthesis.
No doubt, to resume the tour on January 8 (in Amiens, NDLR) as planned, it seems to me very risky, said Camus.
The UDF Association raises the tone and warns the New Center about the use of its acronym
The UDF Association (Union for French Democracy), controlled by the MoDem (Democratic Movement) of François Bayrou, reacted this Friday to the attempt of the President of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, to launch an OPA (Public Procurement Offer) on the acronym of the former Giscardist Party, urging him to withdraw it from any support, I am sorry to be sued.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the UDF acronym, considering that François Bayrou was not in a position to defend his political heritage after having held his hand to the left.
On the other hand, the Minister of Defence, whose party is associated with the UMP, had planned to confirm the strategy on Saturday before the NC National Council.
As support for its management, he received the assistance of the former MP Hervé de Charette (formerly UMP, current NC) who claims the ownership of the UDF brand, since he was the first to register it at the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2004.
But on Friday night, the office of the UDF association, controlled by the friends of François Bayrou who do not want to be deprived of it, broke the silence to launch a petition to the Minister and the deputy urging them to renounce the acronym and transfer the rights of ownership of the brand, under penalty of judicial demand.
In recent days, you have made many statements implying that you were going to propose to your political movement to recover the UDF, write the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez del MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Athuis of the Centrist Alliance.
They also believe it is right to continue with the use of the name of the movement, the +Nouveau center+, and the slogan +'UDF d'ajourd'hui+ in their militant material and on the page of presentation of their site, they support the signers of the letter.
As you already know, you have no right to use the acronym, explains the UDF office that requires the NC to immediately withdraw the name of the UDF from any support, as well as from (your) Internet site -
She also asks Hervé de Charette - to transfer the property of (la) mark to the legitimate right-wings -
If not, it will appeal to justice to enforce the law and legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warn.
In the letter, they need the UDF - a real political movement since 1978 - and remember that Morin and his friends - chose - to go in 2007 - to create a new party, as others had already done in 2002 to create the UMP -
The New Centre therefore has no right, according to them, to use the UDF logo.
They also recall that the last UDF congress voted in 2007 to join the MoDem for three years and the creation of an office to defend the material and moral interests of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, continue the office, when he registered the mark, he was no longer a member of the UDF for three years, but of the UMP.
It scandalously and fraudulently takes advantage of the absence of registration of the acronym UDF to perform it on its own.
This indiscretion is becoming a crime, they denounce, before mocking the NC strategy: \"We believe that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make its own name than to try to get out of anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which one has no right\"
Liliane Bettencourt case: François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness
This Friday the Court of Nanterre decided to bring to trial the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt stated, he took advantage of the state of weakness of the octogenarian to expose her from a portion of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his photos of stars of the show, will be tried on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime whose sentence consists of a maximum sentence of three years in prison and 375,000 euros in fine.
This means that in this case there will be a process worthy of a saga on one of France's richest families, in which mother and daughter dispute the reins of the empire of cosmetics L'Oréal.
But the Correctional Court No. 15 also ordered that 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt be submitted to a medical examination by three medical professionals.
The heir and principal shareholder of L'Oréal always refused to submit to these examinations, even more under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Prosecutor's Office during the investigation.
Doctors appointed this Friday will be required to report before 10 March 2010 if Liliane Bettencourt has suffered from weak states and for which periods.
I think he'll take it.
I'm going to talk to her, Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman, was declared on the way out of the audience.
For his part, Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' lawyer, Olivier Metzner, was pleased with the court's decision.
It is an excellent news (...) The expert will show that he (Banier) manipulated this older woman, whom we must protect, he said.
For two years now, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter began criminal actions against François-Marie Bannier, a photographer and multifaceted artist, accusing him of taking advantage of his mother's weakness for years to obtain a billion euros in donations, through cheques, life insurance contracts or works of art.
For his part, Liliane Bettencourt has always denied having been manipulated by the photographer, whom he considers to be a long-standing friend.
On Friday, while the court examined the origin of the action brought by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers' allegations on some occasions resulted in a great family confession.
In this way, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer took into account three letters her client had sent (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary in which she said she was suspicious of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In the 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to counsel: “I could explain to my daughter that I wrote Banier between one and two times a day for fifteen years.
Since her wedding, I have never been able to speak to Françoise again -
For its part, the Nanterre Prosecutor ' s Office once again considered that the complainant was not in a position to appear, even more so since in recent days a guardian's judge refused to give way to his request to open a court case for his mother.
Liliane Bettencourt - has full capacity to appear before justice, is not under guardianship and has no guardian.
No other person will be able to appear in his place - said the representative of the Public Prosecutor's Office, Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
Finally, the court decided that the judgement on the admissibility of Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers would be rendered once the trial was carried out.
Management Revolution or End of Business Intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of the big French companies, our struggle for the development of business intelligence will have been in vain...
More than ten years ago, the attitude of the management of large companies with respect to their employees recalls the position of companies with respect to consumers before the marketing revolution: it is about the employees joining - values - determined from above as before it was about imposing on consumers products thought by factory technicians.
By putting the customer in the center of the company, the marketing revolution gave its place to the strategies to conquer the markets... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products that are unrelated to the preference factors of the customers is repeated regularly.
A demobilization of employees can end up in a deadly demoralization.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the tip of the iceberg of a much more general phenomenon that particularly affects executives.
This demobilization seriously undermines the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially R & D and, even more, business intelligence.
Indeed, the BI (Business Intelligence) - requires that all parties involved (...) have proactive conduct and a prospective vision - it needs a commitment from employees that is completely opposed to the recommendations of an authoritarian direction.
For this reason, we call for a managerial revolution, which would consist of putting the collaborators at the center of the company's concerns as well as the client.
Internal opinion surveys have a relative usefulness
Do internal opinion surveys, such as the questionnaire conducted by Orange among his employees, encourage the managerial revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
-In principle, because I could verify that, in the face of a new situation, and after many turns, all companies end up doing essentially... what they always did!
- Secondly, because authoritarianism, one of the pathologies of power, grows in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
-Finally, because most managers have a simplistic view of human behavior.
As they come from large engineering schools, they interpret psychology in a mechanical way.
They adopt, for intellectual comfort, the old behavioral theory that the Americans recently reactivated, and that the Institutes of Studies and the media widely spread behind their backs.
In this way, by suggesting that it is possible to handle the \"commands\" (sic) of the commitment of executives, a recent research by Ipsos published in Le Figaro.fr reaffirms the managers in a mechanistic management position, inadequate to the world today.
Identify and measure mobilization factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the good functioning of modern companies, involves adopting a finalist view of human behavior.
It consists of integrating into all reasoning or business management practice, a fundamental fact: for the employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it clearly appears as a means to make its dreams, ambitions and projects a reality.
Today, only studies from the Motivational Analysis adopt this conception of the motivations of employees.
The studies showed that they judge their company based on a default dox that allows them, through the image they have of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their own life projects.
With the identification and measurement of mobilisation factors, business managers can control, predict and anticipate their \"social performance\" and relocate human resource management in place.
In this way, they create a favourable ground for the organized development of a strong and effective business intelligence.
Speech from Oslo: for the fair war Obama receives praise from the right
This Friday, the North American right, pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize had defended the concept of “fair war” against the enemies of the United States, hailed Obama’s speech on Thursday.
Conservatives, who had discredited Obama's award on 9 October, applauded the presidential speech, as did Sarah Palin, former vice president candidate during the 2008 elections.
I loved what she said, said Mrs Palin, the lead figure on the right wing of the Republican party to the USA Today newspaper, and added that she had addressed the issue of war - sometimes necessary - in her recently published memoirs.
In my opinion, war is, of course, the last thing the Americans want to be forced to do, but it is necessary.
The terrorists must be arrested, he observed.
Obama, who inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, dedicated himself, this Thursday in Oslo, to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 more soldiers to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another Obama opponent, Newt Gingrich, considered that the president had done a very good job in Oslo.
I think that the speech was really good, was pleased by the former President of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the mention of -the existence of evil in the world - in the presidential words.
For moments, the speech seemed very historic, said Gingrich, during an interview in the radio program - The Takeaway -
The former elected representative, whom some consider to be a possible candidate for republican investment for the 2012 presidential elections, was pleased to hear — a left-wing president — when he reminded the members of the Nobel Committee — that they would not be free and could not give a peace prize if the use of force did not exist —
According to Michael Gerson, author of the speeches by George W. Bush and current chronicler at the Washington Post, Obama delivered a very American speech.
In addition to being a citizen of the world, as he always does, he spoke as a U.S. President, reminding Europeans, who live in a security bubble that they did not create and do not do much to preserve it, said Gerson.
Among the few not very convinced right, a Bush era hawk, the former UN ambassador, John Bolton, described the speech as \"monotone, pretentious and lack of inspiration\" on the National Review Online website.
On the left side of the president, the Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich alarmed to see Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
When we covered war with the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the massacre of innocents, he warned.
However, the left-center press praised the president.
Los Angeles Time, though still believing that Obama received the Nobel prematurely, qualified his \"super-production\" speech, especially for a speaker known for his talent.
Oslo's speech - should serve as a road map to guide international decisions in the fight against conflict, poverty and oppression - commented enthusiasticly on the California newspaper.
Obama “pronounced the discourse that was needed,” estimated the New York Times, judging it both as gloomy and edifying.
Carriage: three marathon negotiations to guarantee Christmas supply
After three sessions of Maratonic negotiations, the Road Trade Unions and the TLF (Transport and Logistics of France), the only employer organization that remained until the end, arrived on Friday afternoon at an agreement ending the strike slogan and the threat to the Christmas supply.
During the signing session on Friday evening, the secretary of state of transport, Dominique Bussereau, welcomed the agreement, after several negotiating sessions that began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussion, the negotiators fired at the dawn of Friday in the hope of fast signing the text according to the last hour of the morning.
Even when three employers' organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTR) withdrew by giving a cover.
But a meeting of more than six hours which began at 11 a.m. was necessary for everyone to agree and the text was signed at 6 p.m.
The conflict - it had been very detrimental to companies - and it was feared that it disrupted the end-of-year parties - said Bussereau.
The text provides for an increase of 4 per cent for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport), and 2.9 per cent for the highest (international transport).
The rate per hour rises from EUR 8.72 to 9.06 for low wages.
Not much, but we started off with a lot of disadvantage, Patrice Clos (FO) explained.
If so, we are going to order our militants that there are no more cuts or locks in the supply centers.
But there may always be some disengagement, he added.
Philippe Grillot, President of the TLF, acknowledged that this is a good agreement, although it was difficult to grant increases to high wages taking into account international competition.
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros per month for the low wages and from 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is an agreement with common sense that respects the employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) recognized it as - a historical agreement -
For Richard Jaubert (CGT) is an acceptable compromise -
The agreement also provides for an increase in the travel costs of 3 per cent and the holding of general road transport assemblies in the first half of 2010, which will enable, above all, to address the issue of extraordinary pay and modernisation of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled that, a drop of EUR 100 million in the employer charges, was the subject of an amendment by the government to the correction finance bill for 2009, which the National Assembly voted on Thursday night.
The government will ask the Senate to vote - under the same terms -
The TLF signature allows the agreement to be applied, first, to undertakings that are attached to this organization and secondly to the whole profession, in the event that the Minister of Labour makes an extension.
It will be carried out, with the utmost speed, by Bussereau.
Opposition by employers' organizations could only delay the process.
The FNTR reported that this was a \"ingenious business\" because the EUR 100 million had already been promised to the sector to compensate for part of the CO2 tax.
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate in an emergency situation, not as a conclusion to an analysis discussed by the parties, but not to oppose those who wish to eat turkey at the next dinner in Nochebuena, the Unostra was sorry.
For the OTRE, the agreement puts at risk the stability of many SMEs in the sector over the next 12 months.
RER A: conflicts during the weekend, unions disagree with RATP's proposals
The conflicts in RER A, the largest urban public transport line in France, will continue during the weekend, because at the Friday meeting, the second day of strike between trade unions and the leadership of the RATP, there was no agreement and the unions were dissatisfied with their request for a premium.
For this important Christmas shopping weekend, on Saturday and Sunday, trains will only circulate between 10 a.m. and 20 a.m., on the basis of a train of each two in the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and a train of every four in the other lines.
Interconnection with the SNFC will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, which will force passengers to change trains.
The Lafayette Galleries, which await 200,000 customers every day, were glad that - RATP strives to provide service to large shops -
The RER A crosses from West to East the Parisian city.
The RATP stretch runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
This Friday, about one in every two trains circulated in peak hours, and almost no train in valley hours, as had been anticipated.
On Thursday there was no disorder in the countryside thanks to the organization of the inhabitants of the island of France.
This way, at dawn, Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) station was much less crowded than usual, especially because of the absence of students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), 29-year-old engineer Jack Nbakina, explained that he had risen - an hour and a half earlier to get to schedule -
Saint-Lazare Station was not saturated, SNCF indicated that it had planned the supervision of police and law enforcement.
The RER A that operates the SNCF from Cergy-Le-Haut or destined for it arrived or left Saint-Lazare station to join the meters.
New general assemblies of strike workers will take place on Saturday and Sunday. The results will be analysed, - little satisfactory - according to the unions, of a meeting that took place with the management on Friday afternoon.
The Director of RERs proposes to negotiate a specific protocol in all aspects for RER A: working time, professional development, etc.
That is not what drivers want to claim a premium that is owed to them, according to Thierry Garon (South).
RATP even put its premium proposals in parenthesis, commented outraged the CGT, noting that the management - was not able to solve a problem that the SNCF and the road sector had already solved -
A new meeting is scheduled on Monday to carry out - a more extensive analysis of the conditions of exercise of the profession - specified RATP.
What also led the unions to say that the company didn't care about the end-of-week users.
In the morning, about 150 drivers invaded a committee at headquarters in Paris.
Then the address, which was denied until then to dialogue during the strike, suggested the meeting - to calm the waters -
The conflict could be extended to RER B on Tuesday, after the Unsa and the Independents have provided a notice.
Trade unions call for a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independents) and complain of the degradation of working conditions in this line that has a million passengers per day.
RER drivers, all in the second grade of their professional career, charge from EUR 2,200 to 2,700 gross and from EUR 600 to EUR 650 of premiums, for hours with alternate shifts, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves the prokurdian party, a decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court failed on Friday in favour of the dissolution of the country's main procurative party, a decision that immediately provoked manifestations of anger in the Kurdish community, in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could seriously complicate the task of the government, which has just given the Kurdish community a hand in trying to put an end to 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society (DTP) party was disbanded because it had become the \" focus of activities that harmed the independence of the State and its indivisible unity \" , declared to the press the President of the Court, Hasim Kiliz, after four days of deliberations.
The decision of the 11 judges was unanimous, although only a seven-voting majority was required to obtain the dissolution, said Kiliz, adding that 37 of the party's leaders, including their President Ahmet Türk and Deputy Aysel Togluk, were cut off from political life for five years.
The judge also announced the cessation of parliamentary immunity of which Türk and Tugluk enjoyed, and the confiscation of the property of the party by the Treasury.
The DTP has 21 banks in Parliament (550).
Its leaders warned before the verdict that Members would abandon Parliament before they were MPs with no partisan label.
The decision stems from a procedure launched by the Supreme Court Prosecutor Abdulrahman Yalçinkaya in 2007, who accuses the DTP of obeying the \"principles\" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many other countries.
Numerous observers believe that DTP is the legal political scapegoat of the PKK rebels.
However, the party claims that it does not have - organic links - with the PKK, but refuses to call it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The Tribunal's verdict intervenes at the time when the government lends a hand to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen its rights, so that the Kurds stop supporting the PKK and thus end the conflict.
The DTP leaders claimed that a dissolution could lead to a rise in tensions in the Southeast Anatolio, where a large number of demonstrations against the conditions of detention of the PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan have degenerated into clashes with the police over the past few weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, thousands of protesters have met in front of the DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the great Southeast care, mostly populated by Kurds.
The Order Forces threw tear grenades and used water cannons, while demonstrators launched Molotov bombs or stones with hounds.
In Istanbul, approximately one hundred people were also concentrated.
After the verdict, Türk stated that the decision of justice was going to - deepen the discouragement -
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (Kurdish, NDLR) by dissolving a party, declared to the press.
The government, made up of a party from the Islamist movement, also regrets the decision.
At first we oppose the closure of parties.
So nothing is resolved, said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
This decision completely boycotts the democratic openness launched by the government, commented political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can expect, of course, a reaction from the PKK, he added.
This Thursday, the PKK was awarded an attack in which seven soldiers were killed three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the most bloody attacks of the last few months.
Snow can start suddenly
A truly cool winter is what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
At all, it is something with which it wants to make life impossible for citizens, comments the director of road maintenance in winter of the EDF
But with this, your employees can learn to test and master the entire vehicle technology.
Maybe on the weekend the weather experts will announce it for the first time.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
In this case the EDF acts in accordance with a detailed plan.
As soon as it snows profusely in Frankfurt and temperatures fall below zero degrees, 20 of the so-called A sections with large vehicles with salt, explains Brauburger.
For example, the main arteries and avenues such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße are included.
But also access to the body of firefighters, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and slopes, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
The FES service starts around 3 a.m.
It should be covered approximately 1,040 kilometres, as necessary, within a maximum of three hours with moist salt, which adheres better.
That's why the EDF starts around three o'clock in the morning, with it the tracks are free until the traffic of the peak hours begins.
The difficulty is when it starts snowing around 7:30 a.m.
\"Then we have a problem,\" says the director of road maintenance in the winter, \"because then no one is ready to clear space for vehicles with salt\"
Immediately afterwards, when it is no longer snowing, it touches the secondary and private roads, to which also belongs the Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority is the side and secondary streets.
That's where the discomforts are generated, you know Brauburger.
Around five o'clock in the morning, the FES infantry is launched, mostly the dangerous points and cruises are cleared.
Generally, the EDF could not handle the entire bicycle lanes.
In Frankfurt there is a special service, which from 22 to 4:30 a.m. does not lose sight mainly of bridges, says Brauburger.
As these become rapidly shaken, the vehicle with salt is launched as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees.
In the event of an emergency, the police may also call them.
The cradle of the dinosaur
The Tawa found the same look as many other carnivorous dinosaurs: a two-metre-long and 1.50-foot-high animal running on the two strong hind legs, had a long head with sharp teeth and curves, short arms with claws shaped like hoz and a long tail.
If the species had lived a couple million years later, it would not have been something special.
But Tawa foundlae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt from the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the Thursday Science magazine.
The species lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which was then in a dry area of the Pangea supercontinent on the equator.
Tawa opened a new window towards the early evolution of dinosaurs, Nesbitt comments.
It shows us much about the genealogical relationships, the propagation and characteristics of the early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began an excavation at Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
Sometimes, we have found in one day a dozen dinosaur bones, this is something unprecedented for Triassic sediments, reports Randall Irmis member of the Utah Museum of Natural History team.
Researchers quickly identified some bones as belonging to a new species.
In the course of the excavation the remains of five specimens gathered in total.
A find confirms the theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs
The name - Tawa - comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt is an exceptional finding: -The dinosaur fossils of the Triassic are extremely rare, usually only individual fragments are found -
Other dinosaur experts do not fully share such enthusiasm.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs, comments for example Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to the current trend of opinion, dinosaurs appeared for the first time about 230 million years ago.
But many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, so the classification of these early dinosaurs is quite controversial.
Thus, the experts discuss, for example, when the sauaries were divided into their three most important genealog lines: the carnivorous terropods among which the Tyrannosaurus Rex, the Velociraptor and also the birds, the quadruped sauropods known as the long neck, and their relatives, and the herbivorous Ornithischia (sauri with ave pelvis), to whom, for example, the Triceratops and Stegosaurus species belong.
According to Nesbitt's analysis and his colleagues, Tawa foundlae is a primitive teropod.
This shows an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, comments Nesbitt.
For example, in the Tawa skull, researchers found signs of air bags, such as those that also possess the descents of the teropods, birds.
Thanks to air bags, birds' breathing is more efficient than that of mammals.
In the case of Tawa find also the bones of the spine were evidently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the teropod with oldest and most primitive air bags, Randall Irmis comments.
Because the parent line of the subsequent giant sauropods also had air bags and light bones, it was likely that the common predecessors of both groups would already produce this useful innovation.
At least three migratory waves to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs so far known lived in South America, researchers conclude that the sauaries first emerged there.
Therefore, the three genealogical lines separated at an early stage and spread from South America through all the corners of the Earth, which by then still formed a unique earth mass, the supercontinent Pangea.
However, the facts say that the team found together with Tawa find the remains of two other teropods not closely related.
The three cannot descend from a single parented predecessor, the researchers argue.
We believe that at least three migratory waves were made to North America, comments Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of the Science Study.
Of course, there are opponents as well.
An even older species, Silesaurus, who belongs to a brother group of dinosaurs, lived in the present-day Poland, comments by the paleontologist of Bonn Martin Sander.
His opinion could give a distorted image, because simply in South America many dinosaur fossils are still being preserved, while in other continents there is hardly anything to discover.
The question of how dinosaurs were able to evolve from a relatively rare collateral line of reptiles to the dominant terrestrial vertebrates of Mesozoic remains an enigma.
Meanwhile, in the Triassic dinosaurs still shared their vital space with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of the present crocodiles and the pterosaurus and many other sauries.
Towards the end of the Triassic dinosaurs expanded throughout the world and many new species developed, while the kinship became extinct at the limit of the Triassic towards Jurassic.
Success stories were not eternal
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, Martin Sander comments.
There could have been a massive extinction to which dinosaurs survived by chance, but the other reptiles did not.
Or dinosaurs were better suited, so they were able to beat the opponents in the area.
Success stories are not always eternal.
150 million years later, an impact of meteorite brakes the rise of a group of species, which had also evolved in the Triassic and since then carried a miserable existence: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and international signatories.
Teachers attend the University of Toronto, Cambridge, Vienna or Berkeley, California.
Teachers from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen participate.
The police eviction of the busy casino of the Goethe University of Frankfurt impacted worldwide.
278 professors and professors from Goethe University, although also from higher education centers throughout Germany, Europe and North America and the South, stand in solidarity with students in protest at the Westend Campus.
In a statement in German and English, \"reject\" the police eviction promoted by the Board of Directors.
Werner Müller-Estler, president of the university, made the building occupied by students and teachers last week on an educational strike, because the walls and works of art were covered with propaganda.
As a result, five students suffered injuries.
The material damages, the signatories judge, do not justify - the violent dissolution of the courses organized by the same students and professors by a police command -
The eviction represented an — an unacceptable attack — on freedom of research and learning.
The exclusive approach to vandalism served to - the delegitimization and criminalization of the protest - and diverted the attention of the content.
The Governing Council has refused to enter into the necessary negotiations.
Teachers call for the immediate withdrawal of the judicial claim.
Most occupants have not caused material damage, it is said.
Legitimized protest
The young people of the Verdi union and the German Federation of Trade Unions are also in solidarity with the students.
The protest is the legitimate expression of a growing concern for the future itself, comments Verdi's national youth secretary Alexander Klein.
Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), Minister of Science of Hessen, however, defended the performance of the university and police director.
We're grateful to the headmaster of the university.
The destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, he commented on an issue of Aktuelle Stunde on Thursday in the Parliament of Wiesbaden province.
We are understanding with the protest, but we are not understanding with vandalism, said Peter Beuth, delegate of the provincial parliament for the CDU.
The opinion of the opposition factions, the SPD, the Greens and the Left, is different.
The CDU used the walls painted as a pretext to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Left).
Instead of studying students' arguments and demands in depth, they are evicted.
Izquierda has submitted a motion requesting the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on police intervention.
New Silicon Valley
For many years, it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of the ten districts in Moscow, was in the Soviet Union a heavily guarded site for secret arms investigation.
Today, the community of 216,000 inhabitants, 37 kilometres from the centre of Moscow, is considered to be the \"Silicon Valley Russian\"
Here are important research and production centers for micro and nanoelectronics.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd have contacted Riedberg's scientific headquarters in Frankfurt, with university institutes and companies at the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
A number of mutual visits were given and now, on Wednesday, Selenograd and Riedberg sign in Frankfurt a \"close collaboration protocol\"
Moscow Deputy Mayor Juri Rosljak and Selengrad Mayor Anatoly Smirnov led the Russian delegation; Frankfurt signed the Chief of Planning Services Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010 they will travel to a seminar in Selenograd representatives of the FIZ and directors of small and medium-sized enterprises of the research center of natural sciences.
Scientific exchange
This is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it also addresses trade relations.
FIZ companies will have the opportunity to put a foothold on the growing Russian market.
In return, Russian scientific companies wish to have access to contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is the home of important Russian companies and research institutes.
These include, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the major Sitronic and Rossijskaja Elektronika consortia.
The community was founded in 1958 as the so-called \"Ciudad de planação socialiste\" for arms investigation.
Selenograd (translated literally as -Green City) received its name from the landscape of forested mountains, in which research facilities were established.
Stuttgart Brakes
The Stuttgart 21 Dimension is not positioned for anything high enough.
For supporters of the project it is simple and flatly dealt with — the new heart of Europe —
S21 is much more than the reduction of a railway station, than a monstrous construction project, which will precipitate to the capital of the region of Banden-Württemberga a decade of chaos of irremediable construction sites.
Stuttgart 21 came from the spirit of the 1980s.
Terminals with rieles, which ended in the middle of the city, were then considered as engineering fossils of the 19th century, which acted as brakes of a modern rail traffic, since in the past a huge amount of time was needed to hook the locomotives back forward.
Roll, stop dry continue the journey; but so must be done.
And that's why the terminals had to disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a passing station, which is about halfway through the trans-European lines of operation between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava; hence the slogan of \"Couration of Europe\"
The S21 will actually be started, despite the fact that the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious designers have known that in the Hessian and Bavarian capitals it is almost impossible to implement the reduction.
Railway terminals of course do not have any more problems of entry and exit, since there are reversible locomotives with tractor unit and driver car on both ends.
However: Stuttgart 21 including the new frame built ICE towards Ulm will already be started.
Federal and communal politicians have arranged this way.
The railway continues, also because the risks of the large individual infrastructure projects of the Republic are borne by the taxpayer rather than by the State.
From the urban point of view, the project is still justified to a certain extent.
New urban space is created, with many green areas, probably from the graphics generated by the designer's computer.
For the rail transport system the S21 is harmful.
The transit station and road support are designed for the transport of people, which was attributed to the huge growth typical of the 1980s.
At that time, there was no competition for low-cost flights.
But modern transport policy must first be taken care of strengthening the transport of goods, since rail transport is considerably more environmentally friendly than that carried out by trucks on the roads.
However, the new construction sections are good for freight trains due to intense gradients.
Even more serious is that the S21 also indirectly affects many other railway projects.
More than six billion euros must be buried in the Zuavos.
That's the official figure.
Experts believe that it is more realistic between ten and fifteen billion.
It is certain that in the next decade the money will be missing in other crosses and narrow passages on the network.
A total of sixty major projects are listed in the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the expansion of more than 180 kilometers of long streams through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987 the trace has been built slowly.
It would be urgent here to step on the accelerator as it is due.
However, the S21 acts as a brake.
The stretch of the Rhine Valley will be the bottleneck for international freight transport: through the heart of Europe.
The government examines the ruling on the airport.
The federal government leaves outstanding in the Wiesbaden autonomic parliament, if it will submit an appeal to the Hesse Administrative Court's decision on the night flight ban.
The CDU/FDP coalition seems to have commissioned experts to investigate the VGH judgment of more than 400 pages, according to the Minister of Economy, Dieter Posch (FDP).
The administrative court in Kassel had based in writing on this date, that in the case of the construction of the planned northwest landing track at Frankfurt airport, the federated state would have to re-regulate the night flight ban.
The admission of 17 flights between 23 and 5 hours, as envisaged by the federal government, would not be compatible with the mandatory legal protection of the noise population due to air traffic.
The coalition has to decide until 4 January, if it will bring an appeal against this judgment.
The opposition criticized this postponement and pressured government representatives to renounce the appeal to the Administrative Court of the Nation in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD group, Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel, urged the CDU and the FDP to respect their promises to ban night air traffic, which they had made before the elections. Otherwise this could be taken as a lack of word.
It is quite difficult, if one is allowed to keep his word, the head of the green Tarek Al-Wazir said, referring to the slogan of the FDP - We fulfill our word -
Minister Posch rejected the recrimination of Schäfer-Gümbel, which the federative government would be trying through legal distortions and tricks yet to obtain his night flights.
Comprehensive legal investigation would take considerable time.
The coalition would not like to act on the basis of a \"first quick print\"
We need a legally untouchable decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As the opposition represents, it would never have been his group's statements about the night air traffic ban.
The U.S. banks return the aid provided.
The great U.S. banks shaken by the crisis are stripped of their state bonds.
The ‘Bank of America’ only returned the aid that the Tarp bank rescue fund had provided for it of a total of 45,000 million (approximately EUR 30 billion).
And also the Citi group plans to return state aid, according to a report from the United States CNBC.
In this way, the institutes intend to free themselves from the restrictions that had gone hand in hand with the acceptance of money, such as the limitation on the payment of bonuses to directors, as well as the payment of high rates.
The Bank of America had achieved approximately 19 billion net money through convertible bonds.
The rest of the sum took it from the box itself, which had quite a few means, including for the sale of rubles.
Bank manager Kenneth Lewis thanked U.S. taxpayers for Wednesday night especially: the financial injection helped overcome very difficult times.
The bank had miscalculated the effort to absorb the investment bank at the climax of the financial crisis.
The Citi group also seeks to obtain money in the capital market in order to be able to free from its obligations to the state.
CNBC reported from known circles that the U.S. bank could announce by Thursday the increase in its capital by $20 billion.
A representative of the Citi group did not wish to comment.
In June they had already returned their Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley aids.
Quick Select
In the end everything was faster than thought.
Just two weeks after the ZDF Administrative Council (German TV channel) presses the drafting chief Nikolaus Brender to leave his post, the channel can present a successor.
Last night the guild intended to vote about the candidate.
The favorite was Peter Frey, director of the ZDF main studio in Berlin.
There was no confirmation of this by the station, officially not to anticipate the procedure.
But it certainly also influenced the no longer to harm the director of the ZDF Markus Schächter, if this proposal would not be approved on the administrative board.
Frey, the candidate for Schächter, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the guild.
The result of the vote was not yet stated at the closing of this edition.
Two weeks ago Schächter failed on the administrative board with his proposal to renew Nikolaus Brender's contract for another five years.
Only seven members supported Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's dismissal was a bitter failure for Schächter, but a failure that could be expected.
Because the majority of the Union on the administrative board already weeks before the election had indicated that they were not going to support Brender in his position.
The opposition against the drafting leader had been organized by the president of the government of Hesse, Mr.Roland Koch.
He declined another mandate of the prestigious editor with the argument, which under the direction of Brender the information of the ZDF would have lost audience indexes.
Until shortly before the elections there were protests because of this, in which he flouted political influence over the ZDF.
At the end, 35 experts in public law who described Koch's course as unconstitutional had entered into the debate.
But it didn't serve anything.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and Romanic philology.
He later worked at the station -Südwestfunk - and in the newspaper -Frankfurter Rundschau -
In 1983 it was changed to the ZDF, in principle to the information -heute-journal -
The following stations: 1988 to 1990 personal rapporteur of the drafting chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; up to 1998 director and conductor of the morning programme -Morgenmagazins - until 2001 director of the foreign policy of the ZDF; since then director of the study of the ZDF in the capital.
The political party of the Greens announced a constitutional demand after the removal of Brender, which was elected even this Wednesday as a journalist of the year by the media magazine \"Medium Magazin\"
The opposite of Koch in the administrative council, the president of the Rhineland-Palatinate government, explained last week that the federated states should change the state convention of the ZDF in such a way that the manager's staff proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
A retreat of politicians in favour of the ZDF control guilds was discarded by Beck.
Brender's likely successor, Peter Frey, was recommended to the administrative board with an intelligent move: he strongly criticized the guild for the dismissal of Brender.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence, both Schächter was able to appoint him for the post of editor without losing his face, as the administrative council was able to vote, without falling under suspicion of giving the post to a supporter.
In the calculations of the Frey parties it is awarded in any way to the liberals on the left.
University careers are going off
Partial success for students: after a year of strikes related to education, the Ministers of Education and Culture of the federated states finally gave in. At a meeting of the Ministers of Education and Culture with university directors, both sides agreed to try to improve the conditions of study in the cases of degree and master.
Students in a future should be able to overcome their careers.
For example, they agreed to reduce the burden of examinations: basically, each career module should end with only one examination.
It is also intended to examine the workload of students, and it is intended to ensure a \"real and justifiable measure\"
Policy and universities also want to simplify the recognition of exam results between universities within and outside Germany.
The federated states undertake to make the structural rules more flexible together for Bachelor and Master racing.
Rules of the federated states that differ from this, must no longer exist.
Less exams
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, the Ministers of Education and Culture and the directors of the universities have spoken continuously about improving the ability to achieve and successfully complete a career (study).
Now for the first time it was talked about a specific content.
The so-called Accreditation Board agreed to drastically reduce the number of exams: “Each module ends with a single exam” is said in a 30-page document, which aims to partially regulate the approval of university careers.
With the “sensitive reduction in the burden of examinations”, the aim is to avoid development in a wrong direction, which would significantly affect the studyability, as explained by the director of the accreditation board, Mr Reinhold Grimm.
In addition, in the future the \"studyability\" must be the decisive criterion in the configuration.
Modules and contents should be thoroughly examined as to the unnecessary restrictions of students in the choice of.
the courses.
Students would have the right to obtain more spaces, which would enable and encourage their own initiative.
These rules would apply to new careers, but also to the examination of existing careers.
These must be re-believed again every five years. But this would mean, it would take up to 2015 to examine all races.
Those responsible for this would be at the country-wide level 10 accreditation agencies, which are under the supervision of the Accreditation Board, which is installed by the federated states.
The ministers of education and culture urged the federated states in October to influence agencies in such a way that the quantity of subjects and examinations are not too strict or demanding.
In some federated states universities and technical schools have already agreed with ministries to take such measures.
So far only Rhineland-Platinate has ensured to provide additional means for the subsequent development of the Bologna process.
With this money universities must implement tutoring and student advice programs, as well as strengthen examination offices and abroad.
The Federal State and the universities intend to have EUR 10 million for these purposes.
In early 2010 the government wanted to bring to parliament a novel of university law.
According to her, it should be sufficient for a single examination for the completion of a career model.
Career configuration should become more flexible, and we want to ensure recognition of evaluations at other universities and facilitate accessibility to the Master.
Until the end of the next year, we intend to examine all careers about their \"studyability\"
This Thursday the government and the opposition discussed again the conditions for studying in the federated state.
Apart from the compliments, there were also criticisms about the decisions.
The board of directors at the federal level of the Juso university groups (social youth) demanded, that the configuration of educational policy should no longer be carried out - after closed doors - of ministers and university directors.
Not later than after the strikes of education, now students as principals involved should be able to take an opinion as well.
The president of the University Board of Directors (HRK), Margret Wintermantel, gave her support to the students: \"We need the experience of the students,\" said on Thursday in a meeting with the Ministers of Education, with whom HRK decided on a joint reform document.
For the education and science union (GEW) Bonn's agreements were not entirely sufficient: the union requires a legal right for each student with the title of Bachelor to access a later Master's career.
In addition, the federated states have to ensure that for the current generation of Bachelor students there are in the future sufficient places of study for Master with the best possible conditions of study. This was reported by a member of the GEW, Mr. Andreas Keller.
The federated states have to recruit a lot more teachers.
But about greater access to the master's degree, the Ministers of Education did not comment.
More than a footnote about Herta Müller
\"Getting in and out of Germany is practically uncontrollable,\" says the first line of a poem by the lyric Werner Söllner in disequilibrating idiomatic fragments, in which he feared the experiences of coming to Germany lived by a dissident, who gained his freedom, but lost the environment of his language.
Werner Söllner, who was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, worked at first as a German and English teacher in Bucharest, and then as a reader in an editorial of children's books, before moving to Frankfurt in 1982.
Söllner was awarded several literature awards, in 1993 he taught the memorable poetry lessons or talks in Frankfurt at Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been the director of the literature forum in Hesse in the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
God has to speak a lot on Tuesday during a meeting in Munich about - German literature in Romania in the mirror and the disfigured mirror of their Security files -
Visually insecure and embarrassed, Söllner read a statement in which he admitted participation as IM in Romanian Secret Service Security against fellow German-Roman writers, among others Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of those present in 1989, Söllner had received the German Language Award.
Recruitment attempts had begun slowly in early 1971.
\"I am therefore someone who did not defend himself sufficiently in the face of attempts to provoke fear of Security,\" concluded Söllner.
The lyric Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time as the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature to Herta Müller and his unprecedented literary controversy with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene is shaken and in particular the community of German authors from Romania for a case that shows the chasms and the evil of a political system, which is based on control and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, therefore known so far, not only author but also victim.
In his IM Walter Security file, he had played a role, said literary scientist Michael Markel after Söllner's confession, and stressed the influence for him positive of IOM Walter.
He had excused or defended him at all the difficult points for him, Markel said.
“I feel the moral need to make this statement,” he said.
Söllner's statement in this form and in front of this audience was unexpected, the confession of an ex-disident and his work with the Romanian secret service, however, does not surprise that much.
Germany would have been a comfortable shelter for Security-Spitzel gewesen spies, she wrote Herta Müller already in July on the week-weekly - Zeit - after reading her own 914-page file.
Those involved would probably have speculated and would have known in some cases, what names were hidden behind the pseudonyms of Sorin, Voicu, and Walter as well.
Unlike the revision of the Stasi files with a controlled procedure in Germany, the treatment with the security control files is still quite widespread.
Systematic clarification has been boycotted and difficult in recent years.
A national council for the clarification of the files of the Security (CNSAS), for the Authority Birthler, was formed in 1999, and the delivery of the files since then has been more likely to be traced.
Since 2005, there has been a law governing the administration of files.
An interview, following the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature to Herta Müller, proves that the influence of former members of the Security in Romania is still quite great. In this interview a former head of Temesvar Security spoke contemptuously of the award.
\"She has psychosis\" in the end she was only questioned once.
The infamy of power seemed to be able to show itself unturned in the form of freedom of opinion.
Of course, unavoidable questions arise with the Söllner case, like so many times when there are silent guilts.
Why right now? Who is harmed? The calm reaction of listeners to the confession of Söllner allows us to hope that the continuation of this story will be more governed by the anxiety of knowledge and not so much by the award of guilt and shame.
For the genesis of Herta Müller's work, which yesterday accepted the Nobel Prize in Literature, it is more than just a footnote.
The Champions League as a garrison to fill the stomach
When the new VfB football team coach from Stuttgart, Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag from his team's supplier, boarded a Mercedes taxi from Class C a quarter hour after midnight, gave the impression that an elegantly dressed outside service member was leaving a very nice Christmas celebration, in which the sports goods manufacturer had distributed samples.
The bald man had hired a driver, because he had not yet met the city.
On the other hand, he could also drive the car himself: in the end, there was no alcohol at stake, and the 55-year-old man was not drunk with joy either.
It had been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow it would start work again.
I'd start it for the first time.
In the words of the Swiss, who had been hired just three days before: \"It is true that we reached the eighths of the final - namely, in the League of Champions, thanks to triumph 3:1 against Unirea Urziceni, from Romania, \"but we cannot let ourselves be blinded by success: we will have to fight brutally against descent\"
The \"much more important area\" was waiting for them the next Sunday, he said.
Then, it will be necessary to repeat in Maguncia the success of the \"real classes\" in the daily life of the league.
And eliminate the weaknesses, which have been clearly demonstrated again, after the rapid three goals of Marica (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Luck
The eighth finals of the League of Champions (from 16/17 to 23/24 February/return parties 9/10 and 16/17 March) will be drawn on 18 December in Nyon.
So the joy was limited by the fulminant entrance of Babbel's successor.
Not only in the alleged savior, who had soon inspired the disconcerted Stuttgart professions confidence in themselves, willingness to surrender and taste for the game.
I went with the players and told them that they had to focus on their strengths, I urged them to be more launched, explained the Gross soul repairer's recipe for success that so simple sounds, but that with the Babbel therapist no longer had any effect.
He deployed a certain magic, accepted Babbel's supporter, Jens Lehmann, when a new impulse emerges in football, sometimes things happen that have not been believed to be possible.
And Sami Khedira, who after a several-week break due to an injury advanced immediately until he became the best local player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the \"phenomenon\" perceived with the proverbial - fresh wind - and the way to work of the new boss: -He is a man who intervenes thoroughly, and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation -
And this is what I had obviously missed when I was Babbel.
The VfB Stuttgart hasn't passed the test yet, warns sports director Horst Heldt
But the VfB Stuttgart needs mostly constancy.
Like Gross, players and the administrator also refrained from overvaluing the triumph against a weakened defense for lack of relief and fully overcrowded from the Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen with the 0:4 had come the sad awakening, told Khedira to think.
And Director Horst Heldt warned that while a target had been reached for the season, the other was still very far away.
We have not yet overcome the problem.
That Heldt had no desire to celebrate on his 40th birthday, even after the first victory in his home three months ago, was due to the events of the weekend, which again updated in the form of a television interview, transmitted just before the start of the game, which had granted the doorman Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions that take others, not Jens, against Heldt's harsh criticism of Lehmann.
He had reproached weakness in the direction of the governing council, which had decided to change as a coach by the pressure of adolescent fanatics.
Also that his day off after the games had been eliminated, Lehmann called him a sign of lack of sovereignty and hostility.
Lehmann's statements were - marked by pure selfishness - rejected Heldt, and announced consequences for the latter.
You probably won't be friends forever, the two quarantines.
But at least they agreed with everyone else that, without the prior efforts with the team of the replacement coach, it would not have been possible the show of great strength of play and battle.
Babbel and his assistants — an important participation in success — said Heldt and Lehmann to the Unison; and also agreed with the man in the plastic case.
World heavyweight championship fur
Fiery grief in Bern: over and over again Rector Kevin Johnsonn was provoking the world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title in the WBC version.
The judges' trial was unanimous.
Hamburg: Vitali Klitschko remains a world heavyweight champion.
The 38-year-old champion in the WBC version won the U.S. Kevin Johnson on Friday to Saturday by unanimous decision on points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko it was his third successful title defense since his return in October 2008.
Previously, Ukrainian was already twice the world champion of WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to carry out the walnut that everyone had hoped for.
Klitschko expanded his balance to 39 triumphs in 41 professional fights, twice he had to give up due to his injuries.
Rector Johnson had to accept the first defeat in his fight number 24.
Before about 17000 spectators in the Bern Arena, Klitschko, with a height of 2.02 meters, wanted to dictate the fight especially with his left hand.
But Johnson, 11 centimeters lower, than before the duel had proclaimed the end of the Klitschko era, was dodging again and again from the blows of the world champion, so Klitschko could not decisively carry his dangerous right to his goal.
In general terms, the passive Johnson did too little for a rector, and only tried to pass the rounds.
While he was provoking Klitschko with words and gestures, his strokes only rarely reached the world champion.
However, he is now the second boxer, after Timo Hoffmann in the year 2000, who endured twelve rounds complete with Klitschko.
Prior to the fight, the detainee had already produced a certain scandal in the Swiss capital.
He had insulted Klitschko as a \"horrible zombie\" who -- he doesn't know how to do anything --
By weighing, the champion let himself be provoked on Friday to remove Johnson's sunglasses from his nose - so that he could see his eyes -
Fourth triumph after the return of Klitschko
Also in his fourth fight after his return on 11 October 2008, Klitschko remained invincible.
After a nearly four-year break, he won at that time the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin, and had recovered - his - his - WBC belt, which had previously had to give up without fighting.
That year later he won in his defenses of the title to Juan Carlos Gómez of Cuba, and in September to Chris Arreola of the United States.
In this fight I only got one blow, and I'm in very good physical condition, I had explained Klitschko's quick return to the ring.
But his dream is still gathering all four important titles in his family.
His brother Vladimir is a world champion of WBO and IBF associations.
However, the belt belongs to the British David Haye, after the belt dethroned in November to Nikolai Valujev, 2.13 meters tall.
In the previous summer, Haye had canceled a fight against Vitali Klitschko planned for September.
Supposedly, the company that promotes it is already planning the fight against Klitschko at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack of the opposition: the head of the Green Group, Jürgen Trittin, called the Minister of Defense a liar, Gutenberg, due to false information about the Kunduz issue.
The SPD and leftists demand explanation from the chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - After the latest revelations about the Kunduz air attack, the opposition has reproached the Minister of Defense, Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU), for having deluded him knowingly.
On Saturday's news broadcast, broadcast by TV channel ARD, the head of the green group, Jürgen Trittin, said that the minister-a well-known had not told the truth- about the deadly bombing of two convoys.
In such a case, it is usually said: he said lies.
The killing order would have been given without regard to the rules of the International Troop of Protection for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the NATO report, which Mr Gutenberg has read, Trittin said.
On Friday it had been announced that this attack was not only about destroying the kidnapped trucks, but also about intentionally killing two Taliban leaders.
In the United States air attack, requested by the German commander of Kunduz, Colonel Klein, according to the NATO investigation report, killed or injured up to 142 people.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left called on Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to pronounce immediately before the federal parliament and to clarify what Gutenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms. Merkel had to clarify whether a strategy of intentional murder was part of the federal government's Afghanistan policy, and if the Chancellorship, the Army and the Information Service had approved this new strategy, they demanded Jürgen Trittin and his colleague from the Greens Renate Künst.
The government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm firmly rejected criticism.
The Foreign Ministry did not exert any influence on the specific actions of the German army in Afghanistan, he said.
There were also doubts about the presentation made by the Ministry on the grounds of the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to the SPIEGEL, they had both informed Gutenberg correctly and completely about the background of the attack on convoys.
Officially, it had been said that they had denied the existence of NATO reports and had hidden sensitive details from the Minister.
However, from the environment of the two high-ranking officials they had even pointed out to the Ministry of Defence the existence of several reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein, who was in charge, and a report by a field patrol.
In the meantime, Wichert would have asked in a letter to clarify the matter, reports the newspaper \"Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung -
So far he has not received an answer, it has been said.
The ministry did not speak on Saturday about the complaints made to it, and he pointed out that this would be clarified in the Federal Parliament's committee of inquiry, which will be set up next Wednesday.
Onyric worlds
In a state of vigilance, some people see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in the case of mentally ill people and drug addicts are the limits between imagination and reality.
As long as it happens during sleep, everything is in order.
When we are lying in our dark rooms with our eyes closed, we can unstoppably give ourselves to the wildest imaginations and creations of fantasy.
However, anyone who experiences sleep-like states during the wake, or sees and hears things that others do not see or hear, is most often regarded in the modern Western world as crazy or drug addict, or at least as a maniac.
But such images and voices not only arise in the mentally ill or in drug addicts.
Blame has our imagination: the same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels, sometimes cause the boundaries between sleep, madness and reality to be disfigured.
Humanly modified alert states can appear in the most diverse forms, in the best of cases we call them visions, and in the worst, madness.
Although triggers and effects can be distinguished, such processes can be referred to the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the psychedelic experiences of the prophet of the New Era Carlos Castañeda, the states of chamanic possession, and psychosis and hallucinations.
Hallucinations or deliriums arise when the balance of the neural substances of communication in the brain has been derailed - in particular dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - and the interaction between various parts of it is disturbed.
During a schizophrenic psychosis very often complex hallucinations and crazy thoughts appear.
Gravity no longer has power over him
The relationship between madness and sleep has occupied philosophers and doctors since ancient times.
Aristotle conceived hallucinations as a form of sleep in a state of vigilance, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, observed in 1861 a \"great resemblance of the state of madness to the dream states\" for Sigmund Freud, the dream even was \"a psychosis, with all the disproposals, assigned formations, and spices of it\"
It is the fall of 2001, when Henning T. becomes a comic figure.
Its body is two-dimensional and scandalously colorful.
Gravity no longer has power over it, it's floating near the roof of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind him, figures of demons with wings, with red mussels like blood, deformed, brushing their teeth.
They're chasing him, kicking him with heavy, flaming boots, throwing him against the walls, he feels the pains in the whole body.
Squeezing and evil voices echo from the walls and radio.
He can no longer bear them, the voices that insult and offend him.
Henning T. pulls two wires out of the stereo, ties them together to form a hanger knot, and fixes them on a hook on the roof.
He climbs in a mouth and lays his knot around his neck.
Jump.
The rope's loose.
Let it serve you as a lesson!, yell the voices in a choir that turns the timpans back, - go to the clinic and make them heal you -
Now, Henning T. is 40 years old and has experienced six acute psychosis, the last two years, the first almost 20 years ago.
The cause that produced it was the LSD.
Its diagnosis is schizo-affective-paranoid psychosis, besides it is manic-depressive, takes medications, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, for three years he has been married.
In psychosis I have experienced the most terrible distress and deepest despair, he says.
Hallucinations are a cruel reality
Approximately one percent of the population falls ill at least once in the life of schizophrenia; psychiatric clinics treat it as the second most common disease after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, most of the time the affected can no longer distinguish between the outside world and the interior, and fall into a state of overexcitation that can lead to hallucinations, deliriums of greatness, relationship disorders, or persecution.
Especially widespread is the hearing of voices: voices giving orders, commenting or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also common.
The affected person is no longer able to distinguish what is important from what is not, the brain can no longer filter the disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like sleep, psychosis also opens the gates to a multitude of ideas and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis focuses on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief physician of the general psychiatric clinic of the Heidelberg university hospital.
The schizophrenic is located in the center of events, everything has a meaning aimed at it.
At the same time he enters a passive role, as in a dream, he feels overwhelmed by events and cannot actively organize them.
That is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general it is not possible to adjust the reality to them, hallucinations are a cruel reality, waking up, impossible.
Having experienced a hallucination once in life
Unlike in a dream, Fuchs says, -the spatial and sensory structure of reality perceived in psychosis remains in principle such as -
Paranoid thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the distancing of experience takes place in reality.
For researchers, it's still an incognite why our brain makes goats.
According to Fuchs, states of emergency can lead anyone to lose contact with reality provisionally.
But not all people develop psychosis.
There appears to be a genetic provision for schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that there are other determinants in addition to genes.
Researchers assume that the affected suffer minimal brain damage.
We suspect that the neuronal maturity of the brain is affected in an early stage of development, such as through a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But it remains an incognite how this alteration of the neuronal system occurs, which also does not manifest itself at all for many years.
Also the influence of the environment plays an important role - stress or traumatic experience can be the triggers of a psychosis when there is already a predisposition.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can cause psychosis, as they interfere with the transmitter system of the brain.
When the brain warms
The illogical thing about all this is that psychotic people suffer from their hallucinations and take very expensive drugs to get rid of them, while others pay for drugs that allow them to experience some, says the professor in psychology Erich Kasten, from Lübeck.
To perceive a hallucination as pleasant or not often depends on the point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and visions for ten years and has analyzed the results in the book Die unreale Welt in unserem Kopf (The Unreal World in Our Head), published last year.
Hallucinations are among the typical symptoms accompanying psychosis, but also, surprisingly, of many other diseases.
These include, along with psychological disorders such as personality boundary disorder or depressions, frequently also diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's and brain trauma.
surprisingly and under certain conditions, the brain of healthy people is also hallucinated.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, are composed of memories that are usually repressed.
They arise when the areas of the brain in which sensory perceptions are processed are hyperactive or poorly cohibited; when our brain is hot, but also when stimuli are lacking.
Drugs can cause this state in the same way as brain damage or psychosis.
But also the restriction of stimuli, stress, the evil of love, or other exceptional brain states.
In jüngeren Study gab bis zu einem Drittel der Befratten an, mindestens einmal im Leben eine Halluzination erlebt zu haben.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. was 16, living in a small town in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and attending a secondary school.
An ordinary girl.
If it wasn't for those pictures and voices.
Sometimes, during recess, a guy gets a long, dark-haired torpedoes his word.
When she answers, the other students look at her surprised; no one but her hears or sees the boy.
They think the shy girl is a bit strange dreamer, but Sarah K. You know she's not dreaming.
She's awake and she sees and listens to that guy, just as she sees and hears the girl sitting on the bench next door.
You may even feel your presence, at least a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, he likes the boy.
Sometimes you wonder if you're crazy.
He also knows that the boy and the rest of the visions are not real and disappear.
At night, appearances are alarming.
Visions are often a burden.
When he is in class sometimes he cannot follow the lesson because the teacher - in his eyes and ears - is presenting a new companion, while for the rest he explains mathematical equations in a visible and audible way.
At night, appearances are alarming.
While waiting in the dark room for sleep to come, which often comes late and is scarce, he cannot distinguish whether he is awake or dreaming, if the images he sees, the mussels or the girl with bleeding cuts in her arms and legs, appear in front of her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, yell at the figures.
Her parents and friends haven't told them anything, they'd think she's crazy.
In the fall of 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
He approved selectivity last year and lived with his boyfriend.
A year ago the hallucinations disappeared.
Since you've been in contact with psychologist Kasten over the Internet, you know he's not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art for despair.
According to Kasten, when a person is socially isolated or suffers from a restriction of stimuli, it is very likely that after a time he begins to have hallucinations.
I think the brain is unoccupied and is in charge of looking for entertainment.
Sarah K., a single daughter, was afraid of the other children and often played alone.
His hallucinations began when, at the age of 13, he learned that the man he calls dad since he has used reason is not his biological father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same areas of the brain that also process real impressions and noises, those affected as Sarah K. It is difficult for them to distinguish between visions and reality. “Every experience,” says Kasten, “has place in the brain, reality is projected there.
Hallucinations are equally images that the brain produces, so they seem so real -
Kasten also classifies nighttime fantasies as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people do not differ in the fundamentals of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, psychically healthy people are able to recognize their visions as unreal.
Kasten therefore recommends that his patients appreciate his hallucinations as a special skill.
Limit situation between sleep and hallucination
in this world too focused on the conscious, imaginary experiences usually become pathologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief physician of the psychiatric and psychotherapy clinic of the Florence-Nightingale-Krankenhauses hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a harsh and painful disease but it also involves something positive and creative - madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has investigated so-called oneirism, a special form of consciousness, which is perceived as a dream.
Onirical hallucinations are almost very complex and detailed dreams that the person who experiences them considers real and subsequently cannot differentiate from being awake.
Onyric conscious states arise in extreme situations associated with trauma or disease, for example in patients with polyradiculoneuropatia, who experience a motor paralysis being fully aware. die bei vollem Bewustsein eine motorische Lähmung erleben.
According to Schmidt-Degenhardt, when a person is threatened by a loss of self or the world due to a total and permanent motor disability, it replaces a very dangerous real situation with a self-real and imaginary world that is uncoupled from reality.
A form of boundary situation between sleep and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome a situation in reality, there is a change in the world, although the real situation remains present in the imagination.
An intensive way of giving meaning and interpretation to an unattainable situation in itself that our own capacity of creation allows us not to sink into nothing of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
Also art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen, from Zurich, describes his dream experiences in his book Herzenwechsel as an action to save the soul.
He was 49 years old when his consciousness embarked on several-day travels following an operation of heart valves with heart transplantation included, while his body was doomed to immobility at the intensive care station.
Claussen plunged into a world created by it and visited strange places of other times: he saw himself laid down in bed, an older man aboard a sanatorium on a train, a robot veiled for his health.
It was seen in the high Middle Ages, surrounded by nobles who produced narcotics from blood.
A Greek on a motorcycle kidnapped him in his home country, surfed his hospital bed in the Alps with snow fern and met a Korean mobster.
It gives everything in these imaginary facts, everything is real, even later in memories.
For Claussen, these interior trips are fundamentally different from any dream.
Dreaming is a different state, thus describing your experience.
On the contrary, the memories of mental travel are, many years later, much clearer, even in the irrelevant details.
More clear and intensive even than real experiences.
The intensity of this experience dilutes the horizon of the rest of our daily experiences, adds psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, oneirism, psychosis, hallucinations, and drug use show how fragile the inner reproduction of outer reality is, even when we are awake.
Every change in the state of consciousness, summarizes psychologist Kasten, \"can lead to a deformation of what we call reality\"
An experience that, on the other hand, can be completely enriching.
The snow can come
Burda
Children will take over the editorial at age 27
The new editor Kallen has come to an interim solution: Hubert Burda wants to leave his company in the future in the hands of his two children, commented to SPIEGEL.
100% of the holding will also be in the family's hands.
Hamburg - The editor Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the future.
The two children become heirs at age 27 and have the firm will to enter the company, confirmed Burda, 69, to SPIEGEL.
Details have been arranged as a precautionary measure.
The next question is whether they will actively participate in the company.
Also, if they are qualified for it.
One cannot put 7,500 workers ahead of their children, if they are not trained enough to do so.
That would end up with the children and also with the company.
Burda announced on Thursday that he will withdraw from the presidency of the Board of Directors from January and that Paul-Bernhard Kallen has been appointed his successor.
This member of the Kallen family, of 52, has been a member of Burda's management since 1999.
At first he was responsible for technology.
Later, he took charge of the treasury and thus became responsible for the company's assets. After the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer he also took charge of direct marketing, foreign, printing and finance.
For the first time, no member of the family occupies the epistle of the editorial.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old. His son Felix, now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
Kallen's designation also serves to save the differences of 10, 15 years, according to Burda.
100% of the holding will also be in the family's hands.
Looking at the Schickedanz and Schaeffle cases, Burda stated that family businesses are not safe from decay: “This has always affected families who get infected by the capital search interest, who have misjudged and thought that they could rise up as well as the biggest player.
That's never been my strategy.
I've never had - deliriums of greatness - says Burda.
I don't see myself as a political preceptor of this country, as Springer was, and I don't want to play with the \"Time\" in the world league; these businesses have become too big.
Integral beauty
Anything - in the matter of beauty and well-being - you can wish, within the reach of your hand.
This is what seems to have been proposed The English Court, which has just inaugurated in the shopping center of Callao (Madrid) a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2 dedicated to the care and mime of the body.
The spa, located on the octave plant, has prestigious signatures such as Hedonai - which is responsible for laser depilation-; Spaxion, with relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments; Luis & Tachi peluqueros; Marina d'Or, which has a gymnasium, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a feeding section, where the teapot stands out, with more than 130 classes other than this infusion.
Enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner as you contemplate the best views of the capital, or rent for two hours the relaxation area to mount your own 'beauty party' with eight of your friends and relax with a jacuzzi session, massages and taking a glass of champagne are some of the possibilities that Spaxion offers.
In total there are 250 m2 distributed in 12 rooms to perform the latest and newest facial, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
Like, for example, cavitation to combat cellulitis or vibratory platforms.
The gym also has these machines, in addition to virtual 'trainers' that guide the customer steps, offering them a fully personalized treatment.
It all starts by entering your personal key into a touch screen, located in front of the machine.
Then, several videos show us how to properly perform our exercise table.
Your director assures that 15 minutes (including heating and stretching) are sufficient to exercise all the muscles of the body.
And if after exercising our body, we want to go through hairdressing, Luis & Tachi has a room where rituals of hair recovery, luminosity or nutrition are offered in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the premises of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year, from 10:00 am to 22:00 pm at night.
Miscellaneous Scouts
Christmas approaches and is never going to review the look of the stars to adapt them to our party costume.
The shape of the hatch, very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the variables that we must take into account.
There are a few suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated score. It is not very advisable.
Endesa and Barcelona, with electric car
The electric company Endesa, together with the City Council of Barcelona, created the 'LIVE Office'.
It is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The 'LIVE Office' (Logistics for the Installation of Electric Vehicle) will define and coordinate the road map for the implementation of the electric car in the city and will reach agreements on mobility, managing, coordinating, submitting subsidies, etc.
On the other hand, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
Finally, the aim is to promote what will be the transport of the future.
3 'Electrical Cities'
But Barcelona is not the only city to be involved in the implementation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville joined the project.
It is the three cities elected by the Government, within the MOVELE Plan, to promote the deployment of the electric vehicle.
The electric company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat de Cataluña.
This aims to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These would include energy-related activities, in particular energy efficiency.
It is not the only initiative in which Endesa participates in promoting the electric vehicle.
The company participates in standardization groups at European level and has assets of a number of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees 'a horizon of tranquility' for the engine sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, glimpses - a horizon of tranquility - for the Spanish automotive industry, which, he recalled, is the country's main exporting sector.
In the presentation of the Economic Report of the President of the Government for 2009, Zapatero reviewed the measures that the Executive has undertaken throughout the period to support the automotive sector.
\"Without the Automotive Competitiveness Plan, today we would have an overview of the abandonment, of the closure of some of our major productive plants,\" said the President of the Government.
- Thanks to this plan and at the disposal of the brands to follow in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can have a horizon of tranquility for the future of this industry, which is our main exporting sector, added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Integral Automotive Plan (PIA), allocated 800 million to 19 manufacturers and 137 ancillary companies, which mobilized an investment of more than 3 billion euros.
The Chief of Executive explained that this investment was committed both to the development of new models and to the modernization of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also emphasized government demand support measures, in reference to Plan 2000E, implemented in collaboration with autonomous communities and automotive brands.
According to the president, this plan has allowed the average emissions of new vehicles marketed on the Spanish market to be reduced by 6% and has led to a \"strong increase\" in registrations, which grew by 40 percent in November.
20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
The first edition of the International Classic Vehicle Hall will be held in Madrid, a meeting space for professionals and fans of the motor world.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Cristal Pavilion of the Casa de Campo de Madrid.
This is an exhibition area of 20,000 square metres, where there will be more than 200 national and international exhibitors.
Not only motorcycles and classic cars can be found, but ClassicAuto Madrid will find items of all kinds related to the world of the engine.
Thus, among the exhibitors of the pavilion, accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures, etc. can be found.
Hundreds of items related to the world of the classic motor that will make the delights of collectors and curious.
Among the participating companies you will find, among others, Mos and Good Old Times Classics, sale of cars; Juan Lumbreras, restoration; Coupe-Francisco Pueche sale and restoration of automobiles; or Cochera Classics, specialist Mercedes Benz.
Exterior Skill Tests
In addition, the commercial activity of this Hall will be complemented by parallel activities: holding concentrations, sporting exhibitions, skill tests, presentations and contests.
Skill tests will also be carried out with classic cars and motorcycles in a circuit enabled outside the ferial enclosure.
Mazda3 i-Stop: sustainable sports
Mazda wants to show that sports are not denied respect for the environment.
Therefore, it has just incorporated into Mazda3 the engine stop and start-up system - named i-Stop-, a device that at least for the moment is only available with the gasoline 2.0 engine with 150 horses.
This second generation of Mazda3 stands out for the good note achieved throughout it.
The finishings, the termination of the vehicle, the habitability, the behavior, the mechanics, the i-Stop system...
All these aspects are outstanding in the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driving station, we check that the front buttocks have excellent ergonomics and subjection.
The touch of the steering wheel is also exquisite.
Continuing with the set formed by the instrument picture and the console we see as Mazda has continued the Japanese trend of creating a futuristic interior design, with many buttons and controls and striking colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of the one presented also by the Honda Civic.
Therefore, we can say that both Mazda3 and Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and more specifically the Volkswagen Golf, to which everyone wants to beat.
Continuing with the habitat, this compact Japanese has a habitability more than enough for four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
All this adds to a large trunk with regular forms.
The automatic engine stop and start-up system, at least for the moment, is only available with the gasoline engine of two liters and 150 horses and with the manual change of six gears.
This engine is a real delight. It is outstanding for its fineness, for its low noise, for its benefits and for achieving its contained consumption.
And it is that even though the most demanded Mazda3 will be the diesel versions, those who do not perform a high number of kilometres a year should not discard this i-Stop with gasoline engine, both for their high walking comfort, and for their content consumption.
Regarding the equipment level, the version chosen for the test is called Sportive, i.e. it incorporates a larger number of serial elements.
Of the series equipment, the rail change assistant (RVM) which removes the dead angle, the traction and stability controls, speed control, the photosensitible interior mirror, the onboard computer on a large screen, the parking sensors, independent air conditioning, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and bluetooth audio and 17-inch alloy wheels are especially highlighted.
In addition, on its own little equipment, this version had the Premium Pack, which adds for 1,500 euros: bingeon adaptive headlights and BOSE sound system with disc charger, among other elements.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compacts in the category.
It is particularly important for the quality of the materials used, their behaviour and the high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not perform many kilometres a year will be able to choose this i-Stop version, associated only with the gasoline 2.0 engine of 150 horses.
The only drawback of this model is its high price, which is between 21,770 euros of the Luxury finish and 23,270 euros of the proven version - Sports-.
In exchange for this high figure, Mazda3 will offer us large doses of satisfaction every day.
Luxury 'first'
L. A. covers the red carpet of sensuality of the hand of Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars shone more than ever, wrapped in models as elegant as 'sexys' on the premiere of 'Nine'. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our 'Pe', as sophisticated as usual, chose a dark 'lady'.
FonPeek's promise
Peek is extremely limited, a device that only serves to look at mail, without even being able to see certain types of attachments or browse the network.
He enjoyed his five-minute fame in the U.S. when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
Seeing him on the street is more difficult, the truth, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek has a very low price and a very low monthly fee, less than half of what is paid, for example, by the iPhone data plan.
Given the success the company has taken out two new devices: one exclusively designed for Twitter, the other with a free life data service in exchange for paying six times more for Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It's as limited as your American counterpart, but it comes with a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price, from about 12 euros per month, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone already know what it is to give up the data when crossing the border or desperately looking for a WiFi cafeteria (or a Fon connection) to be able to check out the mail.
The idea of fixed price roaming is incredibly attractive and long ago it would have to be in operation.
Yes, some operators have special agreements and travel plans, but in my experience it takes a doctorate in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the small letter.
The European Commission's repeated ear pulleys to achieve affordable roaming rates across Europe have hardly had a perceptible effect.
Outside of the country of origin there is a fear of using the data, and rightly so.
That an apparatus like FonPeek (not to be confused with the name Fon when it is not Wifi) gets this kind of fares means that operators start thinking differently and study different proposals with which to amortize their data network.
Kindle is another good example, including book download traffic and other Internet queries.
No contracts and no gaitas.
It is a connected device and it is paid for when buying it, not every month.
And that's what I hope to see someday with FonPeek, an option to buy with life access like the one Peek already has in the U.S.
Not because I'm going to buy it.
I look at my email on the phone, thank you.
I hope so because I think it's a fairer model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with this same system.
The fetish color of Michelle
The yellow is undoubtedly the favorite tone of the first American lady.
If he has already gone to Barack Obama's possession as president of the United States with a dress and coat of this color, he has chosen the same to accompany him in, no doubt, the second most important moment of his life: the collection in Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama has taken a very similar model on both occasions: in addition to being a similar color - greenish yellow with bright reflections - the two times the outfit consisted of three pieces - clothed, jacket and coat of the same cloth - and was adorned with a large embroidery or necklace.
So much so, that at first glance it seemed that the first lady in the United States was following the star of the Princess of Asturias and had chosen to repeat the Vestaurium.
But the fabric in which the two suits are made makes them very different.
If for possession of a fat lace treated, in Oslo it is a velvet with stamped.
The accessories have also varied: green shoes half heel the other time, and a similar model, but in gold, now.
And equally different is the hairstyle: one picked up on this occasion, melena dropped the previous one.
75 per cent of working mothers have had labor problems because of their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of younger generations who want to be mothers.
This is revealed by the study 'Fecundity and career of women in Spain', developed by the CSIC in collaboration with the Women's Institute.
The survey conducted between 9,737 women aged 15 and 75 leaves no doubt about it: 75 per cent of working mothers have seen limited opportunities in the workplace due to maternity.
The study points out that there are many differences in the start of cohabitation in couples and the number of children, depending on whether they work or not and the type of work they develop.
Those who do not have an out-of-home activity, work part-time, or have a non-steady job, begin first cohabitation in marriage, advance first motherhood, and have more children.
On the contrary, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, delay coexistence and maternity, and have less offspring.
The women between 35 and 49 years of age with fixed work have the first child, on average, 3.7 years after the start of life, a figure that increases to 4.1 women with fixed jobs has taken longer of their vital path to achieve them, which has led them to postpone the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of work performed exerts a great deal of influence on motherhood, although less on the mating schedule, explains the researcher of CSIC Margarita Delgado.
The level of study is another factor that differentiates the age of women when they marry and have the first stroke.
According to the survey, the higher the educational level, the older the age they marry and the one the first child has.
The difference is also maintained among women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49-year-old group, those with elementary and higher studies have been mothers for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 respectively.
In addition, another division is established among women according to their level of study.
While those with elementary studies marry and have their first child before they get a stable job, those at medium or higher levels invest this sequence and give priority to obtaining a stable job as a condition prior to marriage and the arrival of a child - details Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to his envious list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year on, the German actress will become the image of different brand products, coinciding the universal motto of 'Because I am worth it'.
The protagonist of 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most elegant actresses in the international landscape, joins other famous records of L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter such a select club were the actresses Evangeline Lilly ('Londidos') and Freida Pinto ('Slumdog Millonaire').
In the male section, the cosmetic brand also has luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ('Grey Anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's companion in 'Lost').
British Fashion Awards
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
His highest representatives - designers and models, yesterday and today - met in the annual delivery of their awards, held in London, at the Royal Court os Justice.
No one was missing on the date.
The former Jerry Hall model and her daughter, Georgia May Jagger, chosen Best Model of the Year.
The Poker of Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent presents in 'Póquer de aces' (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) a thirty-tenth of X-rays by writers who have spent their literary life (and, in cases, also by the other).
It does not do so in the predictable and fearsome genres (biographical similarity, life and work), but rather looking for something similar to the ignition core of the creator character.
The trip has its excitations and Vicent does not save fears or lighting.
In addition to an exquisite pleasure, the book is a touching invitation to readings and readings.
Here I'll give you some snapshots.
About Albert Camus: \"In his pages I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical, pulse, the same as I felt without name: the pleasure against the acigo destiny, the guiltless moral and innocence without any god\"
About Samuel Beckett: “Nihilistic, allegorical Christian, wrote what was in the blood, not in the intellect, between impotence and ignorance, with a stunning poetic humor, without meaning, like the blade of the knife that was about to kill him.”
About Graham Greene: \"Our man was abducted by this woman with a passion that lasted thirteen years, in whose flesh combined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that was to reach the sky through the path of destruction\"
About James Joyce: - The 'Ulises' was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the tops of eight thousand meters of universal literature, which must be climbed through the north wall, from which the best mountaineers take off again and again -
About William Faulkner: “He was a weird guy.
On his own, he sometimes said that he was the heir of a county landlord and others who was the son of a black man and a crocodile.
Both dreams were of greatness -
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: “This writer picked up the demented cry from a bridge by that character of Munich to take his echo to the bottom of the 20th century in its literary form and did it on a journey fleeing from himself and calling for posterity with a violent speech to the worms”
About Dorothy Parker: \"One day she got on her knees and prayed: 'Dear God, I beg you to stop writing like a woman.\"
About Joseph Conrad: \"On his grave these verses of Spenser were recorded: 'The sleep after effort,/ after storm the port,/ rest after war,/ after hard life pleases death -
About Virginia Wolf: \"The luggage also brought their depressions.

The case of a man so patient and in love with a neurotic man whose literary talent was in front of his madness has never been given.
About Pío Baroja: \"What did Martín-Santos do but try to inoculate Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet try but to pass Baroja through Faulkner's weapons?
What did Cella do but abduct that man's fame to serve him as his own pedestal -
Coward aggression
Last week, my mother, about 70 years old, walked through our neighborhood in the municipality of Fuenlabrada when a group of 15 to 18-year-olds passed by her and our dog, a sample of mixed race, rescued from the dog and with no more than six pounds of weight and, without a word, propped two kicks that left the dog maltreated.
Our outrage is capital because we do not find the fun in a free aggression to a small, helpless animal, which, by the way, was tied up.
To this we must add the suffocation that provoked a woman who walked quietly and who, when she enrolled these individuals, came to fear for her physical integrity, as an energetic attack on an animal, is able to do her own thing with a woman, a child, an old person or, ultimately, with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The event occurred at five o'clock on a Tuesday, any one for a traditionally quiet neighborhood.
The dog was crying all day.
By the way, we made a complaint in a nearby police station that we doubt that it would do much and not generate susceptibility, just clarifying that the murderous cowards were Spanish.
The outrage has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand that it is happening among young people that they consider it fun to abuse a defenseless animal for free that gives us affection, company and friendship.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people have remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together for helmet use
The manufacturer of Michelin tires, with the collaboration of the Spanish Road Safety Foundation (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote the use of helmets, mainly among the younger drivers, reported both entities today.
This initiative seeks to raise awareness of the importance of using the helmet, as it is the only protection element capable of avoiding head injury or even death in the event of an accident while on a motorcycle.
Michelin indicated that this campaign is part of his commitment to road safety, which goes beyond designing and manufacturing safer products every day, and stated that he also contributes to this goal through other actions of a pedagogical and informative nature.
This new campaign to promote helmet use on the motorcycle, under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will have a first phase in which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle workshops, with the aim of achieving maximum diffusion.
Finally, Michelin pointed out that road safety - it is a constant concern - for the company, since as a tyre manufacturer for two-wheel vehicles, one of its main purposes is to develop increasingly safe products.
Sale of light commercials
Almost two years later, the light commercial vehicle market begins to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 units registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12,6 per cent compared to 2008 and, most importantly, represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of declines, according to figures from the employers of the manufacturers Anfaf and that of the sellers Ganvam.
The good data, not ostentatious, should be put in quarantine as the reference to which the comparison was made - November 2008 - was particularly bad, with a decrease of 60% compared to the previous year.
As a result of this, despite the repellent of the last month, the enrolments accumulated in these 11 months are 40% below those in the previous year.
Since January 95,853 units have been sold together all the vehicles that make up the tailor drawer of light commercials: from tourism, pick up, vans, light vans and trucks/light chassis.
Nor have the nubarrons that affect their demand disappeared, since although they are also acquired by private individuals, most of the purchases are made by small and medium-sized companies, which pay in almost 100 per cent of the cases through external financing.
So that the restrictions on the closure of bank credits must be added to other factors such as the increase in unemployment levels or the persistence of the poor economic situation.
In view of this scenario and unlike tourism, aid to the 2000E purchase has recently been provided.
In addition to individuals, self-employed persons and SMEs who are going to purchase a light commercial of up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emission level not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre, the number of operations has been witnessed.
Yesterday, since Ganvam again remembered the need to devote special attention by the Administration to these vehicles and also to industrialists (cars and buses).
The association of sellers predicts a 2010 similar to the year that ends, for which it calculates a fall in sales (of tourism and 4x4) of 19%.
Emergency braking aid is already mandatory
As was the case with the ABS brake antilock and will pass with the ESP stability control, emergency braking aid systems will have to be a mandatory element in European cars.
In fact, this is already the case for all new registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for the rest, a period of deficiency is fixed until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to increase pedestrian protection although, by its way of work, it can also help to avoid many collisions in scope.
The emergency braking assistant does what he does is to increase the pressure on the brakes in case of an emergency, which the system detects by the driver's treadmill.
But this one doesn't always keep that pressure to the end.
According to a study carried out by the manufacturer of components for Bosch car, the third part of the drivers involved in an accident had not been able to step the brake before the collision and half of them did not take full advantage of the force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, on the other hand, requires the maximum braking system, reducing the distance the car uses to stop.
According to a study by the EU itself, if all cars were equipped with such elements, they could be avoided by the year up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians.
The reduction will be even greater - it is estimated that one out of every four sinisters would be avoided with damage to people - when the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems are popularized.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that (through a radar or a camera) detects the obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it helps to increase pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
In case it does not react, and even if the collision is inevitable, the device exerts maximum effort on brakes to minimize damage.
General Motors delays until January the plan for Opel
While Opel's plant workers in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been notified by Nick Reilly, the new President of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April - the 8th day probably - according to Javier Ortega, the American manufacturer warns that it will need more time to complete the recovery plan for Opel.
What Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, wants is that each of the points in the plan has been previously agreed by the affected party.
And this can cause the final document that will be submitted to the workers first and then to the Governments of the countries where there are factories, to be delayed until the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, from GM it is assured that a decision on the sale of Saab should be made in the next few days.
It is no wonder that the Swedish Government has increased pressure on the US manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to having contact with some potential new buyers.
One of them might be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but it cobras force the option of the Dutch manufacturer of Skyper sports cars, which is backed by the Russian group Converg.
If there was no agreement with any of them, GM could sell some Saab assets to China's Baic.
The decision to close Saab is maintained at the end of the year if it is not sold.
To the Porsche Boxster Spyder steering wheel
To unwind its last, and face-to-face, Porsche engineers took the Boxster S as a base and made it slimming up no less than 80 kilos, leaving the scale in only 1.275 kilos.
This led them to dispense, first of all, with the automatic roof that has been supplied by one of the canvas with manual drive, with which they save 21 kilos; using aluminum doors like those of the GT3, 'casen' other 15; removing the air conditioning, 13; reducing the fuel tank from 64 to 54 liters, they won 7 pounds more; mounting other 12 sports baccets and with the light wheels of 19 inches, five.
Finally, renouncing the CDR-30 audio system brought another six kilograms and changing the door handles for some of the remaining canvas.
Although it is also offered with the dual clutch PDK change, the test was carried out on a unit with the six-speed manual box, mainly on secondary roads in California, in mountain sections with really twisted traces
Your behavior can only qualify as untouchable.
Weight reduction does not imply that the car does not step the asphalt with aplom.
Rather, the opposite: it was a long time ago that we did not test such a small and light model that, at the same time, transmitted so much safety in the curve step, even at high speeds.
He is a small athlete, able to heat his muscles in a short march for as long as necessary, until we order him to squeeze, brake, recover and re-express his motor...
What we ask of you. Thanks to your direction, as communicative as you need, what we indicate with our hands on the wheel is what the car will do.
And he'll do it with surgical accuracy.
Sound of the engine at will
The sound of your V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is very successful and can be enhanced with the option 'sport' and through a system that modifies the engine's giggling, already debuted previously in the Panamera.
The ability to accelerate is brutal, whether from standstill or in recovery.
Suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the roads we went through with the Boxster Spyder was quite punished, but the car digested the basins well.
E-aids barely made an act of presence throughout the journey; and that is that in one of the curves we find ice at dawn and gravel, already entered the morning.
Ultimately, an ultralight car, of the most fun driving that one can on the market and that is more than just a modification of Boxster S.
The car will be offered for sale in February 2010, with a price of 70,831 euros.
\"Bag Girl\"
Intimacy of Karl lagerfeld, image of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional Starlette of the parades of the 'house', the singer prodigies her face of malata with as much contumacy as her Chanel pockets.
More than 'Bad Girl' or 'It Girl', it's a 'Bag Girl'.
A victory is given in Israel by Baskonia
The Caja Laboral achieved a brilliant triumph for 82-91 in his visit to the complicated Maccabi Electra court, despite the numerous casualties with which Dusko Ivanovic's team counted, and in this way sits in the leadership of his group, after Mirza Teletovic's great performance, which with eight triples scored was the best of his team (29 ratings).
The Victorian team was able to supply the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with large doses of involvement and collective work even though it had to suffer to the end to do with victory.
In addition, the great hit from the perimeter, with 16 triple annotated had much to do with the final triumph.
The match started face to face for the blues, which were put from the beginning forward in the marker.
That the first four baskets of the Victorians were out of the perimeter already pretended to have jumped into the Israeli range with the hot dolls.
English and Teletovic were the main artists of 18-20 at the end of the first part.
The second room was more than the same, but the alavian team opted for the inner game of Barak and the work of Elijahhu, which was received with feathers and applause on the return to which was his home, to continue extending its advantage to rest (34-43).
Teletovic had already begun to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, although the 'less six' of Splitter's valuation already made it appear that this was not to be the best night of the Brazilian.
But the party, despite being in charge of rest, was not determined much less and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Victorians that in their court no one wins, and with \"Elijah's hand\" they managed to get into the party.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the return of the yellows to the light (50-49).
More drawbacks
Those of Ivanovic, injured but not much dead, needed to play a couple of games right to catch air, and in those arrived Mirza Teletovic's machine gun, which with three triples almost consecutive and the help of English and Ribas returned the marker to a soothing rent (54-67), which managed to make the premises at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The ladies left the skin in the last partial and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already warned that they would not let anyone take what they deserved during the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team did not resign and tried to keep their team alive from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated by faults, Ivanovic's did not rush, defended well, and although the Israelis approached in the final minute (80-85), the party already owned and the victory escaped from Tel Aviv for the first time in the season.
Injury prevents the Unicaja from fighting
The Unicaja lost sharply in Greece before the Olympics and gave him the leadership of Group B of Euroliga, in a party marked by the downfalls of cashiers, especially in the internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated Greek victory.
The Malagasy team was not frightened by the atmosphere of the Peace and Friendship pavilion and also by the rival entity, perhaps the most powerful in Europe and with a great budget.
The game shown in the first room made it possible to dream of the Andalusians. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two of Omar Cook's base and one of Guillem Rubio's, unveiled the locals 12-18, minute 9.
The Olympiacs was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja , although the arsenal of the locals in the indoor game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, turned to the marker 22-20, minute 13, when an action, conato de combata, between the two U.S. bases Beverley and Williams, assumed the disqualification of both players.
The Greek set began to function by showing its superiority within both areas, where the downfall by injury of the English pivot Joel Freeland and the three personal faults of Carlos Jiménez, were barking the cashiers.
Between the internal players and the Lithuanian allero Linas Kleizas, with its triples, increased the advantage 44-32, minute 19.
Impossible magnifier
The third period was very offensive to the Olympiacs, who, despite the 19 losses, showed himself superior and even came to equal the difference of the meeting disputed in Malaga 66-48, minute 27, which made the group's leadership staggered.
The Unicaja was trying to overcome the absences and the last drop of the Scottish Pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the meeting.
Despite all the inconveniences the Unicaja for Cook's direction and triples, and Lewis' contribution, left some hope 66-57, minute 31.
But it was practically impossible because the Olympiacs when he tightened and gave his superiority in centimeters within the area was unstoppable.
The Croatian peacock Nikola Vujcic managed to climb the basketball average 81-62, minute 37, and the Unicaja turned off, delivering leadership to the Olympiacs.
How much should you charge for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they deserve according to their profile, thanks to a new application of Trovit, the searcher with the highest number of classified real estate ads, employment and motor in Spain.
The tool How much should you charge? calculates the user's wages from the more than 140,000 job offers available to Trovit in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where they must enter their profession, years of experience, age and city where they want to work.
In the week that the application is in operation, the researcher has detected that in general the Spanish worker - feeling poorly paid - explained in a statement the product manager of Trovit, Albert Ribera.
According to the data available to Trovit of its seekers in the UK and France, the Spanish are the worst paid.
A British computer programmer charges EUR 45,226 per year and a French one, 31,059, compared to the 24,000 who receive a Spanish.
Similarly, a driver charges 34,247 euros annual nets in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid job in Spain is that of waiter, with 11,592 euros each year net; followed by the employee, with 14,725 euros; and the worker, with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the network in the last three months are that of driver, half-day jobs and that of social workers.
Brazil sets dates to the exit of Zelaya
The Brazilian Government has put an end to Manuel Zelaya's stay at his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed chairman shall leave diplomatic legation by 27 January 2010 at the latest when he or she formally concludes his term of office.
Francisco Catunda, head of business of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that \"Mel\" knows that he must leave before that date of the embassy, where he has remained a refugee since 21 September.
\"He is aware that he has to leave on 27 January, at the end of his term of office, he has to look for another destination.\"
The station also quoted the former agent, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline established: \"My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government,\" Zelaya declared by telephone.
After the 29 November elections (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, this same week he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation was finally frustrated by the rejection of Zelaya of the condition of political asylum that the government, in fact, was trying to impose on him by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much.
After the days of wine and roses since the past spring in which the inflation of assets has been the dominant tonic in the markets, again uncertainty reappears in the markets, which should not be surprising as it is its natural state, in an environment where agents make decisions about the future by uncertain nature.
The medicine used by central banks to stabilize markets was to borrow debt with direct purchase of assets and indirectly giving liquidity-free bar to types close to zero for financial institutions to buy discount assets.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have practically ended and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, they start to throw some sand into the gears as the ECB did with its auction next week's year.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without such heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reversal of risk reduction.
The volatility of the stock exchanges and the differentials of corporate bonds have rebounded, although they remain far away from the paranormal levels they reached earlier in the year.
States were forced to socialize private risk and public debt was again affected.
Once again, there is a quality flight and the US, Japan and Germany have been the refuge chosen by investors, causing an expansion of the eurozone countries' differentials with regard to Germany.
Spain had hardly been affected by this episode of instability but in that came Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new review to the downgrade of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty does not come wrong to accommodate moral risk advocates who were again trying to raise awareness about those responsible for world economic policy for having curbed the destructive effects of the restriction of credit on the destruction of employment, when what should be done is to decree a new day of Thanksgiving.
However, Dubai's paints a tribal struggle between the emies to recompose power in the emirates and the one in Greece we have seen before.
A government that conceals public deficits, elections and a new government that pulls out of the blanket.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and to allow a euro Member State to fail to fulfil its commitments.
What makes sense is that the Ecofin has forced the Greek Government to be transparent and to make its citizens accountable for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expect, we are faced with an episode of normalization of transitional risk premiums, after some excesses in leveraged positions, it would be within the expected.
In the Spanish case, while our public debt differentials expand as well as European corporate bonds we should not worry.
If European differentials decrease and ours continue to expand, then it would be a Spanish idiosyncratic risk.
Standard & Poor's is an anecdote. When our advanced indicators are forcing the majority of study services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and to review their scenario for 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, to return to the burden with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy does not wish much hope of life to their warning.
Again, it looks like it will be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although at the moment - prudence, driver friend -

The president of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene yesterday before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies in which Spain's energy strategy is discussed these days in the next two decades.
After his speech, followed by the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press a few brushes of what he had put in the closed-door subcommission.
For the President of Iberdola, Spain needs to invest 50,000 million euros by 2020 and another 60 billion between that date and 2030, provided that nuclear power plants are kept open today.
Otherwise, the necessary investments will not be 60 billion, but up to 95,000 million.
Iberdrola believes that in the next decade, investments should not be aimed at building capacity, but at distribution networks and international interconnections.
As of 2020, the issue will change and the power will have to be increased.
Its bet focuses on both gas and coal plants with carbon dioxide capture mechanisms and, above all, renewable energies.
In this case, it considers that 18,000 MW are needed, that is, with other — support energies —
Galán, who believes that the draft Sustainable Economy Act that has just been passed by the Government is in line with what his company has been claiming, did not want to make blood with the real decree to encourage the consumption of national coal, which contradicts climate change policies.
In his view, there is a clear long-term bet in this respect, despite the “point” measures, as the President of Iberdrola called them.
Whatever the case, Galan considers that investment decisions, although long-term, should be taken as they are already taking time to mature and a stable pay framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial wins Aer Lingus' handing at ten airports
The Ferrovial subsidiary for ground airport services, Switzerland Swissport, will play the role of preferred partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for cargo services at ten European airports in which it has presence.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are some of the most outstanding.
The agreement, which has not exceeded the economic terms, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Castilla-La Mancha Board and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a collaborative protocol to create the Intelligent Infrastructure Innovation Centre
The alliance envisages an investment of 20 million to 2012, of which 50% corresponds to Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the centre will be to investigate energy efficiency in motorways and airports.
He fights his first highway in Australia with Hochtief and Bouygues
Activa stabs for its first concession highway in Australia, a market in which already works as an energy company and water manager.
The work at stake is that of a tunnel valued at 1,700 million Australian dollars (about 1,047 million euros).
The French Bouygues and Sister Hochtief are their rivals.
A 5-kilometre tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the nearest option for Actia to settle in the country as a highway builder and concessionaire.
The City Council wants to have it ready by the end of 2014
After opting for public-private collaboration (PPP) for its English acronyms to move forward the project, in a business plan protected by Erns & Young, the Administration already has a final list of candidates to do with the work and exploit the toll.
Pending the submission of their bids next May, the planned investment amounts to $1.7 billion in Australia (EUR 1.047 million) and in the final phase compete three consortia with notable presence of European manufacturers.
The group baptized as Transcity is led by Actia, the only Spanish in liza, and their companions are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian builders, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the largest specialists in underground works in Europe.
Against the Actia team plays the Northern Direct consortium, with the presence of the British Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French Bouygues group.
The third and final consortium that has passed the crypt is called LBRJV, where they share the capital of the Australian Leighton (philial of the German builder Hochtief, in turn participated by ACS), the local Baulderstone (proprietation of the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the signature gala specializing in civil work Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises great works and privatisations, but it involves a clear difficulty of entry if it is not through the acquisition of a local construction firm.
A strategy that has followed the so-called Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and which continues to be a pending subject for the Spanish giants in the sector.
Only ACS has achieved a position in that market through its 30% participation in Hochtief, owner of the so-called Leighton.
Millionary assets
It is committed to a geographical area of the highest importance for the sector, in which it already has a prominent presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the business of desalination.
Among other assets, it has its largest wind park, the Wauvra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the group of companies responsible for raising and managing the Adelaide derailer, with a budget of 700 million.
Its intention now is to consolidate these two areas and exploit synergies to enter the construction and operation fields of infrastructure.
The underground toll route, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and called Northern Link (northern link), is called to join the western Toowong highway with the bypass road in Kelvin Grove (see map) along 5 kilometres of tunnel. It is the biggest performance to reduce congestion in Brisbane traffic.
The schedule set by the Administration for the summer of 2010 and the start of the work in December of next year.
Although this payment step would open to traffic in the last months of 2014, the work is not expected to be completed until 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include two lanes per direction, electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Government of Queensland will contribute 500 million Australian dollars (EUR 308 million) to its financing.
Brisbane already offers business to Hochtief
Australia continues to bear remarkable fruit to Hochtief, who reported yesterday the conclusion of a contract with the Government valued at 154 million.
The participation of ACS will enable, through its local Leighton branch, the infrastructure of the national broadband network with fiber optic cable.
This performance will provide fast internet access to 400,000 people and will give work to the German for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has passed the construction project of the 27-storey King George Tower in the Australian city of Brisbane. The works were still to begin and Hochtief has closed the sale at 129 million.
Already in the UK, specifically in Manchester, you will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and operation of two schools for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its Alpine subsidiary, has been awarded the construction of a 2.1-kilometre long tunnel for a Slovenian motorway amounting to EUR 64.5 million.
The firm gets this contract days after it is done with the expansion works of the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) for 130 million.
In this way, Alpine reinforces its experience in tunnel construction.
The start of the work is scheduled for early 2010 and its implementation period will be extended for 32 months.
Ms. Rushmore awarded Renfe's publicity
Renfe has awarded advertising and marketing services for the next two years to the agency Mrs Rushmore for an amount of approximately three million euros per year, the railway operator has reported.
The contract contains the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Mrs. Rushmore has been elected from among the 16 agencies who presented themselves to the contest convened by Renfe of which four were finalists, including TBWA who was responsible for creativity in the last three years.
From now on, Mrs. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
A fine of 63 million to France Télécom for curbing competition
The competition regulator in France has imposed a fine of EUR 63 million on France Télécom for anticompetitive conduct in the Caribbean regions of the country.
According to this institution, the operator limited competition in fixed and mobile telephony with the signing of exclusive agreements, pricing plans and consumer loyalty programmes beyond regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state company accumulates more than 560 million euros in fines since 1994 for putting obstacles on its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday, in fact, has been increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar offences in the past and is therefore incidental.
Application Store
On the other hand, the French company’s mobile subsidiary has followed the star of other operators and has opened an Internet app store, with the aim of increasing revenues that do not come from voice transmission.
In principle, Orange's app store will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It will have to wait for 2010 to reach other countries, such as Spain.
Play the Champions has reported 476.4 million to Madrid and the Barça since its origin
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since its birth in 1992.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have entered 476.4 million since then, which makes them the third and fifth club that most money has won in the competition.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
Wining the UEFA Champions League not only provides glory, it is also one of the main sources of revenue of the big clubs.
So much so that the competition has allocated 5,362.5 million euros to the 105 teams (12 of them Spanish) who have participated in the event since the tournament was set up in the 1992/1993 season, according to data from UEFA.
The Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona have been well stopped from this division.
The white club has been the third of the continent that most money has been charged for participating, and the only one, along with AC Milan, who has won the trophy three times.
Catalan, the current champion and the last winner of the extinct European Cup in 1992, is the fifth of the rankings.
The list is led by Manchester United and the Bayern of Munich, the two teams who also paid more money for participating in the past Champions League.
And that, despite losing both in front of the Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country that has made the most money through the Champions, despite having achieved more titles than any other (five, by the four of Italy, the three of England and the two of Germany).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complicated money-sharing procedure applied by UEFA.
For this exercise, Michel Platini's agency plans to enter 1,090 million for the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA will spend 43.1 million on fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the previous round of classification (including the Madrid Atlético) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who were able to participate received 3.8 million just because they were there, in addition to another 550,000 euros for each party they dispute.
There are also bonuses to win (€800,000) and to tie (400,000 for each team). Eightfinalists will receive three million each; eight fourth-finalists, 3.3 million.
The last four will be charged 4 million each.
The champion will win 9 million, compared to 5.2 million of the finalist.
Thus, as a result of fixed payments, a club will enter at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
The Barça, on the other hand, was charged 2.5 million for winning Europe's Super Cup in August.
But there are also the variable payments, to which 337.8 million are allocated.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
Spanish is one of the main ones, and has four assigned places.
The champion of the previous year had 40 per cent of the money allocated, 30 per cent for the second, 20 per cent for the third and 10 per cent for the fourth.
The other party will be paid according to the number of parties played in this year's edition.
New Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% of Sos
The New Rumasa Group yesterday unbundled the details of the offer of purchase of shares with which it aims to acquire a top of between 25% and 29.9% of Sos' capital.
A percentage that does not oblige you to launch a public procurement offer (opa) for all securities.
In particular, New Rumasa offers EUR 1,5025 per share which would be disbursed in 10 years and which would be paid with an interest for the 1% annual deferral
Sos' shares closed at 1.85 euros yesterday; therefore, New Rumasa's offer values the company by 18% below the market.
According to New Rumasa, the price of €1,50 reflects the actual valuation of Sos.
The offer is conditional on the designation of eight of the 15 advisers.
The Jerezano group gives a 15-day deadline for shareholders to communicate their interest in selling securities.
CNMV made sure that it was not informed of the offer, despite the fact that the company of the Ruiz Mateos stated that it had contacted the regulator.
If it were to be done, the disbursement would amount to $611.7 million when the Sos capitalisation is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure his direction.
In an attempt to remain at the margins of possible offers of purchase and of the judicial vans of their former directors, the brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar, announced the election of Maria Luisa Jordá as director of internal audit.
A decision that makes it the first woman to hold a high position in the food company.
This is a newly created post that will depend directly on the chairman of the group.
And it is not free of controversy, as the company remains immersed in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of more than 230 million from Sos to Salazar societies.
In fact, it cannot be ruled out that over the next few months It reveals new diversions of funds
Regarding the credit to the Salazars, the former advisers Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) declared yesterday at the National Audience that they approved the diversion of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV authorises Paternina's opt-out that presented Investora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) authorized yesterday the opt-out presented by Investora Mer on Federico Paternina on 9 October.
The supervisory body has explained that it authorizes this operation by understanding that its terms are in accordance with the current rules and considers the content of the explanatory booklet submitted after the amendments introduced on 2 December.
CNMV has specified that the offer is aimed at the acquisition of 550,000.8 shares by Federico Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, representing 8.95% of its share capital, which is composed of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading in the Madrid and Bilbao Stock Exchanges.
It has also explained that 5,592,778 million shares have been immobilized, which cannot be transmitted in any way until the completion of the offer, of which it has specified that the price has been fixed by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the rules in force.
New tools for driving cars
In these days of times and accidents, not only do car workshops win.
Every day thousands of cars that have suffered a sinister are towed to a workshop, where an expert must assess the damage suffered and what the cost of repair will be.
No sinister is equal, and the calculation of the costs of parts and the working time can be a long and complicated work.
Manually calculate the cost of a repair of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including yam pieces, may take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest computer tools, it would be a minor issue.
Therefore, almost 100% of experts use these kinds of systems.
Service providers and solutions for the valuation of sinisters and maintenance are dedicated to collecting the information provided to them by manufacturers, then developing it and offering it to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the American Solera group, is the leading firm; 80% of the ratings are made with their products.
The other firms competing in the field of taxing and information processing tools on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
The work with the data supplied by manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, in Spain, they work with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them supplies the information in different formats.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, to the point that in the last five years there have been more versions, variants and motivations than in the previous fifteen.
As soon as a new car leaves the market, these companies get to work.
It is a very hard work, because you have to catalog each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle and enter its price.
In addition, a graphic, intelligent image is made of each model, where different parts of tourism can be painted.
If it is a window model, the work can be ready in a week if the process goes very fast.
If it is a minority car, it may take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information about 99.2% of cars that are marketed in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models are information about Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
As for the mobile park that runs, they exceed 99%.
To carry out the documentation work and the development of the databases, Audathex has eight world-wide centres (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them specializes in specific brands.
The national headquarters is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanical experts) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audadex invests EUR 90 million a year in developing these databases.
Every month 2.5 million data are included, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this huge flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and offer various products.
The most frequent use focuses on repair and maintenance, but according to which countries there are also tools for the management of debris parts or to calculate the venal or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that reports on the value of those used in Spain is Eurotax.
Audex does not offer it in our country, but in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support that professionals in the sector can provide.
This company offers ten different tools, being the star product AudaPlus, the standard solution for evaluation of sinisters, aimed at experts.
It includes cars, motorcycles and light or heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the paint bars.
This tool is paid according to use, for each valuation.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it little, a maximum of ten times a month.
Then every insurance company, which performs thousands of expertise, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it came out of the assembly line only with its building number.
AudaGlass focuses on the moons of vehicles, and AudaSubastas is an open service to the Internet professional sector that allows to upload by vehicles declared total sinister.
Its statistical service is very useful to identify trends, perform geodemographic analysis or know deviations by brands or models.
It can be studied, for example, how many models of a particular brand have passed through the workshop due to failures or how many have suffered serious sinisters over a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of these kinds of tools.
It deals, among others, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and also provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official times of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa group founded in 1971 as a service provider and compensation solutions for damage, damage or maintenance of the car
The Gt Taxation Guide is your historical reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its turnover has grown at an annual rate of 20% over the last three years, and in 2008 it has invoiced EUR 10.8 million.
In early last year, they began their internationalization process, with the installation of an office in Paris.
Audadex, for his part, was born in Germany in 1966 and was established in Spain in 1979.
According to sources of the company 62% of your business is generated in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. They work with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.
The global billing of the Solar Group (Audatex, Sidexa, Report ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach $557 million, 3.3 per cent more than in 2008.
In our country the company will enter 19.1 million euros, a 7.2% more than the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was worth $1 billion in Stock Exchange, and now its shares are worth $2,4 billion in total.
Since 2007 it has been listed in the New York Stock Exchange and is included in the Standard & Poor's benchmark.

Last October the Solera group bought Autoonline, an online platform for the sale of cars such as motorcycles or sinistered special vehicles.
The operation resulted in a disbursement of EUR 59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could be extended to the rest of the year by 15%.
The objective of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing a huge international market.
This service of valuation and purchase is directed exclusively to professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, reting companies, workshops, waste disposals and professional sellers who must be registered before undertaking operations.
This platform was established in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website currently has more than 1,500 registered vendors and 4,000 experts.
3,000 ads are managed daily and around 100 new ads are included in the Spanish market every day.
According to Spanish law, a car whose number of building blocks has been dropped cannot be recirculated, but it can be used as spare parts that are not damaged.
Cars with historical value can be discharged even if they have been given off after some gruesome managements.
Workshop budget in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the Audatex company ensures that the user gets a budget in just four steps: identify the vehicle, look for the replacement, create budget and generate budget.
The ease of use is an essential conditioner for these systems, especially to convince older professionals, who are more or less likely to be more reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, which are 666 tourists, 109 landers, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, to use it requires a computer with internet connection.
Once the model is identified to be repaired by its building number, a real graphical image of the model in question appears and then the necessary replacement is selected.
The user can include variables such as labor price, surcharges or discounts, and then print the budget to deliver to the customer.
AudaTaller is not a valuation tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalog.
The main difference between both systems is that workshop oriented does not include estimated working time.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is EUR 350 per year, which the customer can finance.
Currently the company Audatex is working to make these images three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics see with very good eyes, as it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn it around to see the inner face.
