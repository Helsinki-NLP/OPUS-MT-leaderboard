The members of the Wales Assembly are concerned - taking them for monks -
Dismay between some of the members of the Assembly, currently referred to as AM in English, by the suggestion that they should change their name by MWP (Member of the Wales Parliament).
The debate arose by plans to change the name of the assembly by the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly of the whole panorama fear to be object of ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party said that his group was concerned that the new name -rima with Twp and Pwp -
For those who don't know Welsh, \"twp\" means \"parvo\" and \"pwp\" means \"caca\"
One member of the party Plaid Cymru stated that the group's set - was not happy - and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh conservative said that his group kept an - mentally open - in regard to the change of name, but pointed out that from MWP to Muppet there is only one small verbal leap.
In this context, the letter -w - in Welsh is pronounced in a similar way to the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter -u -
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting the legislation to introduce the name changes, stated: -Of course, the final decision on any descriptor of the members of the Assembly will depend on the members themselves -
The Government of Wales Act 2017 granted the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation held on these proposals which showed much support for the name of Parliament of Wales.
With respect to the issue of AM title, the commission preferred members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but MWP's option received most support in a public consultation.
It appears that AMs are suggesting alternatives, but the struggle to achieve consensus could result in a headache for the president, Elin Jones, of whom the bill on changes is expected to be delivered in a few weeks.
The Reforms Act will include other changes in the functioning of the assembly, such as AM disablement rules and the design of the committee's system.
AMs will get the final vote on what should be called when they debate legislation.
Macedonians dock the polls in referendum to change the country's name
Electors will vote on Sunday if they change their country's name to -Republic of North Macedonia -
Popular vote will decide to resolve a dispute that already lasts decades with neighbouring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has been insisting for a long time that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim from its territory and repeatedly opposed its requests for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who in the plebiscite opposes the change of name, said he will ignore the vote.
However, referendum advocates, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, hold that the change of name is not at the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells keep silent as the Harlem churches continue to fight
\"The elders I spoke to said there was a bar and a church in every corner before,\" said Mr. Adams.
\"Today, neither one thing nor the other\"
He said he could understand the bars were gone.
\"Now people socialize in other ways,\" he said.
\"The bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhoods to which people usually go.\"
In regard to churches, he fears that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders expect, and -before or after will come back where they started -
He added that churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with communities of owners full of the type of people who would not help the neighborhoods remain shrines.
\"The vast majority of people who will buy the apartments of these buildings will be white\" \"declared, \"and will therefore speed up the closure of all these churches, because it is unlikely that the new owners will become members of those churches\"
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis, metropolitan community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved in the 1930s.
A nearby black congregation was done with the building.
St. Martin was occupied by a black congregation headed by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott at 125th Street stores, a Harlem commercial street that resisted hiring and ascending black people.
A fire produced in 1939 left the building badly damaged, but as Father Johnson's nuns made plans to rebuild it, they commissioned the carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin, proudly baptised the carillon as - the bells of the poor -
The expert who played the carillon in July called it otherwise, \"A cultural treasure - and - an insubstitutable historical instrument -
Expert Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan also pointed out that he was the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who changed him by the largest carillon of the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said no one took his place in St. Martin.
Those who have been occupying St. Martin for the past few months are a group of architects and contractors, some led by the lay leaders of the church and others by the Episcopal diocese.
The parish board, the organ that governs the parish and which is composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July showing its concern that the latter - intends to impact the costs - to the board, even though it did not participate in the recruitment of architects and contractors who sent the diocese.
Some nuns complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A shark hurts a boy while fishing lobsters in California
The police reported that a shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while practicing underwater fishing in the search for lobsters in California on the first day of that crustacean season.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach, in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends on Saturday morning when he listened to the boy asking for help screaming, when he was swimming with a group of people to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was just excitement to fish a lobster, but that he soon realized he was shouting--They talked to me!
They worked on me!'
He had the clavicle torn apart - Hammel said he realized when the boy arrived.
'There's a shark in the water!' added Hammel.
The boy was transferred in helicopter to the Rady Child Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical state.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, said in a press round that had divided a shark into the area a few weeks ago, but that they had determined that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic damage at the top of the torso.
Officers closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach, in Casablad, to Swami's, in Ecinitas, for 48 hours to undertake an investigation and also for security reasons.
Giles noted that more than 135 shark species exist in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the United Kingdom beauty market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty runners similar to those of large stores filled with specialist assistants.
As part of the considerable immersion in the UK beauty market, which amounts to Â£2,8 billion and continues to grow as fashion sales and home products fall, the largest beauty-produced runners will be tested at 11 stores across the country, and then they will pass on to others next year if they succeed.
The investment in beauty is produced at a time when supermarkets seek to fill up the shelves that in their day occupied televisions, microwaves and home products.
Sainsbury's stated that he would double his offer of beauty products until he achieved d 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Current collections of L'Oreal, Maybeline, and Burt's Bees will also get more space with exclusive zones similar to those you can see in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique make-up range so that most products are fit for vegans, something more and more demanded by the younger clientele.
In addition, the perfume shop, The Fragrance Shop, will prove concessions in two Saninsbury's establishments; the first opened in Croydon, in southern London last week, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, this year.
Online shopping and a change that translates into buying small amounts of food daily at small shops implies that supermarkets need to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, stated that establishments will increasingly resemble commercial centers, as supermarket chains try to compete with discount stores such as Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has already introduced Argos and Habitat sales points in hundreds of stores, as he bought the two chains two years ago.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to modernize its pharmacy and beauty departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's set in motion a joint initiative with Boots in the early 2000s, but association came to an end after a dispute about how to distribute the revenues of pharmacies in their supermarkets.
The new strategy arrives after Sainsbury's sold his pharmacy business consisting of 281 stores to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
Lloyds was commented to participate in the plan by adding a wide range of luxury cosmetic brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in 4 stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, stated: \"We transform the image of our beauty runners to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invest in specially trained staff who can go to for advice.
Our range of products is designed to fit all needs and attractive and practical locations mean that we are now a cosmetic destination that challenges old buying habits -
Peter Jones â furious â after Holly Willoughby withdraws from business of Â£11 million
The star of the Dragons Den program, Peter Jones, left - furious - after television presenter Holly Willoughby had withdrawn from a 11 million pound business with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for his brand of home clothes and Truly accessories.
His company had been compared to Goop, the brand of Gwyneth Ptrow.
The 37-year-old presenter of This Morning used Instagram to announce her farewell.
Holly Willoughby left the Dragons' Den star, Peter Jones throwing sparks when withdrawing from his lifestyle brand at the last minute to focus on his new gold contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources indicate that Jones was - Furious - when the golden girl on television admitted during a tense meeting held on Saturday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new business, valued at Â£1.5 million, meant that she had no time to dedicate to the brand of house clothes and accessories of both, Truly.
The business came to compare itself with Goop, the brand of Gwyneth Ptrow, and it was forecast to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at Â£11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby went to Instagram to announce that he was leaving Truly, Jones took a plane to Britain and headed for one of his vacation residences.
One source said, \"Truly was differently one of Holly's priorities.
It was to be their long-term future for the next two decades.
His decision to leave left amazed all the people who participated in the project.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There was a warehouse full of merchandise in Marlow's offices ready to sell-
Experts believe that the abandonment of This Morning's presenter is among Britain's most profitable stars could cost the company millions of pounds, due to considerable investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and textile for home, and that it could further delay its launch.
And it could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin are parents of three children and have a close friendship with Jones and his wife, Tara, for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52 years old, joined as president in March.
Couples were on vacation meetings and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television producer.
Willoughby will become the M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as a presenter in the ITV I'm programme to Celebrity.
A close source to Jones stated last night that \"We should not comment on his business matters\"
A complicated conversation - and then we fell in love -
He played with the criticisms he would receive on the part of the media for making a comment that some would consider - little of a president's own - and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give in so much?
Trump said by putting his voice on -television speaker -
\"I yielded nothing.\"
He noted that Kim is interested in maintaining a second meeting after his initial meeting held in June in Singapore, which Trump considers a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
But negotiations for denuclearization have stagnated.
More than three pesos after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's chief diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, communicated to world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday, that the North does not see the -corresponding response - by the U.S. to the first disarmament measures in North Korea.
Rather, it highlighted, the U.S. continues to impose sanctions directed to continue exerting pressure.
Trump adopted a much more optimistic view in his mitin speech.
âThings with North Korea go well,â he said.
We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have this excellent relationship -
He stated that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have had positive results: ending the tests with missiles, helping free the hostages and making the remaining U.S. soldiers return home.
And he defended his unusual strategy when talking about relations with Kim.
\"It's very easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out trying to get into this amphitheatre, we'd have about 200 people standing here,\" Trump said pointing out to the crowd that he had right in front of him.
A earthquake and tsunami ravage an island in Indonesia leaving hundreds of dead
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that they did not need them.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok was seen displaced, no national disaster was declared, which is an indispensable condition for catalyzing international aid.
\"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they are not going to apply for international help, so it is a challenge,\" said Mrs Sumbung.
While Save the Children is gathering a team to travel to Palu, it is still unclear whether foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster management agency, has ensured that Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies will be able to contribute to their assistance.
Given the earthquakes that Indonesia constantly supports, the country is extremely ill prepared to face the wrath of nature.
Although in Aceh shelters were built for tsunamis, it is not usual to find them on other shores.
Although an alert had been issued, the absence of a tsunami alert siren in Palu probably contributed to the loss of lives.
At best, traveling among many of the islands of Indonesia poses a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that had been featured in Lombok to cater to the earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to get the place of the new calamity.
President Joko Widodo's electoral campaign revolved around the improvement of the deteriorating infrastructures of Indonesia, and produced money on roads and railways.
But Mr. Joko's administration is affected by a great lack of funds in the final line at next year's re-election.
Mr. Joko is also affected by the continuing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a way of living the most conservative faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were forced to leave their homes because of the confrontation in the streets of Christian and Muslim bands, which use machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
View: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scores the tie goal in front of Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat in the Premier League before Chelsea with a goal on minute 89 on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri still being about 27 metres from Chelsea's port office with his team losing 1-0.
He touched the ball with his left leg before firing a shot at the second pole.
The balloon circled over the area as it advanced toward the top left corner of the network.
The ball ended up falling over a Kepa Arrizabalaga that jumped into the air and entering the net.
\"Just trying to get to that position, to organize us, and players like Shaq always play the ball forward as much as possible, so I tried to earn as much time as possible\" said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
\"I'm coming to Kante and they say a touch without thinking too much and just disappear.\"
Chelsea won 1-0 at rest after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in minute 25.
The Azuis front passed the heel ball to Mateo Kovacic in that play, before turning near the half change and going in running into the Liverpool field.
Kovacic made a wall in the center of the field.
He made a beautiful walk in depth driving Hazard towards the area.
Hazard overcame the defense and ended up on the second pole marking with a shot with the zord that Alisson Becker was unable to stop.
Liverpool faces Naples at the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at St. Paul's Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will do the same with Videoton in the UEFA Europe League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The number of fatal victims of the Indonesian tsunami was elected to 832
The number of deaths in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, as reported on Sunday morning by the national disaster management agency.
Many people would be trapped between the rubble of the buildings that came down with the magnitude 7.5 earthquake on Friday and which provoked waves of up to 6 meters, as indicated in a press round the spokesman of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is covered with rubble coming from the fallen buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman had been stabbed to death
A murder investigation was opened after this morning finding a woman's body in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with white gun wounds on John Street, and arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of murder.
The police asked the people in the area to see or hear something from that one step forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan stated: 'The investigation is at its initial stage, but I would like to make a call so that he will contact us anyone who has been in the vicinity of John Street at Birkenhead who sees or hears anything suspicious.
I would also like to ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, to capture anything with the control panel camera that gets in touch with us, as they might have key information for our investigation'.
A police spokesman confirmed that the body found belongs to a neighbour of Birkenhead and that he was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believed to meet the woman came to the scene to answer questions about where she was found that morning.
The investigation continues as the police claim to be in the process of informing the nearest family members of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police have informed him that they do not allow anyone to enter or leave the building.
The man ran out of words when he found out what happened.
Residents have just known that they will not be able to reenter until within a few hours.
A police officer has been heard to tell a man that the area is considered a crime scene.
A woman crying appears on the scene.
It doesn't stop saying 'it's awful'.
At 2 p.m. there were two police vans inside the cord with another van just outside.
Several officers remain inside the cordon watching the apartment block.
Anyone who has information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, to call 101 or to contact Crimestoppers anonymously in the phone number 0800 555 111 citing registration 247 of September 30.
Cromwell's statue of parliament becomes the last monument affected by the struggle to \"rewrite history\"
His prohibition would be poetic justice for his Taliban destruction of so many religious and cultural objects of England carried out by his fanatical and puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society qualified Mr. Crick's suggestion of -disparate - and of - trying to rewrite the story -
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, stated: \"It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's figure located outside Westminster Palace became a target.
The iconoclasty of English civil wars was not ordered or performed by Cromwell.
Perhaps they would have sacrificed the Cromwell wrong for his ancestor Thomas' actions in the previous century.
Cromwell's magnificent representation performed by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a proof of the opinion existing in the 19th century, and part of the historiography of a figure that many consider to remain worthy of homage.
Mr. Goldsmith stated to The Sunday Telegraph: -Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more by the end of the 19th century that now, as a defender of parliament in the face of external pressure, in this case, of course, it was the monarchy.
Whether or not that is a fully complete representation is the object of a continuous historical debate.
What is clear is that the conflict of the mid 17th century defined the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure representing one side of the divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also deserving of celebration and commemoration â
A murderous pig crushes a Chinese farmer
According to local media, a pig attacked and murdered a farmer in a market in southwestern China.
Last Sunday the South China Morning Post reported that the man, identified solely by the surname, \"Yuan,\" was found dead with a sectioned and blood-covered artery near a cortello in the Liupanshui market, in the province of Guizhou.
A pig poacher prepares to put the vaccines to pigs in a bark on 30 and May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai province, China.
Apparently she had traveled with her cousin on Wednesday from Yunnan's neighbouring province to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door that gave to another adjacent court.
He said at the court there was a big male with blood in his mouth.
Forensic analysis confirmed that the pig, nearly 250 kilos, attacked the farmer until he killed him.
\"My cousin had bloodied and broken legs,\" said the primer, nicknamed \"Wu\" to the Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera recording shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to give him food for his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been shut down to prevent him from attacking anyone else, as the police gathered evidence on the stage.
It seems that Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating a compensation for his death.
Although they are not very common, cases of pigs that attack humans previously have already been recorded.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on the farm that the couple had in Massachusetts, producing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a pig of nearly 300 kilos huddled a Welsh farmer against the tractor until his wife arrived and frightened the animal.
After an Oregon farmer had been devoured by his own pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as -disparator.
- They're just playing.
They're like children, very curious... they don't intend to hurt.
You just have to have the necessary respect for them - he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring strong and generalized rains to the southwestern U.S.
Forecasts indicate that Hurricane Rosa weakens as it overruns cold waters on the north coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will carry torrential rains north of Mexico and south-west of the U.S. during the next few days.
At 5 a.m. on Sunday, Eastern hour, Rosa was a category 1 hurricane with winds of over 135 km/h and was located about 620 kilometers from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a wave begins to take shape over the Pacific Ocean and move eastward, heading towards the U.S. East Coast.As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, she will begin pushing tropical humidity northward, which will penetrate the southwestern U.S.
Rosa will bring over 250 l/m2 rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Next, the interaction of tropical humidity with the fence will create abundant and generalized rains in the southwest in the next few days.
At the local level, precipitation of between 25 and 100 l/m2 will cause dangerous sudden flooding, debris flows, and the possibility of land spills in the desert.
Great tropical humidity will cause precipitation that will reach 50 or 75 l/m2 in point zones, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In parts of the southwest it is expected from 50 to 100 l/m2 of rain, especially over much of Arizona.
Possibility of sudden flooding with deteriorating conditions due to the dispersed character of tropical rain.
We strongly discourage adventure in the desert under threat of tropical rain.
Strong rains could form cannons that could become floating rivers, and electric storms will bring locally cracked winds and dust.
The walnut will bring locally strong rains to parts of the southern California coast.
Total rainfall could reach more than 12 l/m2, which in turn could cause the flow of minor rubble and slippery roads.
These would be the first rains of the wet station in the region.
Disperse tropical rains will begin approaching Arizona at the last hours of Sunday and early Monday, before the rain extends at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
Abundant rain will reach Four Corners on Tuesday, which will last until Wednesday.
October will witness large temperature oscillations in the U.S. due to Arctic cooling, although tropics will remain quite warm.
On occasion this involves important temperature changes in short distances.
On Sunday we will be able to see a great example of drastic temperature differences in the middle of the U.S.
There will be a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
During the next few days, the persistent summer heat will try to reappear and expand again.
For the central and eastern part of the country a warm start of October is expected, with temperatures that will exceed 26 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
New York could reach the 26 degrees on Tuesday, which constitute about 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates high probability of temperatures higher than the average for the east of the country during the first half of October.
Over 20 million people saw the trial at Brett Kavanaugh
Over 20 million people followed in six television channels the passionate witnesses of the judge appointed to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, political stagnation continues and chains interrupt their usual programming for a new final hour of Friday: an agreement designed by Senator Arizona, Jeff Flake, to have the FBI conduct a week's investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate's Judicial Committee that it's a hundred percent certain that Kavanaugh made him play them being drunk and that he tried to get his clothes off at a high school party.
In a passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said that he was totally certain that this had not happened.
Nielsen reported on Friday that more than 20.4 million people would have seen him.
The company counted the average audience at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other strings that broadcast it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has trouble measuring people watching television from offices.
To get an idea, it is a similar audience to that of a football end or the Oscar ceremony.
Fox News Channel, which largely supported Kavanaugh's appointment, led all chains with an average of 5.69 million spectators during a trial that lasted all day, according to Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94, MSNBC 2.89, and CNN 2.52 million according to Nielsen.
After the trial the interest persisted.
Flake was the central figure of Friday on television.
After the moderate Republican office made a statement indicating that it would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, it was captured by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning being beaten by demonstrators when attempting to enter an elevator on its way to the hearing of the Judicial Committee.
It remained with a low look for several minutes while being repressed, live TV on CNN.
\"I'm here in front of you,\" said one woman.
Do you think he's telling the country the truth?
He was told, \"You have power while there are many defenseless women.\"
Flake said his office made a Flake statement, before the elevator had been closed, added that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
All television and cable chains were broadcast live hours later when the Judicial Committee had to vote to advance Kavanaugh's appointment before the full Senate to submit to the vote.
But Flake said he would only do that if the FBI investigated the allegations against the nominee the next week, something that urged a minority of Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by the conversations held with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with Coons and with several senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's choice had power, because it was evident that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened an inquiry into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accuses critics of \"playing politics\" with Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May accused anyone of criticizing his plans to leave the European Union to - play politics - with Britain's future and to prejudice national interest.
Prime Minister Theresa May arriving at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview next to his on the cover of the paper, his former Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson, insisted on attacking the so-called May Chequers plan for Brexit saying that the proposal that Britain and the EU should raise the tariffs on the other side was - totally absurd -

Its average past season was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, the LSU basketball coach, Will Wade, stated that the team was -- down -- and -- moved by Wayde's passing.
\"This is what concerns us all the time,\" Wade said.
Volcano casts ash on Mexico City
The ashes that cast the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention advised Mexicans on Saturday to move away from the volcano after activity was detected in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were registered within 24 hours.
The center was overseeing several stanzas and tremors.
The images of social media showed thin layers of ash in the parabris of Mexico City neighborhoods such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists detected an increase in the activity of the volcano located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake shook the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as -Don Goyo - has been active since 1994.
Facing between the police and the Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters faced the riot police and while thousands of people joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizing vote on the secession of Catalonia.
A group of masked proseparatists contained by the anti-disturbing police guindolles eggs and dust painting that created dark dust clouds in the streets that are usually crowded with tourists.
There were also subsequent refreshments that same day with the police, who used the sluts to contain the liorta.
For several hours, pro-independent groups that were coreaÂ­ding - not forgetting or forgiving - faced unionist protesters who shouted -Long life in Spain -
Fourteen people had to be treated for mild wounds received in the protest, according to the local press.
Tension continues the skin flower in the independentist region a year after the October 1 referendum held by the Catalan separatists, although considered illegal by Madrid.
Voters opted out of independence, though participation was low and opponents of secession boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the vote at the polling stations throughout the region in violent confrontations.
Proindependant groups camped all night on Friday to avoid a demonstration of support for the national police.
The demonstration occurred equally but were seen in the obligation to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who came to the independentist demonstration with his wife, said he had no hope for the possibility that Catalonia would achieve independence anymore.
Last year we lived one of our best moments.
I've seen my parents cry with joy at being able to vote, but now we're all fucked up - he said.

Menga's goal gives Livingston 1-0 victory over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ended in victory
Ascending Livingston surprised the Rangers by leading Steven Gerrard to his second defeat in 18 matches as a coach at the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal was decisive for Gary Holt's team to rise a level by placing after the Hibernian, in second position.
Gerrard's team is still uncanny out of the house this year at Premiership and next Sunday they face the leader, the Hearts, from which they are separated by eight points.
But first the Rangers will receive Rapid Vienna in Europe League Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues to invest in division by sixth consecutive party; the principal coach, Holt, has not yet met defeat since he replaced Kenny Miler the past me.
Livingston lets opportunities escape from weakened visitors
Holt's team must have advanced much before the time they scored, as with their control they caused all kinds of problems to Rangers.
Scott Robinson opened his way but his crossfire did not cross the threshold of the gate; next, Alan Lithgow's shot came out driven by a head of Craig Halkett from the other side of the gate.
The host team was made up of letting the Rangers play in front of them, aware that they could put visitors at risk in the parades.
And that's how the decisive goal came.
The Rangers awarded a free shot and Livingston held a sack in which Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined their efforts to fix Menga, which touched the ball and scored from the center of the area.
At that time the Rangers dominated possession but found himself with an impenetrable defense that prevented much work from the guard Liam Kelly.
That pattern continued in the second half, though Alfredo Morelos forced a Kelly stop.
The Rangers' Warehouse, Allan McGregor detained with his weight a shot by Scott Pittman, and Lithgow sent the ball out on another shot at Livingston's stationary ball.
Many cross-passes were prodiged in the Livingston area which were continuously cleared, while two penalty requests were rejected: one by hand and one by a Halkett entry to the Glenn Middleton substitute.
'Fenomenal - by Livingston: analysis
Alasdair Lamont for BBC Scotland from Tony Macaroni Stadium
A phenomenal performance and outcome for Livingston.
'E unanimously, they were excellent and continue to overcome expectations in their upward trajectory.
His style of play and players have hardly changed since he returned to the top category, but part of the merit is Holt's in the way he has pushed the team since his arrival.
I had a lot of heroes.
Halkett, the Captain, has superbly conducted a perfectly organized defense while Menga has not given Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall a breath throughout the game.
The Rangers lacked inspiration.
Despite working well on occasions under Gerrard's orders, on this occasion they did not attain that level.
They failed the last pass, they only managed to penetrate the host team once, a whole call for the Rangers, which is found in half the table.
Erdogan receives an ambiguous reception in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, there were blue smiles and skies during the meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany for lunch in Berlin.
It is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany, who intends to arrange the relationship between NATO allies.

The police claimed security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from meeting in front of the mosque, but many Erdogan supporters approached to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan (many of them Kurds) also raised their voices condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to receive it in the country.
The protest duel reflects the division before a visitor acclaimed as a hero by some German Turks and criticized as autocrat by others.

Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (the places affected by drought could benefit)
It is rare for a tropical depression to affect Arizona, but it is very likely to occur early next week, when the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa runs through the South West Desert leaving the possibility of sudden flooding.
The National Meteorology Service has already issued warnings of sudden flooding for Monday and Tuesdays of Western Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, the southeast of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to pass directly over Phoenix on Tuesday and arrive at the last hour of Monday with rain.
The Phoenix National Meteorology Service indicated on a Twitter publication that only - ten tropical cyclones had maintained the state of depression or tropical storm on a 320-kilometre radio in Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that extended on a 64-kilometre radius of the Arizona border -
The latest models of the National Meteorology Service provide for 50 to 10 l/m2 of rain, with isolated quantities of up to 150l/m2 in the Arizona MogollÃ³n Edge.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert, such as the Central Rockies and the Great Conca could reach up to 25 or 50 liters, with possible totals isolated of 100 l/m2.
For those who are out of danger from sudden flooding, the rain of Rosa could be a blessing, as the region is greatly affected by the droughts.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some of this rain can be beneficial, as the Southwest is experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Dry Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme dryness, the second largest category - reportedweather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will touch land on the California Low Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, who will still have hurricane strength on Sunday morning, with wind of a maximum of 136 km/h, is 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and head north at 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm is finding cold water in the Pacific and therefore losing strength.
For this reason it is hoped that it will touch land in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or on Monday night.
It could rain with a lot of intensity in some areas of Mexico, assuming a major flood risk.
The total rainfall of between 75 and 150 l/m2 is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, and can be found up to 250 l/m2 - reportsweather.com.
Next, Rosa will head north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border at the first hour of Tuesday as a tropical depression and then continue to climb across Arizona and enter southern Utah the last hour of Tuesday night.
The main danger of Rosa or what remains of it is the strong precipitation in Baja California, northwest of Sonora and in the U.S. Southwest Desert - reported the National Center of Hurricanes.
It is hoped that these rains can cause sudden water trumpets and debris flows in the deserts, and land detachments in mountainous lands.

Trump states that Kavanaugh âsuffered the Mesquinity and cholera' of the Democratic Party
-To vote for Judge Kavanaugh is to vote to reject the ruthless and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party - Trump said in a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump stated that Kavanaugh-supplied the Mesquinity and Cholera- of the Democratic Party throughout its appointment process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, where he categorically and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that she had sexually assaulted her decades ago, being teenagers.
Ford also testified at the trial on his charge.

The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia causes hundreds of deaths and the number continues to grow
Authorities reported on Saturday that at least 384 people died, many of them dragged by giant waves that broke up on the beaches, when a large earthquake and tsunami affected the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday to attend a festival on the beach of the town of Palu when waves of up to six meters broke down on the ground to the lustrafusco, taking the lives of many and destroying everything in its passage.
The tsunami followed a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
- Yesterday, when the threat arose, people were still with their activities on the beach and did not flee immediately, so they were killed - Sutopo Purwo Nugroho declared, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency BNPB in a round of prey in Iacarta.
The tsunami did not come alone, dragged automobiles, trunks, house, swept everything he found - Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled high seas at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
Some people went up to the trees to escape the tsunami and managed to survive, he said.
Some 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The aerial photographs disseminated by the national disaster management agency showed many shops and destroyed buildings, twisted and knocked down bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The replicas continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes felt in an area with 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) stated that the energy released by the huge Friday earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb launched on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, sitting at the end of a long narrow bay, was able to magnify the size of the tsunami, he stated.
Nugroho described the damage as \"quantious\" and said thousands of homes, hospitals malls and hotels had come down.
The bodies of some victims found themselves trapped under the rubble of the collapsed buildings, stated, adding that 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho announced that the victims and damage could be greater along the northern coast of Palu, an area called Donggala and that it is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications were - completely paralyzed and there is no information - from Donggala, Nugroho added.
There are more than 300,000 people living there - it informed the Red Cross in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
\"This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse,\" he declared.
The agency was harshly criticized on Saturday for not having reported the arrival of a tsunami to Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived at the time the warning was issued.
In a recording of the amateur shared on social media, one can hear a man who is found on the last floor of a building screaming frantically warning of the arrival of a tsunami to the people who were on the street.
In a matter of minutes the water clashs against kissing leading ahead buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately certify the authenticity of the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami caused an important blackout that provoked the cutting of communications throughout Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue tasks.
The authorities state that the army has already begun sending cargo aircraft from Iacarta and other cities, but the evacuated continue to urgently need food and other basic needs.
The city airport has reopened but only for relief tasks and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo plans to visit the Palu evacuation centers on Sunday.
The tsunami victims balance in Indonesia exceeds the figure of 800.
It's terrible.
On the way he walked World Vision staff to get to the city of Palu, where employees were rescued in canvas shelters raised in the courtyard of his office, contemplated scenes of total devastation, commented Mr. Dosaba.
\"They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,\" he said.
It's terrible.
Even when groups began the unpleasant task of ongoing assistance in case of catastrophe, some complained that they were preventing Palu from travelling to foreign humanitarian workers with great knowledge and experience.
According to Indonesian legislation, funds, supplies and staffing from overseas may flow only if the place of calamity is declared a national catastrophic zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
\"It's still a disaster at the level of a province,\" said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
\"As soon as the government says \"Okay, this is a national disaster, we will be able to open up to international aid, but that time has not yet arrived\"
As the second night fell in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, relatives and friends of the disappeared held on to the hope that their loved ones would be one of the miracles that relieves the depressing argument of natural disasters -
On Saturday they took a child out of a sink.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been under the rubble for two days with her mother's body beside her.
Gendon Subandono, trainer of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing parapentists for Asian Games, who completed at the beginning of this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagi added that some of the people trapped in the Roa Roa hotel were his pupils.
\"As a person with extensive experience in the paragliding field, I have my own emotional burden,\" he said.
Gendon told how, in the hours following the spread of the news of the break-up of the Roa Roa hotel among the parapentist community, he had desperately tried to send messages from WhatsApp to the competitors in Palu, who were participating in the beach festival
However, in the messages only a gray mark was shown instead of two blue marks.
-I think that means the messages were not delivered - he added.

Rapeiro Kanye West changes the name for Ye
Raper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
To announce the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote, \"The being formerly known as Kanye West\"
It has been some time since West, 41, is known with the nickname Ye, which he used as the title of his eighth album, published in June.
The change occurred before its appearance on Saturday Night Live, where it is expected to launch its new Yandhi album.
It will replace the singer Ariana Grande in the program, who cancelled her attendance for -emotional motivations - according to the program's creator.
In addition to being an abbreviation for his current professional name, West had already previously explained that the word had a religious meaning for him.
-I think âye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it stands for -ti -', I had stated that same year West as I was talking about his record to the Big Boy radio presenter.
- So I'm you, it's us, it's us.
I went from Kanye, which means the only, only Ye, which is a reflection of the goodness in us, of wickedness, of confusion, of everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are â
Kanye is another of the famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was previously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, although this year he announced he preferred to be called Love and Brother Love.
An old contributor from West, JAY-Z, also leaned by putting and removing the script and using the capitals.
AMLO commits not to use military against civilians
Mexico's elected president, AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador, undertook not to use the military force against civilians again when the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against the students is approaching.
LÃ³pez Obrador promised on Saturday at the Tlatelolco square that -he would no longer use the military to repress the Mexican people -
On October 2, 1968, troops fired on a peaceful demonstration at the square killing about 300 people at a time when student movements were taking root throughout Latin America.
LÃ³pez Obrador promised to support Mexican youth by giving monthly help to boys studying and opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities drags boys into criminal gangs.
US should double the investment in I.A.
According to the AI professional Kai-Fu Lee, former employee of Google, Microsoft, and Apple, U.S. should double the amount it invests in AI in view of China's growing activity in the field.
Comments were produced after several parts of the U.S. government had made announcements about AI, even if the U.S. lacks a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan the previous year: it aims to be number 1 in innovation in AI by 2030.
-Duplicating the budget in research in AI would be a good start, since the other countries are far behind the U.S., and we are looking for the next great breakthrough in AI - Lee said.
Duplicate funding could double the chances that the next AI achievement would be made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is general director of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most prominent Chinese AI companies: Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that won the American Othello player with higher score and subsequently was executive in Microsoft Research from the Google subsidiary in China.
Lee recognized former U.S. government technology contests such as the Robotic Challenge of the Defence Advanced Research Project Agency and asked when it would be next to help identify the upcoming visionaries.
In the U.S., researchers often have to work hard to obtain government scholarships, says Lee.
\"China is not who is leading academic leaders, but companies,\" he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have hired university geniuses to work in AI.
Lee pointed out that changing immigration policy could also help the U.S. to boost its efforts in AI.
\"I think they should offer doctors residence cards in AI,\" he said.
The China Council of State published its New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences in China offers funding to people from academic institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to researchers in the U.S., but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established an artificial intelligence center that is meant to include industry and university partners, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Information.
And this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As for NSF, you currently invest over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation seeking to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not recorded movement for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum if they change the country's name.
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday in a referendum if they wished to change their name to (Republic of North Macedonia) a movement that would resolve a dispute for decades with Greece and that had blocked applications for admission in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbours represents a claim from its territory and vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The governments of the two countries reached an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but the nationalist opponents claim that the change would prejudice the ethnic identity of the majority of the Slavic population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he will not vote on the referendum and a boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether the outcome will reach 50 percent minimum necessary for the referendum to be valid.
The question contained in the referendum paper was, \"It is in favor of NATO and the EU accession with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece.\"
Name change advocates, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is a price worth paying to obtain admission in entities such as the EU or NATO of Macedonia, one of the emerging countries of the fall of Yugoslavia.
\"Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us,\" said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, quite a few members of parliament have said that they would abide by the result of the vote and that they would do so definitively.
The change of nine would require a two-thirds majority of parliament.
The state election commission claimed that at 1 p.m. no irregularity had been recorded.
However, participation was only about 16 percent, compared to 34 percent of the last 2016 parliamentary elections, when 66 percent of registered voters deposited their vote.
\"I came to vote for my children, our site is in Europe,\" said Gjoose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter of the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko deposited their vote for the Macedonian referendum on the change of name of the country that would pave the way for their accession to the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
Before the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of the tents mounted for whom the referendum had been boycotted.
We are in favour of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to do so with our heads high and not the service door, Kavadarkov added.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If we are not accepted as Macedonia, we can go to other countries like China and Russia and enter into the Eurasian Union â
Prime Minister Zaev states that NATO membership will bring the much needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
-I think the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of entry into the EU and NATO - Zaev commented after depositing his vote.
He said a positive result would be the â confirmation of our future â
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research revealed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, figure that is below the requirement.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian TV chain Telma indicated that 57 percent of the people consulted planned to go vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said he would vote yes.
For the referendum to be valid the result has to be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure in the referendum would represent the first major blow to pro-Western government policy since it had access to power in May of a in the past.
View: Sergio AgÃ¼ero, Manchester City player, runs across Brighton's entire defense and ends up scoring a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling reported Brighton's defense with the 2-0 Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously simple to mark the goal of minute 65.
The Argentine front received a pass in the middle field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between three Brighton defenses before addressing the open field.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four green T-shirts.
A defense was laid out before overcoming several more on the edge of the Brighton area.
Next, he passed the ball to his left and found Sterling.
The English foreman used the first picket area to return the ball to Aguero, which hit the Brighton Mathew Ryan's wardrobe with a shot to the right of the network.
âAguero is going through some problems on the foot â the City coach, Pep Guardiola, said to the reporters.
We're talking about him playing 55 or 60 minutes.
And that's when it happened.
We were lucky that you'd scored at that time.
But it was Sterling who gave the blues the initial advantage in the Premier League's confrontation.
That goal came in minute 29.
Aguero received the balloon in the depth of Brighton's field in that play.
He sent a beautiful pass to the gap on the right side towards Leroy Sane.
Sane gave several touches before driving Sterling towards the opposite pole.
The tiles put the ball in the gate before leaving the field.
The City faces Hoffenheim in the Champions League group on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to water the party to the Rockies
With the Nationals out of the struggle for elimination, there were not many reasons to force another tenure.
But a constantly competitive Scherzer hopes to launch Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still implications in the elimination for the Rockies, which lead an advantage party to Los Angeles Dodgers in the western division of the national league.
The Rockies secured at least one wildcard position with the 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but they kept trying to close their first division title.
\"Although we haven't played anything, at least we can play the gum knowing that the atmosphere in Denver with the crowd and with the other team would be likely to play at the highest level I played this year.
Why don't I want to compete with that--
The Nationals have not yet announced who will be the openman on Sunday, but apparently insist that Scherzer be what he throws in a situation like that.
Scherzer, for whom would be his number 34, made another bullpen session on Thursday and will probably launch Sunday on his usual day of rest.
Washington's right hand is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strokes at 220 2/3 entries this season.
Trump celebrates a rally in West Virginia
The president referred indirectly to the situation surrounding the elected to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, as he speaks of the importance of the outcome in the half-mandate elections.
We played everything we did in November.
Five weeks are missing for one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is something big, big... I don't have to, but I really do, and that's why I'm going everywhere fighting for big candidates - he said.
Trump went on to say, \"You see this horrible radical group of Democrats, look what's happening now.
And they are determined to regain power using any necessary means, wickedness, and pettyness.
They don't care who they hurt, above who they have to go through to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control and we'll never give it to them --
The mission of the Democrats is to oppose and hinder -
\"And you've seen that for the past four days,\" he said, \"qualifying the Democrats of--annoyed, waltzed, disgusting, and liars.\"
He listed the Senate Judicial Committee citing Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, who received strong public applause.
Do you remember your answer?
Have you filtered the document?
Mmm..ejem, what?
No, mmm, no, wait, it was the worst body language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party is no longer so open.
He is not tolerant to those who express his opinion
When Momentum activists from my local party voted to censure me, the truth is I wasn't surprised.
after all, I am the last of a number of Labour Members who are not well received, and all for saying our opinion.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan was treated in a similar way because she was resolutely confronted with anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn
on the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security and on Europe, casually topics on which Jeremy was dissenting with previous leaders.
The notification for the Labour Meeting of Nottingham East on Friday indicated that -we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive -
For the most part of the eight years I have been a Labour Member, the committee's Friday night meetings have been exactly that way.
Unfortunately, that is no longer the tone of many meetings, and the promise of a policy - kinder and gentler - has long been forgotten, if ever it has begun.
It is increasingly evident that the Labour Party does not tolerate different opinions and is judged if all opinions are acceptable to the party leader.
This began shortly after Jeremy became party leader, when colleagues with whom he believed to share a similar political view began to expect me to portray and adopt stances with which he would never agree, whether in national security matters as in the EU's single market.
When I speak publicly, and actually a little bit alike what I say, there's a tremendous noise and attacks on social media censoring center politics, telling me that I shouldn't be in the Labor Party.
And it doesn't just happen to me.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since comments that are addressed to me are usually of a political nature.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a stream of sexist or racist comments every day and who do not give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how insult levels have been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn stated last week that the Labour Party had to foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer so open and that with every movement of -not trusting - or every change in the rules of selection, the party becomes narrower in glances.
During the past few years I have received many advices that urge me to keep my head hidden, not to be so frank and that then - everything would be fine for me -
But I didn't get into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party there are 32 still in school, led by the negligence of Thatcher's government that had literally dropped my classroom, I have tried to claim better public services for those who need them most, both being local conceler and government minister.
I've never hidden my politics, not even my last choice.
No member of Nottingham East could be confused with my political stances and I disagree with the party's current leadership.
To those who promoted the Friday motion, the only thing I would say is that as the country walks towards a Brexit that will affect our homes, businesses and public services, I don't understand that desire to waste time and energy questioning my loyalty to the party leader.
But, in fact, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents, whether they are members or not of the party: I am proud to serve them and I promise that no threat or political convenience will deter me from acting according to what I consider the best interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: an Ayr invict puts itself in the head
It is possible that the last two attempts had somewhat altered the final outcome, but it is no doubt that the Ayr deserved to win this fine party of the Premier League of Lieutenant.
Now they lead the table and it's the only invicted team of the ten.
Finally it was the superiority of his defense, as well as the fact that he risked, the team led him to victory, and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
\"So far we've put the test on our parties and we're still invincible, so I have to be happy,\" he said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, said, \"You have to admit that Ayr has taken advantage of the opportunities better than we do.
Grant Anderson's minute 14 essay, transformed by Frazier Climo, put forward the Ayr, but a yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, handed over to the party by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to make the numbers speak and Jason Baggot failed to launch.
Climate increased the advantage for the Ayr with a penalty, before, just in the middle of time, it turned a single shot, leaving the 17-5 marker in favor of the Ayr at rest.
But Melrose began well the second half and Patrick Anderson's essay, transformed by Baggot, reduced the advantage to five points.
Next there was a prolonged stop for the severe injury that Ruaridh Knott suffered, which abandoned the camp into panyola and, since the reboot, Ayr advanced further through an essay by Stafford McDowall, transformed by Climo.
The captain in functions dde Ayr, Blair Macpherson, received a yellow card and Melrose took part in having one more player with an essay by Bruce Colvine that was not consumed, at the end of a period of much pressure.
However, the local team returned and when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow card for score to Climo when he did not have the ball, McPjherson scored an essay from the penalty line at the back of Ayr's maul.
Clicko marked, as he did almost from the reboot, after Kyle Rowe had picked up the pitch in the David Armstrong area and had sent it to the third line Gregor Henry to get the fifth essay of the local team.

'The sea is ours': the inner Bolivia expects the court to go the way to the Pacific
The sailors watched a naval headquarters covered with appliances in La Paz.
Public buildings wave a blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are nestled from the slogan:-The sea is ours by right.
Recovering it is a duty -
In the sealess Bolivia, the memory of a lost coast in front of Chile in a bloody 19th century resource conflict remains alive, just as the desire to sail back across the Pacific Ocean.
Perhaps those hopes are at their peak in decades, as Bolivia expects a decision from the international court of justice on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
\"Bolivia has the necessary impulse, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, awaits a positive outcome - expressed Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the ruling of the CIX on giant screens throughout the country in the hope that the Hague Court will pronounce itself in favour of Bolivia's claim and that, after decades of intermittent conversations, Chile will be forced to negotiate the granting of Bolivia from a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has much at stake in Monday's sentence.
\"We're very close to going back to the Pacific Ocean,\" he promised in late August.
But some analysts consider it unlikely that the court would give Bolivia reason, and that little would change if that happened.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands has no power to adjudicate Chilean territory, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible conversations.
The fact that the CIX sentence comes only six months after the final arguments we hear indicates that the case - has not been complicated - states the Chilean expert in international law Peace ZÃ¡rate.
And far from promoting Bolivia's cause, the last four years could have delayed it.
The topic of access to the sea has long been blocked by the current Bolivian administration - manifests ZÃ¡rate.
Morales' belligerent rhetoric undermined his willingness to stay in Chile, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume conversations at some point, but it will be very difficult to keep them after this.
The two countries have been without exchange ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo RodrÃ­guez VeltzÃ©, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court had been to make an unusually quick decision.
On Monday Bolivia will have a fantastic opportunity to open a new stage of relations with Chile - and an opportunity to -put an end to 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefits.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using this topic for political purposes.
-Bolivia will never give up her right to have access to the Pacific ocean - she added.
-The sentence is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past -
North Korea says that nuclear disarmament will not occur unless it can rely on US.
North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Yong states that his nation will not proceed to nuclear disarmament if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He made a call to the United States to fulfill the promises made during a summit in Singapore among his leaders.
This comment is produced at a time when U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompey, seems to be about to restart stagnant nuclear diplomacy for more than three decades after the summit with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong One.
Ri states that it is - a utopia - that America's continued sanctions and objections to a declaration that will put an end to the Korean War succeed in doubling to the North.
In Washington he refuses to accept the statement without Pyongyang giving the first step towards disarmament.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump wish for a second summit.
But there is generalized skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about renouncing an arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its safety.
Pompey plans to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows reveal the last line of giant hats that will soon be in the shops.
If you wish to increase your hat collection or just cover yourself completely from the sun, don't look any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed on the gateway a series of extravagant accessories for their spring-summer 2019 collection that embraced the public with the purest style of Paris Fashion Week.
The impossible hats filled Instagram this summer and these designers pulled out the gateway their most amazing creations.
Valentino's main piece was an exaggerated beam hat adorned with a wide tab mimicking feathers that flooded the heads of the models.
Among other large accessories there were dripping sandals, a wizard hat and even a pineapple, but were not designed to protect the head from the cold.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of strange masks... just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had the lips sewn and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than the high seam.
One of the creations looked like a complete dive team, with the glasses and the tube, and another a melting ice cream cone.
And if you're a fan of the huge fashion, you're lucky.
The fashionable ones predicted that giant caps could reach the shops.
Disproportioned hats come just after the \"Bomba - the straw hat with a 60-centimeter tab that takes everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult mark that is behind the hat impossible that invades all social media has brought out the gateway another great creation: a straw beach bag almost as large as the model tied with a bathing suit that carries it.
The orange raffia bag adorned with raffia flakes and finished with a white leather handle, was the outstanding piece of the 2019 spring collection of Jacquemus' La Riviera on the Paris Fashion Week.
The famous designer Luke Armitage stated the FEMAIL: 'I hope hats and large beach bags get to the shops next summer, as the designer had such a big impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversize accessories'.
John Edward: Linguistic skills are essential for citizens of the world
Scotland's private schools maintain a history of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another harvest of outstanding results in exams, which is only reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music, and other community subjects.
With over 30,000 students all over Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS for their English acronyms), strive to offer the best level to students and their parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for higher education, for the career they choose, and their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailor-made study plan, we are seeing modern languages continue to be a popular and desired topic within schools.
Nelson Mandela said, \"If you speak to a man in a language he understands, that comes to his head.
But if you speak to him in his own language, he will reach his heart--
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to establish relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's recent exams, we can see that languages are at the top of the board and with the highest approval rates in private schools.
About 68% of students who studied foreign languages gained an outstanding level.
The data, compiled from the 74 schools that make up the SCIS, show that 72% of students obtained registration of honor in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish, also achieved an outstanding one.
This demonstrates that Scottish private schools support languages and consider them key skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, languages are having the same consideration as subjects such as science, technology, engineering, and mathematics in private and all-like school programs.
A survey conducted by the Commission for Employment and Training of the United Kingdom in 2014 indicated that among the lack of language knowledge it constitutes 17% of the reasons why employers are costing them the vacancies.
Therefore, linguistic skills are increasingly essential to preparing the youth for their future careers.
These skills are essential in a globalized world, as more labor possibilities exist that require languages.
Regardless of the chosen career, if they learn a second language they will have a real advantage in the future with a life skills like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will place a bilingual person directly at the head of the competition.
According to a survey of YouGov among more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75% did not speak any foreign language well enough to maintain a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a percentage of two digits, in this case about 15%.
That's why it's so important to invest in a language for children today.
Knowing multiple languages, especially those of developing economies, provides children with more opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, teaching languages differ according to school.
Some schools focus on the most classic modern languages, while others are decanted by languages considered most important to the United Kingdom by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of what their children's interests are, private schools always have multiple languages to choose from and specialist teachers in this field.
Scottish private schools specialize in providing a learning environment that prepares children and teams with the necessary skills to succeed, whatever the future holds for them.
We cannot deny that at this time, in a global business environment, languages remain of vital importance to the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered â international communication skills â
Private schools will continue to offer this diversity and excellence for Scottish youth.
You have to do it.
John Edwards is director of the Scottish Council of Private Schools.
Lebron debuts with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for the waiters who wish to see LeBron James playing for the first time with Los Angeles Lakers.
The team coach, Like Walton, announced that James will play the early pre-season match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it remains to be decided how many minutes it will play.
âIt will be more than 1 and less than 48â said Walton on the official Lakers website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell posted on Twitter that James would probably play a few minutes.
After the early week training, James was asked about his plans for the six-party Lakers pretemperation.
At this point in my career I don't need pretemperate parties to be ready - he said.
Trump's electoral acts arrive in Virginia, on the YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts a series of campaign rallies tonight at Wheeling, West Virginia.
It will be the first of the 5 scheduled Trump rallies for the next week, including stops in cities affiliated to him like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the standstill confirmation vote for his candidate to cover the Supreme Court's vacancy, Trump intends to gain support for the next half-term election, given that Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when voted in November.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia and how can you see it on the Internet?
Trump's rally at Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for today Saturday, September 29, 2018 at 7 p.m. ET.
You can see Trump's rally in West Virginia following by live broadcast via YouTube.
Trump will probably discuss the issue of the trial held this week to the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, who has become tense over accusations of inappropriate sexual conduct and who keeps the Senate's confirmation vote suspended for a week while the FBI investigates.
But the main goal of this series of mitins is to help Republicans face the November elections with a new impulse.
Therefore, these five myths Trump will give next week have as their goal - dynamizing volunteers and sympathizers as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives - according to Reuters.
-The control of Congress is as important to its agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible towards the campaign season - Reuters told a Trump campaign vocalist who preferred not to be appointed.
Tonight's rally, which will be held at the Wesbanco stadium, could bring together sympathizers from -Ohio and Pennsylvania and get media coverage from Pittsburgh - according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month Trump visits West Virginia, the state in which he won by over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Western Virginia Republican candidate to the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, last in the polls.
\"It's not a good symptom for Morrisey that the president has to come to support him in the polls,\" said Simon Haeder, a polythologist at the University of West Virginia to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows endurance to fight and keep hope alive until individual Sunday parties
After three individual sessions, the Saturday afternoon foursome could have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The impulse oscillating pendulum is a fully invented sports concept but in what sportsmen really believe, and above all in competitions like this one.
So where would they say the impulse is now?
-They had a six point advantage and now they're four, so I guess we're taking that as a little boost - Jordan Spieth said as he was leaving at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has four points of advantage with twelve more at stake.
The Americans, said Spieth, feel that they have a little wind in favour and a lot of what to cheer about, among other things the technique of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each counts with three points of four.
Spieth has proved lethal from the tee to the green and is preaching with the example.
Those gut shouts became stronger as he advanced his round, making a crucial putt to tie the fourth match when he and Thomas were two points below after two.
In getting the putt who made them win the party in 15, he threw a similar scream, the kind of scream that says he believes the American team is not yet out.
\"You just have to concentrate and worry about your game,\" said Spieth.
He's the only one left to these players now.
18 holes to let go.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European couple have four out of four and can't be wrong.
(Moliwood) was the only couple who did not make a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided them on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and not last nine holes on Friday morning.
That walk, and the way it seems to flow its energy into the crowd and from it, confirms them as rivals hitting Sunday, and there could be no more popular players to achieve a victory when setting the sun on Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, talking about European glory remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly dispatched Sergio GarcÃ­a, the morning's furball hero, when he paired up with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first walk ended with Spanish and Swedish in a hole they were never close to leaving.
But on Sunday there will be no one to help get out of the hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to see closely by the interactions between couples, the advice given, those not and the way a strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has a significant advantage on the last day, but this foursome session has also shown that the USA Team has endurance to fight, which some, especially Stateside, doubted.
Europe has an advantage of 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will enjoy a good advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after leaving the fourballs and the foursomes with an advantage of 10-6 over the United States.
The inspired duo made up of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the load with two victories over a Tiger Woods with difficulty climbing four points to the marker at Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who seeks to preserve the trophy they lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated an American team that failed in the morning furballs, putting the 3-1 series.
U.S. offered more resistance in the four games, winning four parties, but they could not cut the advantage.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from the 12 individual Sunday parties to preserve the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novice to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed â Molliwood â after a sensational weekend, are the second couple to win four points of the four early matches in Ryder Cup's history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed into the fourballs, they fit the perfection to defeat a disembarked Woods and the American novice Bryson Dechambeau with a more categorical 5&4.
Woods, who fought two parties on Saturday without penalty or glory, showed occasional bursts of brilliance, but now lost 19 of 29 matches in the fourball and foursome modalities and five followed.
Justin Rose, who had rested in the morning furballs, reconvened as her partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes catching a defeat against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, numbers one and three in the world.
Europe could not always win on a pleasant day of breeze in the southwest of Paris.
Three times champion Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for Americans getting two points on Saturday.
They won a 2&1 victory over Spanish John Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and won again Poulter and Rory McIllroy 4&3 in the foursomes after losing the first two holes.
There was only twice in Ryder Cup's history in which a team raised four points in the individual, though as the current trophy holder, Furyk's team only needs to tie up to keep it.
However, after being the second best in two days, a counterattack on Sunday seems to be out of reach.
North Korea says no to unilateral disarmament if there is no confidence
North Korea's foreign minister informed the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions increased their distrust in the United States and that the country would not deliver its nuclear weapons under those circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho informed the Annual General Assembly that North Korea had adopted - important measures to show its goodwill - last year, such as stopping nuclear tests and missiles, dismantling nuclear test camps and committing itself to the proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
\"However, we don't see the corresponding U.S. response,\" he added.
\"Without confidence in the U.S. there will be no confidence in our national security and, under such circumstances, there will be no unilateral disarmament first on our part\"
While Ri resumed the already well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a \"gradual\" denuclearization by which North Korea would be rewarded as it took action, his statement seemed important, as it did not reject unilateral denuclearization as it had occurred with Pyongyang in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between an active U.S. President and a North Korean leader held in Singapore on June 12, when Kim committed to the \"denuclearization\" of the Korean peninsula - while Trump secured the security of North Korea.
North Korea has long sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has stated that Pyongyang must first deport its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted to relax the harsh international sanctions on North Korea.
\"The United States insists on \"denuclearization first\" and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal of coercive eect, and even oppose the \"declaration of the end of the war\" said Ri.
The perception that sanctions can make us kneel is an impossible dream, for those who don't know us.
But the problem is that the continuing sanctions amounting to our distrust â
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that the American leader mentioned in the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
However, he spoke of three meetings between Kim and the leader of South Korea, Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added, \"If the other part of this issue of denuclearization was South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the coral peninsula would not have come to a dead end--
Still, the tone of Ri's speech was radically different from that of last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly it was inevitable to attack the United States with North Korean missiles after the -- evil president -- Trump called Kim -- a rocket man on a suicide mission.
This year in the UN, Trump, who last year threatened with â completely destroying â North Korea, praised Kim for her bravery in taking measures for disarmament, but said that there is still much work to be done and that sanctions must be maintained until North Korea denuclearizes.
Wednesday Trump said that there was no deadline for that, and that -- equal to two years, three or five months --
China and Russia discuss whether the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
On Thursday, however, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompey told the UN Security Council that, \"The enforcement of Security Council sanctions must continue firmly and without exception until we observe total, final and verified denuclearisation\"
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions in North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to cut funds for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompey met with Ri at the margin of the UN General Assembly and then remarked that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompey has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip did not go well.
He quit Pyongyang in July saying that he had advanced, just a few hours before North Korea denounced him for doing â mafia demands â
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to dismantle a missile deployment, as well as a nuclear complex, if the United States adopted the corresponding \"measures\"
He pointed out that Kim had told him that the - corresponding measures - that he requested were the security assurances Trump promised in Singapore and the advancement towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard Students conduct a course on how to rest enough
This year, a new Harvard University course is making all of its students sleep longer in order to combat the growth of machist culture from studying all night long stimulated by caffeine.
An academic has found that students at university number one in the world often do not know the basics about how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard School of Medicine and specialist at Brigham Hospital and Muller, has conceived the course, which he believes is the first of this kind in the US.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the impact that lack of sleep had on learning.
At the end of the course, a girl approached me and said, 'Why do you only tell me this now, in my last year?'
He said no one had talked to him about the importance of sleeping, which surprised me - he commented to The Telegraph.
The course, which was launched this year for the first time, explains to students the basic aspects of how to acquire good sleep habits helps with academic and athletic performance, as well as improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard School of Medicine and executive director of university health services, stated that the university decided to present the course after discovering that students had a significant lack of sleep during the week.
The course of an hour of duration involves a series of interactive tasks.
In a section there is a picture of a dormitory, where students click on coffee bowls, curtains, trainers, and books to get information about the effects of caffeine and light and how sleep deficit affects athletic performance, as well as the importance of having a routine at bedtime.
In another section, participants are informed of how prolonged lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
We know it won't change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know this information, in the same way that we have the right to know what the health effects are if we opt for smoking tobacco - Professor Czeisler added.
The culture of pride of spending the whole night awake still exists, it states, and adds that modern technology and increasing pressure for students who involved lack of sleep was a growing problem.
Ensuring that he sleeps enough and that he has a good quality sleep must be a student's secret weapon to combat stress, fatigue, and anxiety, he points out, even avoiding weight gain, as lack of sleep causes the brain to go into an insanity mode, which makes him constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after having attended one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to spur a course across campus.
The next step, wait, is to request all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm to lie down, as well as for when they wake up. Similarly, it is advisable to be aware of the harmful effects of the -blue light - which emit electronic screens and LED lighting, which can debalance circadian rhythm and cause trouble sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal takes down Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another sad episode when Dolly Menga's attack relegated Steven Gerrard's disarticulated team to a defeat by 1-0 in Livingston.
Ibrox's team intended to record his first home win since the 4-1 triumph in February at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team resulted in Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as a coach, which left his team eight points from the Hearts, leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership, the Scottish League.
Menga attacked seven minutes before the break and an alignment of the Rangers with little inspiration never gave the feeling that it was tie.
While the Rangers have descended to the sixth post, the Livingston has risen to the third place and is only behind the Hibernian with a goal of difference.
And it could have been much worse for the Rangers after the Calum Spence line judge had to have treated for a head wound after the alleged launch of an object.
Gerrard made eight changes regarding the team that razed the Ayr in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup, the Scottish League Cup.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same 11 of Livingston who pulled a point out to the Hearts last week and would have been delighted with the way his organized set suffocated his opponents at all times.
Rangers may have mastered possession, but Livingston did much more when they had the ball.
They could have scored in just two minutes when Menga's first-time short pass sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's gate, but the midfielder wasted this great opportunity.
A powerful free shot by Keaghan Jacobs arrived at Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, only managed to nail him in the second pole.
The Rangers took control, but it seems they had more hope than conviction about their play in the offensive area.
No doubt Alfredo Morelos felt that they would have had to have punished him at 15 minutes when he and Steven Lawless clashed, but the referee, Steven Thomson, ignored Colombian claims.
The Rangers only performed two shots at the door in the first half, but Ibrox's former bodyguard, Liam Kelly, had barely trouble with the head ending of Lassana Coulibaly and the attack of Ovie Ejaria.
While Livingston's opening at minute 34 could have gone against the logic of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for their hard work.
The Rangers failed again in coping with Jacobs' strong formation.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher boxed the ball for Scott Robinson, who kept the blood cold to choose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard acted at rest when changing to Coulibaly by Ryan Kent, change which almost had an immediate effect when the zord made a pass to Morelos, but the imposing Kelly ran from his line to block it.
But Livingston continued to devour visitors by playing exactly the type of game they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett collecting one long balloon after another.
Holt's team could have broadened the advantage in the final moments, but McGregor stood perfectly up to refuse Jacobs before Lithgow headed from the corner.
Rangers' replacement, Glenn Middleton, claimed another penalty while tangling with Jacobs, but Thomson returned to make the look fat.
Almanaque: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page of our Sunday Morning's navel: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and CONTACT... was the day that the physical future was born Johannes Wilhelm-Hans- Geiger in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led him to the device known as the Geiger counter.
A pier of science since then, the Geiger counter has also become a fundamental element of pop culture, as in the 1950 film \"Bells of Coronado,\" \"The bells of Coronado,\" starring those apparently unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: -What's that in the world -
Rogers:-It is a Geiger counter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When these headphones are put on, the effects of atoms emitted by the radioactivity of minerals can be heard â
Evans:\"Say, I'm sure you're breaking up now\"
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But the invention that bears his name survives.

A similar approach to the removal of immune cells from patients and -signals - addressing cancer cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarked on a speech in favor of Trump when using a MAGA hat (Make America Great Again) after his appearance on the Saturday Night Live (SNL) program.
And the result wasn't good.
During a Saturday Night Live program, Kanye West was beaten up in the studio after a confusing presentation in which he praised US President Donald Trump, and said he would present himself as a candidate in 2020.
After interpreting the third song of the night, called Ghost Town-Phantom City, in which he carried a hat from Make America Great Again, criticized the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
\"I often talk to a white man and say, \"How you might like Trump if he's racist\"
If I were worried about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago - he said.
SNL began the program with a satire featured by Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the U.S. Senate Judicial Committee on the lawsuits for sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not issued, Chris Rock raised West's criticism images to social media.
It is unclear whether Rock was trying to mock West with this publication.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had spent a bad time behind the scenes due to his cap.
- They passed me on the backstage.
They said, 'Don't go out with that hat.'
I was intimidated!
And then they said he was going to pick me up -- said according to Washington Examiner.
West went on: \"You want to see how I'm going to pick up,\" saying that I would - use my superman hat, because it means you can't tell me what to do - Do you want the world to move on?
Try it with love.
His comments provoked applause at the audience at least twice and the members of the SNL cast seemed to be embarrassed, he informed Variety magazine, with the following testimony that a person who was there gave the publication: -The whole studio remained in absolute silence -
They had named West as the last replacement for Ariana Grande, whose old boyfriend, the raper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West has left many people perplexed with an interpretation of the song I love it - I love it -, dressed like a bottle of Perrier water.
West obtained the support of the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote the following tweet:-For one of the most courageous spirits: GRAZES FOR FOUNDING MAFIA .
However, the presenter of an interview program, Karen Hunter, wrote a tweet saying that West was simply to -be who it is and that's completely wonderful -
- So and all, I chose NOT to reward anyone (buying their music or clothing or supporting their (art) - which I think is embracing and spreading an ideology that is prejudicial to my community.
It's free.
Just like we added.
Before the show, the rapist announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now â or was officially known as Kanye West â
He is not the first artist to change his name; he follows Diddy's steps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
Raper Snoop Dogg had the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the last legend of the music, Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then the artist previously known as Prince.

The Public Prosecutor's Service will review the charges.
The star of Game of Thrones, Kit Harington, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword handling role as Jon Snow in the violent fantastic medieval HBO Game of Thrones series.
The 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of machist hero, saying that these roles on the screen translate into what it seems that young people often have to be hard to respect them.
When talking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that - something failed - and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era (#EuTamÃ©n).
Kit, who recently married the co-protagonist of Game of Thrones, also 31-year-old Rose Leslie, admitted to feeling - strong enough - to address the problem.
\"Personally, I feel pretty strong right now, when we're wrong about masculinity,\" he said.
What we teach men when they grow up, in terms of the problem we'll see now--
Kit believes that television can be partially responsible for increasing toxic masculinity thanks to its very masculine characters.
He continued: âWhat is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television and in the streets; what makes young people feel that they have to be that certain part of being a man?
I think it really is one of the big questions of our time; how do we change that?
Because, clearly, something went wrong with the boys.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not make any precuela or sequelae of Game of Thrones when the series comes to its end the next summer, stating that âout of horses and battlefields â
Starting in November, Kit will starve a reposition of True West (The True West), by Sam Shepard, who tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that he considers his encounter with his wife, Rose, was the best of Game of Thrones.
\"I met my wife in this program, so, in a way, she provided me with my future family and my life from here on,\" she said.
Rose played Ygritte, Kit's character's love, Jon Snow, in Emmy's winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 in the land of Leslie's family heritage in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% in new cases
China announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS.
It affects more than 820,000 people in the country, declared the health authorities.
40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted sexually, which marks a change regarding the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly over some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV in this way had been practically reduced to zero, the Chinese health authorities stated at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, in international terms, the number of people living with HIV or AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV poses a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was discriminated against in China in 1997, but they ensure that discrimination against LGBT people has spread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that between 70 and 90% of men who have sexual relations with other men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the disease come from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, China's government has promised universal access to mediation for HIV as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters regrets that a member of the staff leaked data from the Senators of the Republican Party, âdangerous mentorings â and âconspiring theories â
On Saturday, the US representative, Maxine Waters, denounced the allegations that a member of his staff had published personal information from three US Republican Party senators on the Wikipedia pages of legislators.
The Democrat of Los Angeles Democrat stated that the statements were being made by websites and commentators of the \"ultradereita\"
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
According to it, widespread information included the particular addresses and telephone numbers of US Senators Lindsey Graham, from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person at Capitol Hill, the seat of the United States government, during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of inappropriate sexual conduct against the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh.
Filtering appeared a little after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the origin of publications was associated with the Waters department and revealed the information of a Waters staff member, reported the Capitol Hill.
\"This unfounded accusation is totally false and a complete lie,\" Waters continued.
The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information, and security were compromised as a result of these false and fraudulent accusations, was not responsible in any way for the filtration of this information.
This unfounded accusation is totally false and a complete lie-
Waters' statement immediately raised online criticisms, including those of the former White House Press Secretary, Ari Fleischer.
\"This disproved one became angry,\" Fleischer wrote.
It shows that he has no temperament to be a member of Congress.
When they accuse someone of something they didn't do, they shouldn't get angry.
It must not be defiant.
You must not question the accuser's motives.
Must remain calm and serene -
It seemed that Fleischer was comparing Waters' reaction to the criticism of Judge Kavanaugh's Democrats, to which critics accused him of appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who presented himself to disband Waters in the mid-term election, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
\"Very strong if it were true\" he shared in a tweet.
In his statement, Waters said that his department alerted the law enforcement and appropriate authorities of these fraudulent charges.
\"We'll make sure to find out who's guilty,\" he continued, \"so as to be legally held responsible for all his actions that are destructive and dangerous to all and each of my team's members.\"
Criticism by Johnny English Strikes Again (Johnny English: Again in action), the powerless spy parody of Rowan Atkinson
It is already traditional to look for Brexit's transcendence in new films from a British point of view and it seems that this can be applied to the return of the franchise of this parody and action comedy of Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn-Johnny English Returns .
Will the ironic satire become about the subject of the evidently stupid that we are in the nation's new export opportunity?
Either way, Johnny English's incompetent image character jumps and rubber face renewed his license to ruin things for the second time. His name is already a clear indication that it is a general comic creation designed for non-angophone movie territories.
Naturally, it is the stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre pretensions of flattering glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a bit of Mr. Bean's quirk and a piece of that guy who contributed with a single note on the subject of Fire Cars at the London 2012 Olympics opening ceremony.
It is also originally based on the cosmopolitan and mysterious international agent that Atkinson once interpreted in the now forgotten Barclaycard television ads, in which he sowed chaos in his passage.
There are a couple of good moments on Johnny English's last exit.
I love it when Johnny English approaches a helicopter while using a medieval armor suit and the rotor's steps make a brief bang against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy jumps into sight, but gives the impression that humor has little strength and is oddly superfluous, especially when this type of movies - serious - such as 007 and Mission Impossible, already use comedy convincingly as one of their ingredients.
It seems as if humor was directed to children, rather than adults, and, in my opinion, the extravagant miseries of Johnny English are not as clever or concentrated as movie jokes change from Atkinson by embodiing Bean's character.
Now the permanently topical argument is that Britain has serious problems.
A cyber pirate is infiltrated into Britain's supersecret web spy network and reveals the identities of all British agents in the area, for the distress of the agent who is on duty, an unfortunate little role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the height for a pompous and conflicting prime minister, who already suffers a total crisis of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of himself with this character who almost resembles Theresa May, but cannot do much with the script.
His intelligence advisors inform that as all active spies have been committed, you must get someone out of the retreat.
And that refers to the incompetent Johnny English in person, who now works as a teacher in some snob institution, but gives extra-official classes about how to become an infiltrated agent; in this part there are some jokes, when English offers the gymnasium of spies to a rock school.
They take English back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and meet with their former and suffered fellow Bough, re-interpreted by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man with a submarine captain, an enthusiastic role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little lost.
So the Batman and Robin of the Mistakes of His Majesty's Secret Service return to action, meeting with the beautiful fatal wife of Olga Kurylenko, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously succumbing to the charm of the technological charismatic billionaire who claims that he can solve British computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous falsified: disguised as waiters, they set fire to an ostentatious French restaurant; they create a tumult that illegally places them on board Volta's luxury yacht; and English provokes total anarchy in trying to use virtual reality helmets to familiarize themselves with the interior of Volta's house.
Evidently, all arrests come out of that last sequence, but in the kind and scandalous way it is, it seems drawn from a child television program.
The result is fairly regular.
And, as with other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but think: the British film industry can't offer Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talent?
The Labour Party denies that it is designing a plan for the British to work four days a week, but they cover for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan that will make the British work four days a week, but that cover for five
Presumably, the party wants employers to pass the savings achieved through the artificial intelligence revolution (IA) to workers by offering them an additional free day.
In this way, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but would continue to receive the same salary.
The sources say the idea would - would - be adjusted - to the party's economic agenda and its plans to tilt the country in favor of the workers.
The Trade Union Congress supported the four-day shifts per week as a measure for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
An important source of the Labour Party told The Sunday Times:-It is hoped that a policy review will be announced before the end of the year.
-It won't happen from day to night, but a four-day work week is an ambition that adjusts to the party's approach to balancing the economy in favour of the worker, as well as the general industrial strategy of the party -
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day work week during its campaign for the 2017 general election.
Thus and all, the Labour Party currently does not support ambition in its entirety.
A Labour Party spokesman said, \"A four-day working week doesn't go into party politics and isn't being considered by this one.\"
The chancellor in the shade, John McDonnell, used the Labour Party's conference last week to reinforce his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of the -anonymous directors - and the - speculators - in public service companies.
The chancellor's plans in the shadow also involve the possibility that current shareholders of water companies will not recover all their investment, as a laborist government could perform â deductions â the cause of perceived irregularities.
It also confirmed plans to place workers on business councils and create inclusive ownership funds to deliver 10% of private sector business shares to employees, which pay annual dividends of up to Â£500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell the -60 Minutes - if the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could make them change their mind
FBI investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed at least a week's final vote on his appointment for the Supreme Court.The question is raised as to whether the department's findings could influence for Republican senators to withdraw his support.
On Sunday, in the broadcast of an interview, the reporter of the -60 Minutes - Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring something into the light that would lead them to change their mind.
Kennedy showed himself more open than his South Carolina colleague.
\"I mean, of course,\" said Kennedy.
I said I'd go to the audience, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the charge came out and asked him if he had done it.
It was firm, determined, round -
However, Graham's vote seems to be unmovable.
\"My opinion of Brett Kavanaugh is determined and would make an explosive charge,\" he said.
\"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened; but I know the following: Brett flatly denied it -- he added Graham in reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
And the people you mentioned couldn't verify it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and did something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that has an impressive star cartel that will act and an equally impressive mission, ending global poverty.
In his seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see thousands of people head to the Central Park's Great Lawn Area, not only to enjoy performances such as those of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the real goal of the event to end poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project (Global Project against Poverty), an international support group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who actively combat it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), the wizard audience had to complete a series of tasks or -actions - such as making a volunteer, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or any other significant way to help raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
But what is the degree of success achieved by Global Citizen at 12 years of achieving its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a genuine way of persuading people to request action or is it just another case of so-called âclictivismâ people who think that makes a difference when signing an online request or when sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has reported that it has registered over 19 million (actions) of its followers, driving a different set of goals.
It claims that these actions have helped to stimulate world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to over $37 billion established to influence the lives of more than 2250 million people before 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements derived from their shares, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that so far the guaranteed funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition (The Power of Nutrition), a UK investor and executor society that has committed to âhelp children develop to their maximum potential â with the promise to provide Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4700 tweets from Global Citizen.
With the support of the UK government, the donors, the national authorities and the supporters of Global Citizen like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a footnote to history - the mob was told the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, during a live concert in April 2018 in London.
The group also said that after more than 5000 actions were carried out in favor of improving the nutrition of mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funding for the The Power of Nutrition project that will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on your website, -what makes you think we can end extreme poverty -,
Global Citizen has replied, \"It will be a long and difficult path and, at times, we will fall and fail.
But, in the same way that it happened to the big anti-apartheid movements and in favor of the civil rights that precede us, we will achieve it, because together, we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae are some of the artists who will perform at this year's event in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the navy to carry out a \"blocking\" to make energy exports from Russia difficult, the US Secretary of Interior announced
-If necessary - Washington may resort to the navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching the markets, including the Middle East one, unveiled the US Secretary of Interior, Ryan Zinke, according to Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's commitment to Syria, especially where it operates at instances of legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
\"I think the reason they're in the Middle East is they want to negotiate with energy in the same way they did in Eastern Europe,\" he said, as reported.
Furthermore, according to the officer, they have the forms and means to confront him.
âThe United States has the ability, along with the navy, to ensure that the sea lanes are open and, if necessary, to block them to ensure that their energy does not go to the market - he said.
Zinke thus addressed the participants of the event organized by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that is called himself as the \"energy consumer voice\" in the US.
He compared Washington's strategies to deal with Russia and Iran, bearing in mind that, in practice, it is the same.
âThe economic option in Iran and Russia consists, more or less, of taking advantage of and replacing fuels - he commented, while referring to Russia by saying that - he only has a tactic - with an economy dependent on hydrocarbons.
The statements were made while Trump's administration was on a mission to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, in order to replace Russia's, the most economical option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump's administration officials, including the president himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the -inadequate - North Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, turned Berlin into -incaptive -of Moscow -
Moscow repeatedly stressed that the North Stream pipeline 2 of $11 billion, which was established to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a mere economic project.
The Kremlin argued that Washington's fervent opposition to the project is only argued for economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
\"I think we share the idea that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,\" said the Russian Minister of Energy, Aleksandr Novak, after meeting with the US Energy Secretary, Rick Perry, who took place in September in Moscow.
The US stance got Germany's reaction, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German industry leader organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI, for its German acronyms), appealed to the US to move away from the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
- I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply - said Dieter Kempf, president of the BDI, after a recent meeting between the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will carefully examine her nomination to the presidency by 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said that he would carefully examine his candidacy to the presidency after the middle-term election.
During a public assembly in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidacy.
\"It's time for women to go to Washington and repair the fractured government and that includes a woman in power,\" he said, according to The Hill.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Warren thought about President Donald Trump during the public assembly, claiming he was taking this country by the wrong leadership.
\"I'm very worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,\" he said.
Warren was frank in his criticisms to Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren commented on a tweet â of course an FBI investigation is necessary before the vote â
However, in a survey published on Thursday, it was shown that most Warren's own electors do not believe that it will be presented by 2020.
Fifty percent of the \"probable\" voters in Massachusetts said that the senator would not submit her candidacy, according to the survey of the Suffolk University Political Research Centre and the Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported that candidacy.
The survey showed further support for the former governor's candidacy, Deval Patrick, with a 38 percent support for a possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other prominent names of Democrats in connection with a possible nomination by 2020 include the former vice president, Joe Biden, and the Senator of Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide it officially before January, reported the agency Associated Press.
Sarah Palin cites the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTTE) of Track Palin in Donald Trump's mitin
26-year-old Track Palin spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September
On Monday night, he was arrested and accused of an incident of domestic violence.
\"With what my own son is going through, with what is happening again, I can see myself reflected in other families who feel the consequences of the PTSD and some of the wounds with which our soldiers return,\" explained to the audience at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin said that his arrest was a taboo topic and that his son and other war veterans, - turn different, hardened, wondering if there is respect for what militia and aviators companions, as well as other army members, offered to the country -
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman, which interferes with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon at the same time as he was drunk, according to Dan Bennett, spokesperson of the Wasilla police department.
18 states and the District of Columbia challenge the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a judicial remedy in connection with a new U.S. policy denying asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence or criminal organizations.
On Friday, the representatives of 18 states and the district presented a friendly report from the court in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenges the policy, reported NBC News.
The full name of the plaintiff party of Grace's Pretence Sessions v. that the American Civil Liberties Union (Uniden Union for Civil Liberties) filed in August against federal policy was not revealed.
He told that his couple - and his children members of a violent criminal organization - abused her, but that the U.S. officials rejected her application for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The lawyers in the states supporting Grace described The Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum seekers for the US, such as nations facing generalized problems with criminal organizations and related to domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy revoked a 2014 Board of Immigration Appeals decision that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Columbia District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy - ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation -
-Federal legislation requires all asylum applications to be adjudicated according to the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and that prohibition infringes that principle - it was explained in the friendly report of the court.
Taxation continued to debate in the report that the policy that rejects the entry of immigrants damages the U.S. economy, explaining that it is likely to become entrepreneurs and that -they provide hands-on work-
In June, the Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, ordered immigration judges not to grant more asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and violence from criminal organizations.
(The asylum is available to those who abandon their country due to persecution or fear on grounds of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion) said Sessions in their policy announcement on June 11.
Asylum has never been meant to alleviate all the problems (including all the serious problems) that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the number of victims doubles in a race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation was becoming more and more frequent.
\"The circumstances are very tense,\" says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her febrile baby in the evacuation center of the abbot town of Palu.
Every minute an ambulance arrives with bodies.
And clean water is scarce.
Residents were seen returning to their homes destroyed, collecting their belongings drowned, trying to save anything they found.
There are hundreds of wounded people and hospitals, damaged by magnitude 7.5 earthquake, are overwhelmed.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who fractured their backs and shoulders, rested outside Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to continuous and strong replicas.
The tears filled his eyes as he explained how he felt the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save us.
The ruins of the wall crushed me, I think - Haris told Associated Press, and added that his family was on a wedding in the city.
- I heard my wife ask for help and then just be quiet.
I don't know what happened to her or my daughter.
I hope they're safe.
The US ambassador accuses China of abusing propaganda ads
A week after a Chinese official newspaper had published a four-page advertisement in a US newspaper praising the benefits of trade between USA and China, the US ambassador in China accuses Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, referred to the payment supplement China Daily in Des Moines Register, the best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of interfering in the elections to the U.S. Congress, which will be held on November 6, fact that China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to get in the US election, marked what officials of that country had coined in Reuters as a new phase of a growing Washington campaign to coerce China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in a growing trade war witness to tariff levelling in their respective imports.
According to China and US experts, China's compensatory tariffs at the beginning of the commercial war were designed to prejudice state exporters such as Iowa, which supports the Trump Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, one of the leading exporters of agricultural products to China, stated that Beijing has prejudiced workers, farmers and North American entrepreneurs.
In an opinion article written by Branstad and published in the Moines Register Sunday edition, it has been explained that China - is intensifying that harassment campaign by spreading propaganda advertisements in the free US press -
-To spread their propaganda, the Chinese government takes advantage of the well-known American tradition of freedom of expression and of the press when publishing a payment announcement in Des Moines Register - Branstad wrote.
âOn the contrary, at the station of newspapers located at the end of this Beijing street, they are few to dissenting voices and no real reflection of the disparate opinions that the Chinese may have on China's worrying economic trajectory, since the media are under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party - adds.
Even so, he states that â one of the most important journals in China has declined the offer of publishing â his article, although he has not confirmed what journal it is about.
Kavanaugh disaster causes women's Republican vote to be lost within a few days of the half-term election
Although many of the leading Republicans support and defend Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, despite the different accusations of sexual assaults, analysts warn of a violent reaction, particularly from female voters, in the next half-term elections.
The reactions around these accusations were numerous and most Republicans positioned themselves to continue with the vote.
\"These things can't be undone,\" said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University in an article published on Sunday in The Hill.
Reeher also stated that he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) last hour for an FBI investigation would be sufficient to calm the moods of angry voters.
- Women will not forget what happened yesterday, as will not forget it in the near future nor in November - reflected on Friday Karine Jean-Pierre, main advisor and national spokesperson of the Progressive Group MoveOn, in the Washington Journal, D.C.
On Friday morning, the opponents, to the flu of \"Arcasse Novembre\", manifested themselves in the Senate corridor, while Republicans, with the control of the Judicial Committee, decided to move on with the appointment of Kavanaugh, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, reported Mic.
-The motivation and enthusiasm of the Democrats will overcome any expectation - it has secured to the Stu Rothenberg notification site, a neutral political analyst.
\"It's true, it's high enough.\"
but it will still be more, especially among the undecided voting women of the neighborhoods on the outskirts or those who are between 18 and 29 years old, who although they do not like the President, do not usually go to the polls -
Before Ford's public testimony had detailed his accusations of sexual assault against Supreme Court candidates, analysts suggested that it was possible to suffer a violent reaction if Republicans continued with confirmation.
\"This became a disaster for the Republican Party,\" said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of the week on the NBC News channel.
This goes beyond the committee's vote, the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will sit at the defendant's bank or not.The problem is how the Republicans managed this and how they dealt with it - Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, a group that helps the Democratics' election on the news channel.
However, it seems that Americans are divided between whether Ford's testimony or Kavanaugh's testimony, although they are more inclined to support the latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41% of the respondents totally or probably believe Ford's testimony, versus 35% supporting Kavanaugh's testimony.
Furthermore, 38 % believes that Kavanaugh is most likely to lie during his testimony, compared to 30 % who thinks the same of Ford.
Following pressure exerted by Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the charges filed by Ford, as well as those of at least another accuser, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate's Judicial Committee under oath that Kavanaugh attacked her in a state of ebriety when she was 17 years old.
On the contrary, Ramirez alleges that the Supreme Court candidate showed him the genitals at a college party when he was studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The creator of the World Wide Web wants to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of this technology legend, is a Solid based company, Berners-Lee's open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and what people can access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee chanced that the intention hiding Inrupt is -dominating the world -
\"We have to do it,\" he said about the startup.
\"This is a historic moment.\"
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own âa personal data store online â or POD.
Contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music, and other personal and professional tools may be included.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify were available in a single browser at the same time.

Homage to Bernard Vann, clergyman decorated with the Victoria Cross in World War I
The only clergyman of the Church of England who was decorated with the Victoria Cross during World War I received a posthumous homage in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded on September 29, 1918, in the attack of Bellenglyse and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later without getting to know that he had been granted the greatest British military decoration.
On Saturday, his two grandsons were in charge of discovering a commemorative monument in their honor in a parade in Rushden (Northhamptonshire).
Michael Vann, one of his grandsons, highlighted the symbolism of discovering this monument just 100 years after his grandfather's pheasant who deserved his title.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann directed his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal - through a dense fog and under the yoke of an intense machine gunfire -
He later hurried to reach the line of fire and, with a -- great courage -- directed the line forward before rushing with a cannon and no one's help, and knocked down three people from the enemy detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war ended.
72-year-old Michael Vann stated that his grandfather's actions are â something he could never live with, but a lesson still â
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also placed a crown of flowers after the parade, which headed the junior Brentwood Imperial band.
Michael Vann said to feel - I am honored to participate in the parade - and added that - the value of this genuine hero demonstrates it the support of so many people -
Peppa Pig cuts the roll to MMA fans at the best time
Imagine that you've been awake all night to enjoy Bellator's 206 full show, and when it comes to the best part something prevents you.
San Jose cartel included 13 fights, six being the main ones, and was broadcasting live in United Kingdom at Channel 5.
But at 6:00 a.m., just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were to see the faces, viewers in the UK were puzzled when they saw Peppa Pig appear.
Some were not impressed after they had spent so many hours awake waiting to see the fight.
An amateur described the change to these childish cartoons on Twitter as \"a joke of very bad taste\"
The state regulation states that that content was not appropriate for 6:00 a.m., and that's why it had to change to child programming - Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of Marketing and Bellator's Communication, explained, when asked about the retransmission.
\"Peppa Pig, that's it.\"
Scott Coker, President of Bellator, stated that they will take UK viewers into account in future programming.
\"I think we can solve it when we think about the repetition,\" Coker said.
-But if it's 6:00 a.m. there, we can't solve it until Sunday, which will be Monday for them.
But we're working to find a solution.
When the change occurred I began to receive many messages and not all were pleasant.
We were trying to solve it because we thought it was a technical mistake.
But no, it was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen again.
We'll limit ourselves to five fights, instead of six, we'd like to give our fans the best, but we'll spend and
much damage to anger â
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior due to her sexuality
Tom Daley, an Olympic skipper, claims he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but this made him find the motivation to triumph.
This 24-year-old athlete states that he did not realize that not everyone was like him until he got to high school.
Invited from the first broadcast of the Desert Island Discs Radio 4 program led by Lauren Laverne, he explained that he began talking about homosexual rights to give hope to others.
He also shared that the fact of being a parent helped him to relativize the importance of winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the usual presenter of this program, is down by illness.
As a guest of Laverne's first-led program, Daley shared that he was feeling - inferior - to the rest of the people because - it wasn't socially acceptable that you liked children and girls -
He also stated that: \"To this day, that feeling of inferiority and of being different is what prompted me and gave me the necessary strength to achieve success\"
I wanted to show that it was â someone â so that people wouldn't feel disappointed in discovering their sexuality.
With two bronze Olympic medals, he became a prominent LGBT activist and used his appearance in the Commonwealth of Australia games to ask more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He decided to speak because he felt fortunate to be able to live openly and without fear of repercussions, and wanted to give hope to others.
Three times the world champion said to fall in love with the American director Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, - it was quite a surprise -
Daley married this winner of an Oscar last year and states that the 20 years of difference between them have never been a problem.
-When you live so much in such a short time - (with only 14 years of participation for the first time in an Olympic Games and your father died of cancer three years later), it is difficult to find someone your age who had experienced similar altybasis.
The couple had their first child in June, Robert Ray Black-Daley, and this birth made Daley totally change their perspective.
\"If you asked me last year, my greatest motivation would be to win a gold medal,\" he says.
-But now I know there are much more important things than an Olympic gold medal.
For me, my medal is Robbie -
His son bears the name of his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 because of a brain cancer.
Daley's father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked his son to do were entrances to London 2012, he wanted to be in the front row.
\"I couldn't tell you I wouldn't be here to occupy that first row,\" Daley shared.
\"He was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and it was at that precise moment, at the time of his death, when I realized that he really wasn't invincible - he added.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
\"At that time I knew that was the dream of my life: jumping in front of a crowd in my country participating in the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling - it confirms.
The choice of Heather Small's Proud song is not in vain either, as it is the melody that accompanied him during his preparation for the Olympics and still sets his hairs on tip.

A low-shaped Mickelson ended up in Ryder Cup's bank this Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will hit a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Party of the Ryder Cup, but he will need to improve his technique so that this does not become an unfortunate event.
Mickelson, who participates in the biennial event for 12th time, stayed at the bank by decision of Captain Jim Furyk and could not participate in the fourballs or the Saturday forts.
Instead of being the center of action, as so many other times for America, the five times champion spent the day cheering and working to improve his movements.
Although it was never the most accurate of players, not even at the heightened moment of their career, their 48 years does not fit the adjusted Le Golf National field, where tall grass usually punish the wrong shots.
And as long as this was not enough, Mickelson faces the ninth Sunday match to the precise Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, who has joined Tommy Fleetwood to win the four games this week.
If Americans, four points below when starting the 12 individual parties, start with good foot, Mickelson's performance could be totally crucial.
Furyk trusted his man, though he couldn't say much more.
He understood to perfection the role he played today, gave me a slap on my shoulder, handed me my arm, and told me that tomorrow he would be ready - he shared Furyk.
He trusted himself fully.
It has a prominent place in the Hall of Fame and contributed a lot to the teams in the past and this week.
I probably hadn't thought I'd played two games.
I thought I'd play more, but in the end that's the way it is, and so we thought it was supposed to be.
Like everyone else, he wants to be out there--
On Sunday, Mickelson will overcome Nick Faldo's record in the largest number of games played in the Ryder Cup.
He could mark the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, a career that never reached the level of his individual palm tree.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats, and seven halves, although Furyk states that his presence also provides intangibles to the team.
\"He's a fun, sarcastic person, with engineering and he likes to mess with people, he's a good guy to have on the team,\" he explained.
- I like to see how well the younger players spent with him this week.
It's a lot more with a good player;
The Captain of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, fears the disappearance of the advantage
Thomas Bjorn, the European Captain, knows from experience that a considerable advantage in the last day of Ryder Cup individuals can easily become an annoying trip.
The Great Danes debuted in 1997 at a match in Valderrama, where a team captained by Seven Ballesters had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but ended up reaching the goal line with a minimal advantage winning 141â2-131â2.
âYou are still thinking that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; just like in Brookline, where we lost, but in Valderrama we won little by little - think Bjorn, in the photo, after seeing the 2018 promotion win 5-3 on Friday and, yesterday, 10-6 on Le Golf National.
History shows that this is not yet over.
Tomorrow you have to go to all of them.
You have to go out and do the right thing.
This is not over until the points are in the bookmark.
Our goal is to win that trophy, and we have to focus on it.
I won't get tired of saying it, I'm focused on our 12 players who are on our side, but I'm also very aware of what's on the other side: the best players in the world --
Enchanted with the performance of his players on a hard golf course, Bjorn added:-I would never sing victory before time.
Tomorrow we face the other beast.
Tomorrow is the day of individual performances, and then we also have to prove our worth.
It's great to be with a partner next door when things go well, but when you face things in an individual way, then put your skills as a golfer to the maximum test.
That is the message you need to convey to players, who get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind, and he must also get the best out of himself--
Bjorn's difference, Jim Furyk will look for their players to have a better individual performance than with their peers, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points of four.
Furyk himself has been on both ends of those last day spins, being part of the winning team at Brookline, but ending up as a loser in the European miracle in Medinah -
\"I remember each of the damn words,\" he answered when he was asked if he remembered how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had gathered the players towards the last day.
We have 12 major matches, but you'd like to have a quick start like Brookline's or Medinah's.
When you see the impulse going in a direction, there is a lot of pressure in those intermediate parties.
We prepare our alignment taking this into account and place players as we thought, we want to do magic tomorrow â
Thomas has the task of trying to lead the fight and face Rory McIllroy in the first match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans, in the top half of the ranking.
-I've decided this order because I think it covers all the way - Bjorn explained about his selection for the individual.
Germany's new warship postponed once more
The youngest frigate of the German Navy should have been delivered in 2014, to replace the old warships of the Cold War era, but it will not arrive until at least next year due to defective systems and at increasing cost, local media have been reported.
The \"Rheinland-Pfalz\" is the leader ship of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to which a military spokesperson to the newspaper Die Zeit.
The ship should have been incorporated into the Navy in 2014, but post-delivery problems have affected the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg class ships, which the Navy commissioned in 2007, will replace the former Bremen class frigates.
They are understood to have a powerful cannon, with different anti-hero missiles and anti-bulks, as well as with hidden technology, such as reduced radar, infrared, and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, it should be possible to drop the younger frigates up to two years outside the ports of origin.
However, as Die Zeit points out, these continuous delays mean that the warships with the latest technology, and that they will allow Germany to project their power abroad, will be outdated when they enter service.
The unfortunate frigate F125 was reported last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a builder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind this return, but German media spoke of \"crucial flaws in software and hardware\" which prevented the use of the warship on a combat mission.
Software defects were particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of 120 sailors; i.e. half of the necessary staff in the old Bremen class frigates.
Furthermore, it was found that the ship had a dramatic excess weight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add improvements in the future.
Rheinland-Pfalz of 7 thousand tons is thought to weigh twice as much as the similar class ships that the Germans used in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the total project price, which includes crew training, is also becoming a problem.
It is claimed that it already reaches the amazing amount of 3100 million euros, compared to the initial 2200 million.
The problems of the younger frigates are particularly important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is making waters.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the Navy is running out of ships fit to derail.
The officer states that this problem is increasing, as old ships have been removed, but not replaced by others.
Even so, he regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates could join the Navy.
National Trust spys on the secret life of bats
A new research being carried out on a farm in the Highlands of Scotland aims to reveal how bats use the landscape to search for food.
The results are expected to shed light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
This study led by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland association will follow bats Pipistrellus pygmaeus and Pipistrellus pipistrellus, as well as bats Myotis daubentonii and Plecotus auratus in the Inverewe gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment will be placed at key locations around the property to keep track of bats activities during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys with manual detectors.
An audio analysis conducted by experts of all recordings will determine the frequency of the bat calls and what each species is doing.
Next, a habitat map will be developed to create a detailed picture of the landscape scale of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Conservation Advisor, expects the results to show which habitat areas are most important to bats and how they use each of the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of grasslands and what is the best way to keep forests for bats and other associated species.
Morcego populations in Scotland and throughout the UK have decreased considerably in the last century.
These animals overcome threatened by construction and development works that affect children and loss of habitat.
Aerogenerators and lighting also pose a risk, as well as trappings with glue for flies, some chemical treatments of building materials and domestic cat attacks.
The bats aren't blind,
but because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when hunting.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to locate insects and obstacles in their flight trajectory.
The NTS, which is responsible for caring for over 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens and 76 000 hectares of land throughout the country, is taken very seriously by bats.
It has ten trained experts, who conduct periodic surveys, inspections of children and, on occasion, even rescues.
The organization has even the only and first Scottish bat stock in Three Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
David Thompson, the Estate Manager, states that this is the ideal territory for them.
\"In Thrave we have a large area for bats,\" he states.
We count on old buildings, historical trees and a wonderful habitat.
But there are many things that we still don't know about bats, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us better understand what they need to prosper --
It emphasizes the importance of controlling the presence of bats before performing maintenance tasks on the properties, as it is possible that the involuntary destruction of a single maternity baby can kill up to 400 females and offspring, which could exterminate a whole local population.
Bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill, harass, or molest them, as well as destroy their children.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish official of the Bat Conservation Trust organization, encourages people to help:
\"There's still much left to learn about bats and, in the case of many of the species, we don't know how it's going to its populations.\"
Ronaldo dismisses the lawsuits for rape and his lawyers prepare to sue for German publication
Cristiano Ronaldo qualifies the allegations of rape against him as false, claiming that the only thing people want is to get to know each other using their name.
His lawyers will sue the German magazine Der Spiegel for publishing these charges.
The lead of Portugal and Juventus was accused of violating Kathryn Mayorga, an American woman, in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is claimed that the footballer paid the woman 375 000 USD so that she had not said anything about the incident, Der Spiegel published on Friday.
Hours after his release, Ronaldo, 33 years old, shut down this fake news on a live video from his Instagram account, which counts 142 million followers.
- No, not a thousand times.
What was said today is false - he stated before the camera the five times winner of the Gold Ball.
People want to get to know each other using my name.
It's normal,
They want to be famous with just saying my name, it's part of my job.
I am a happy and respectable man - added the player smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers prepare to sue Der Spiegel for charges, which they qualify as - an inadmissible statement of suspicions in the privacy area - according to Reuters.
Counsel Christian Schertz said that the player would seek compensation for â moral damages for an amount corresponding to the severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious infringements of the personal rights of the past few years â
The alleged incident would have occurred in June 2019, in a suite at the Palm Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga would have returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her on an annual basis, according to the documents presented at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo, after the alleged incident, knelt down saying he was 99 % a knight, but that 1 % had betrayed him.
The documents ensure that Ronaldo confirms that both maintained consented sexual relations by both parties.
Mayorga also maintains that he went to the police and that he had photographs of the wounds, but later accessed an extra-judicial agreement because he felt terrified by the reprisals and was worried about the public scorn.
The 34-year-old woman says she seeks to revoke the agreement while continuing traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged crime, Ronaldo was about to meet with Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer the Italian giant Juve was incorporated into an agreement of 100 million euros.
Brexit: Automobile manufacturers would abandon the United Kingdom
The United Kingdom would forever regret the loss of its post as world leader in automobile manufacturing behind Brexit, according to business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it is worrying that Toyota UK had stated on the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily halt the production of its Burnaston factory, near Derby.
\"It's necessary to come to an agreement,\" Clark added.
The Japanese automobile manufacturer stated that, in the event that Brexit had not reached any agreement, the impact of delays on the border might cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, responsible for manufacturing the Toyota Auris and Avensis models, produced some 150 000 vehicles last year, of which 90 % was exported to the rest of the EU.
(In my opinion, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will be witnessing how production stops at our factory - said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota at Burnaston.
Other automobile manufacturers in the UK also expressed their fear of leaving the EU without reaching agreement on the functioning of border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW confirmed that it would close its Mini plant at Oxford one month after Brexit.
One of the main concerns of automobile manufacturers is the risk of supply chain in case an agreement is not reached in Brexit.
Toyota's production line is very tight, every 37 minutes pieces of UK and EU suppliers arrive for custom-made automobiles.
If on 29 March, the United Kingdom leaves the EU without reaching an agreement, the border could be affected and delays and shortage of pieces could result.
The company claims that it would be impossible for Toyota to maintain a normal pace more than one day at the Derbyshire plant, so production would have to stop.
Clark states that Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is â accurately balanced to avoid such border controls â
- It is essential to have an agreement, and we want it to be the best agreement, so that we can enjoy the current success but also make the most of this opportunity - said in BBC Radio 4's Today program.
-The Toyota and other manufacturers experience is that it is necessary to continue these excellent supply chains -
Toyota could not estimate how long production would stop, but warned that in the long term added costs would reduce the plant's competition and could even cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, Burnaston's employee for 24 years and United Union trade union coordinator, said that his members are increasingly worried: \"By experience, I know that once these jobs disappear, they never return.
A spokesperson for the government stated that they presented a precise and credible plan for the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the EU.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be re-appeared
The White House stated that Donald Trump's high-risk meeting and the Deputy Secretary of Justice Rosenstein could be delayed one more week due to the struggle for Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special lawyer Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in elections, links between Russia's assistants and Trump, and the possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Both if Trump dismisses the Deputy Attorney General, and if he does not, which would endanger Mueller's independence, he fed the rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein spoke of using a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of dismissing the President through the 25th amendment.
However, Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he came to the White House, among reports indicating he was about to resign.
In contrast, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was found in New York on Thursday.
Trump claimed he would prefer not to have to dismiss Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a clash with the Senate's judicial committee hearing in which they testified Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women accusing him of inappropriate sexual conduct.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week investigation into the FBI's allegations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the vote in the Senate.
Sarah Sanders, Trump's press secretary, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
In front of the question about the meeting with Rosenstein, he answered, \"There is not yet a fixed date, it could be this week or be delayed one more week, given all that is going on in the supreme court.
We'll see, but you know I like the press being informed --
Some journalists have questioned that statement, as Sanders has been leading since September 10 without holding a press round.
When the presenter Chris Wallace asked him why,
Sanders claimed that the lack of informational session was not due to an aversion to the granuloquence of reporters, although he added that it will not be she who denies that attitude.
He also suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
(The president grants more interviews than the previous president) said, although he did not quote any source to assess those data.
Information meetings will continue, Sanders said, but he insisted that -if the press has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States directly, that is far better than addressing the questions to her.
You are witnesses of how we have been doing this for the past few weeks, and that will replace a press round in which you can speak directly to the President of the United States -
Trump often answers questions when leaving the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
However, the press conferences alone are scarce.
Perhaps the president showed the motive this week in New York, with a free appearance and on strange occasions before the assembled journalists.
A letter from the Health Secretariat to calm the moods before Brexit
The Health Secretariat addressed a letter to EU workers in the NHS in Scotland in which it expresses the country's gratitude and communicates its desire to remain in the country after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter within six months of the United Kingdom leaving the EU.
The Scottish government has undertaken to cover the cost of the covered status applications for EU citizens working in their decentralized public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote, \"During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on abandonment continued, and it is planned to reach the decisions this fall.
However, the UK government, for its part, also intensified its preparations for a possible non-agreement situation.
I know this is a period of restlessness for everyone.
That is why I want to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each of the staff members, regardless of their nationality.
Fellows of the European Union and beyond, provide an indisputable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here with us -
Christion Abercrombie undergoing emergency surgery after a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, linebacker of the Tennessee State Tigers, was subjected to an emergency surgery after suffering a head injury during the defeat of the Sabbath (31-27) against the Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Rod Reed, the coach of the Tennessee State, informed journalists that the injury occurred shortly before rest.
Apparently, he fainted when he reached the band line.
Coaches and medical staff gave him oxygen on the band line before taking him on a camel to perform a later evaluation.
A Tennessee State technician informed Chris Harris, WSMV journalist at Nashville (Tennessee), that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Similarly, he added that there are still no details of the type or scope of the injury, and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when such an injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a red T-shirt second-year student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five entries in total on Saturday before leaving the party, which raised to 18 his total of the season.
A stamp tax will be applied to foreign buyers buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax when they buy a property in the UK. This additional money will be used to help homeless people by virtue of the new conservative plans.
This measure will neutralize the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters
Increased stamp tax will apply to people who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Treasury hopes to raise up to Â£120 million a year to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax when they buy a property in the UK. Theresa May will announce that this additional money will be used to help homeless people.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters with promises to promote more accessible housing and focus on people with high incomes.
The increase in timbre tax will apply to people and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the money raised will serve to support the Government's campaign to reduce the number of people sleeping on the street.
The surcharge, which is added to the current stamp tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago for the second dwellings and purchases to rent, may be up to 3 %.
Faendera hopes that the change will be able to raise up to Â£120 million a year.
Approximately 13% of new constructions held in London are purchased by non-residents in the UK, which is causing an increase in prices and making it difficult for people who wish to buy a housing for the first time to have more difficulty accessing the real estate market.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become - ghost cities - because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy applies just weeks after Boris Johnson applied for the application of a cut in the farm transmission tax to help new people acquire their first home.
He accused the large builders of keeping the prices of high housing by buying and not using this land, and urged Mrs May to remove the percentages of tax revenue on moderate-priced homes to fix the - shame of the housing sector - which is lived in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn announced an attractive series of reform proposals in connection with housing, including the control of renters and the prohibition of evictions in which the tenant is not guilty.
He also wants to grant the municipalities greater powers when building new housing.
Mrs. May stated, \"Last year I said that I would devote my mandate to restoring the British dream: that life should be better for every new generation.
And for that it is necessary to fix the disastrous housing market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and start a life here.
However, it is not fair that it is equally simple for those people who do not live in the UK, as well as for companies based abroad, to buy housing than for British workers residents.
For too many people, the dream of being owners of a dwelling is too far away, and the indignity that supposes not having a roof remains too real -
Jack Ross: \"My last ambition is to be able to train Scotland.\"
Sunderland's manager, Jack Ross, has stated that his (last ambition) consists of becoming Scotland's selectionist at some point.
This 42-year-old Scotch is enjoying the challenge of reviving the northwest club, which currently occupies the third square in League One, three points away from the head.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
When I was a player, my dream was to play for my country.
I played once in selection B, and that was all - Ross declared to the BBC Scots Sportsound program.
I thought I saw Scotland play in Hampden many times with my father when he was a child, something I always wanted to live again.
But that opportunity will only come if I succeed in running a club--
Among Ross' predecessors in Sunderland's coaching office are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of the Alloa Athletic states that he felt no concern about succeeding such consolidated figures in such a large club after he had previously rejected proposals from the Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
âWill success for me at this time depend on if I can return this club to the Premier League?
Because the structure and facilities of the club are undoubtedly owned by a Premier League club - he claimed.
\"It won't turn out to be a simple task to arrive, but it's likely that I'm just considering that I've reached success here if I can return the club to the Premier\"
Ross has only been a coach for three years after a period of assistant at Dumbarton and a period of 15 months within the technical staff of Hearts.
In that period he helped the Alloa recover from the descent to the third division and managed to get the St Mirren from being about to come down to win the title of the Championship the next season.
Ross claims to feel more comfortable now than ever before during his Clyde player career, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academical.
\"I was probably at a real crossroads,\" he recalled, \"about taking over the Alloa.
I really thought training was perfect for me, even more than playing.
It sounds weird because it didn't hurt me, I reasonably earned my life and enjoyed some successes.
But playing can be hard.
There are many things you must overcome every week.
I continue to suffer from them in relation to stress and pressure from work, but training I like it.
I've always liked training and now that I'm doing it, I feel more comfortable than ever in my adult life --
You can hear the full interview at Sportsound on Sunday, September 30 in Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 (British summer time)
According to a survey, the perfect time to take a painting is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday
Summer heat strike increased consumption in British pubs with more difficulty, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars experienced 2.7 percent growth during July, but consumption in restaurants decreased by 4.8 percent according to the figures.
Peter Martin, a member of the CGA commercial consultancy, tasked with compiling the figures, stated:-The sunny days and the permanence of England in the world of football for longer than expected resulted in a pattern similar to that of June, in which pubs enjoyed an increase of 2.8 percent in consumption, although restaurants suffered an even greater punishment.
The decline of 1.8 percent in the turnover of restaurants during June worsened during July.
Drink-specialized pubs and bars were the ones that best results obtained with increases in consumption higher than reductions experienced by restaurants.
Food-specialized pubs also suffered the sun, although not as dramatically as restaurant operators.
It looks like people just wanted to go out drinking.
In controlled pubs and bars consumption of beverages increased by 6.6 percent during the month, and that of meals was reduced by about three percent -
Paul Newman, an employee of the RSM company for leisure and hospitality activities analysis, stated: -These results assume a continuation of the trend that has been occurring since late April.
The time and impact of major social and sporting events continue to be the main factors in relation to out-of-home consumption.
Not surprisingly, restaurant groups continue to suffer, however, a fall of 4.8 percent annually will be especially painful if the continued increase in costs is added to that.
The warm and long summer couldn't have come at a worse time for the restoration businesses and the weather will be responsible for saying whether the moderation of the temperatures experienced during August will provide the much needed breath for the sector -
The total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent during July, which reflects the slowdown in brand launches.
The UK's Coffer Peach Tracker Industry sales indicator collects and analyzes data on the performance of 47 operating groups with a set benefit of over Â£9,000 million and is considered the sector's benchmark.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that hide their parents
One in five children (some only 11 years old) have secret social media accounts that hide their parents and teachers according to a survey
A survey carried out at 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the number of pages of \"False Insta\"
This news has led to an increase in fear of sexual content being published
Twenty percent of students claimed to have a \"principal\" account to show their parents
One in five children (some only 11 years old) are creating accounts on social media that keep adults secret.
A survey conducted to 20,000 high school students put out of display a growth in the number of accounts of -Insta fake - (in reference to social Instagram photo exchange network).
This news has led to an increase in fear of sexual content being published.
Twenty percent of the students claimed that they used a -main - softened account to show their parents while they had other private ones.
A mother who ran into her 13-year-old daughter's secret account found a teenager who asked for her to \"violate her.\"
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters â and Headmasters â Conference (HMC) of independent schools, detected that 40 percent of boys and girls aged 11-18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
The head of the HMC, Mike Buchanan, stated the following:-Awning result that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them-
Eilidh Doyle will be the \"Athletes' Voice\" on the Council of the Scottish athletic federation
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish federation council of athletics as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the board of directors.
Doyle is the most award-winning Scottish athlete and President Ian Beattie has defined this decision as an excellent opportunity for those who run the sport to benefit from their extensive international experience over the past decade.
\"Eilidh enjoys enormous respect within the Scottish community, the United Kingdom and worldwide, and we are sure that Scottish athletics will greatly benefit from its incorporation into the council,\" said Beattie.
Doyle stated as follows: \"I really want to make the athletes' spokesperson and hope I can contribute and help direct the sport in Scotland\"
The American, who won the 200 meters and 400 meters in the 1996 Atlanta Games between a total of four Olympic gold and who currently works as a regular commentator for the BBC, suffered a transient ischemic attack that prevented him from being able to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: \"There's been an apoplexy for a month.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said that only time could determine if I could recover and until that grade.
It was an exhausting job, but I managed to recover completely, I learned to walk again and currently do agility exercises.

An announcement of a mother's milk extractor in which compared to women with cows divides public opinion into networks
A parent milk extractor company has divided public opinion into networks with an advertisement in which it compares to the lactating mothers with cows that are being mushed to.
To announce the launch of the proclaimed â the world's first silent portable mother's milk extractor â the company Elvie published an ironic ad in the style of a music video to demonstrate the freedom offered by the new milk extractor to mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of ugly for the cows at the pace of a song with letters like the following: \"Yes, it moved me to myself, but I don't have glue\" and \"If you haven't noticed, they're not umbrates, they're my breasts--
The choir goes on: \"Muxe, mouse, I'm feeding the babies, muxe, muxe, muxe, I'm muffining my friends\"
Nevertheless, the announcement, which was published on the company's Facebook page, provoked controversy on networks.
With 77,000 reproductions and hundreds of comments, the video caused different reactions among the viewers, many of whom claimed that this is manifesting the \"horrors\" of the dairy sector.
-Using cows to advertise this product was a very mediocre decision.
Like us, they need to become pregnant and give birth to be able to produce milk, but in their case we steal their children days after giving birth - wrote one.
Elvie milk extractor can be discreetly placed inside a maternal bra (Elvie/nai)
Another viewer commented on the following:-Clariously traumatic for the mother and baby.
But yes, why aren't they used to announce a milk extractor for mothers who stay with their babies -
Another viewer added the following:-What ad with so little tact-
Other spectators defended the ad, even a woman claimed that the song seemed to - I am very funny -
- I think it's a great idea.
If I was still breast-feeding, I'd buy one.
Taking off my milk made me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad is a little bit screwed up, but I interpreted it as a joke.
I think it's a great product - he wrote one.
Another commented: -This is a fun announcement addressed to mothers who extract their milk (often in their workplaces or in baths) and feel like - cows -
This is not an advertisement for eloxiating or judging the dairy industry â
At the end of the video, this group of women reveals that they have been dancing with the discreet extractors inserted into their subjects.
The concept on which the campaign is based is that many women who extract their milk claim to feel like cows.
However, the Elvie milk extractor is completely silent, has no cables or tubes and can be discreetly fitted into a maternal bra, which gives women freedom to move, hold their babies and even go out there while they are extracting their milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and executive creative director of Mother commented on the following:-Elvie extractor is such a revolutionary product that deserves a daring and provocative launch.
In describing the parallelism existing between women and dairy cows, we wanted to put the focus on milk extraction and all the challenges it entails as we demonstrated in an entertaining and close way to the incredible sense of freedom that the new extractor will offer.
This is not the first time that the Elvie extractor occupies newspaper headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two creatures paraded on the gateway to designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly displaced to a camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained increased despite the fact that the monthly number of border crossings remained relatively unchanging, partly due to the rigorous rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration made it difficult to assign godfathers to children.
Traditionally, most godfathers were also undocumented immigrants and were afraid to endanger their ability to stay in the country by taking a step forward to claim a child.
This risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that possible godfathers and other adult members of their homes would have to send their fingerprints and that such data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high office of the United States Customs Immigration and Control Service, testified before Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who requested to apardirage minors without company.
Subsequently, the agency confirmed that 70% of the arrested had no criminal record.
âPretty of 80% of people who are godfathers or who are part of the home of these are found in the country illegally, and a large part of these are foreigners who have committed crimes.
That is why we will continue to pursue those individuals - said Mr. Albence.
In order to process children more quickly, officials have introduced new standards that will require one of these to appear in court before it transpires one month from their detention in place of 60 days, which was the previous norm, according to the shelter workers.
Many will appear through videoconferencing rather than in person to try to legalize their case against an immigration judge.
Those who do not meet the requirements for assistance will quickly be deported.
The longer they remain in custody, the more likely there will be to become anxious or depressed, which may lead to violent raptures or escape attempts by shelter workers and system reports published over the past months.
Lawyers have stated that such fears increase in larger centers such as Tornillo's, in which there is more chance that the symptoms of a child is experiencing it are misperceived because of its size.
They also added that moving children to the camping area without giving them enough time to prepare them from an emotional point of view or to say goodbye to friends could assume a trauma that many continue to suffer.
Syria requests the occupying forces of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, addressing the UN General Assembly, also asked Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the war in the country is currently in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also holds the post of Deputy Prime Minister, stated that foreign forces were found in Syrian soil illegally, with the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they would - take care of them in the timely manner -
-You must withdraw immediately and without conditions - you have communicated to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the - war against terrorism has almost ended - in Syria, where more than 36,000 people have died since the year 2011 and millions of them had to flee their homes.
He also stated that Damascus would continue - fighting this sacred battle until we clean up all Syrian territories - from terrorist groups and - from all illegal foreign presence -
United States has approximately 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly to train and advise Kurdish forces and Arab Syrians who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in this war-torn country.
On the subject of the refugees, Moualem stated that the proper conditions were given for their return and blamed the -some Western countries - of the - diffusion of irrational fears - that caused the refugees not to return.
\"We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,\" he said.
\"They're politicizing what should be a mere humanitarian matter.\"
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not offer aid for reconstruction for Syria until a political agreement has taken place between Assad and the opposition to put an end to the war.
UN diplomats claim that the recent agreement reached between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral zone in Idlib's last large rebel bastion allowed the political conversations to continue.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey avoided a large-scale assault by Syrian troops supported by Russia in the province, in which three million people live.
However, Moualem pointed out that the agreement had - clear deadlines - and expressed his hope that the military actions would have as destination the jihadists, including the soldiers from the Al-Nusra front bound to Al-Qaeda, which - will be eradicated -
The UN envoy Staffan of Mixture hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition to elaborate a draft of a post-war constitution for Syria and to facilitate the holding of elections.
Moualem set out the conditions to ensure the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that the work of the body should be restricted to -review the articles of the current constitution - and alerted against possible interference.
Why Trump's gonna win a second term
Following that logic, Mr Trump would achieve re-election by 2020 unless, as many liberals will be waiting, impeachment and scandals put an end to his presidency prematurely.
In what it would certainly be â the most dramatic end of a presidency â
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue among observers.
From the year 2014, the prime-time audience indexes multiplied by more than two, until reaching the 1.05 million viewers in the CNN and nearly tripled until reaching 1.6 million in the MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime-time hours, an increase of 1.7 million regarding four years ago according to Nielsen, and the program (The Rachel Maddow Show) from MSNBC led the indexes of cable channel hearing with 3.5 million viewers during the nights where important news was produced.
\"It's like a fire that attracts people because it's about something we don't understand,\" said Neal Baer, showrunner of the drama to the ABC (Designed Survivor) who is a secretary of the ministerial cabinet who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of âJust the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys â Club, - has another theory.
Remember a taxi trip in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Mr Trump.
Why? she asked him.
\"He said, \"Because it makes me laugh,\" Mrs. Scovell told me.
There's entertainment inside the chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else that appears on television, the plots that run from Washington can determine the future of the Roe case against Wade, if emigrant families can reunite and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting from reality is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Still, it assumes something that goes beyond being an informed citizen to spend six hours watching an expert panel debate about the use by Bob Woodward of sources - anonymous - for his book -Fear - Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich fur bomber jacket - a garment filled with arrogance - said the Washington Pos) and the implications of Stormy Daniels' s clumsy descriptions of Mr Trump's anatomy.
I won't look at Super Mario again in the same way.
\"Part of what makes it seem like a reality show is that it's giving you something new every night\" said Brent Montgomery, high executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of \"Pawn Stars\" -- a space that deals with the changes in the characters and the daily argumental spins of Trump's show (the conflict with N.F.L., the eloxies to Kim Jong-un...).
You can't afford to miss an episode or stay behind.
When I got in touch with Mr. Fleiss this week, he made sun and a temperature of 26 degrees out of the house, on the north coast of Kauai, but was locked in the house watching MSNBC while recording the CNN.
He was unable to disengage while Brett Kavanaugh was about to face the Senate Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging on a thread.
\"I remember when we were making all those crazy programs at that time and people said, \"This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,\" said Mr. Fleiss.
\"I thought it was a joke spice, but it turns out they were right\"

External money reaches a lot to finance applications to the House for the elections of half the legislature
Not surprisingly, the 17th Congressional District of Pennsylvania is receiving a large flow of money due to the reorganization of a Congressional District with two representatives in career functions to occupy the same post.
This district located in the outskirts of Pittsburgh which was recently reorganized is represented by the Democratic candidate, Conor Lamb, who succeeded his post in another district in a special election held last spring.
Lamb is presented against another representative in functions, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th Pennsylvania district, which is largely overridden over the new 17th district.
The maps were reorganized after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court determined in January that Republicans had manipulated the electoral constituency of the ancient districts in their favor.
The electoral career in the new 17th Congressional District unleashed a campaign funding festival between the parties' main financial arms, the Congressional Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after he achieved an adjusted victory in the March special election for the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania, which enjoyed a broad follow-up.
That post was occupied by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won in the district for 20 points.
Political experts grant Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States valued the possibility of penalizing The Savior for his support to China and then pulled back
The diplomats warned that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a pleasant meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017 and even owned a hotel in Panama until his partners threw in the Trump Organization steering team.
State Department officials decided to order the heads of the U.S. diplomatic missions of O Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama â for recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan â as said by Heather Nauert, the spokesman for the department in a statement made this very month.
However, only the possibility of applying sanctions against O Salvador was challenged, which received approximately $140 million of US aid during 2017, including to control drug trafficking, development and economic aid.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts in financial aid and restrictions on visas, would prove very negative for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, US and Central American officials postponed the holding of a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year, which was considered a step forward in efforts to prevent emigration of people towards the United States.
But in mid-September, important administrative officials made it clear that they wished the conference to advance, effectively ending any possibilities for the application of sanctions for The Savior.
It is scheduled that Vice President Mike Pence lead the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, in a symptom of the importance the administration gives him, diplomats stated.
The three North American envoys discreetly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new or harsh message or punishment coming from Washington.
A spokesperson for Mr Bolton's White House declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to talk about the internal deliberations always and when the anonymity of the participants was maintained.
His accounts were corroborated by an external analyst close to the administration and who also agreed to speak whenever his anonymity was retained.
Study History
The next negative case could be the special advisor Robert Mueller's report on the case of possible obstruction of Mr Trump's justice, of which there is currently abundant evidence in the public archive.
According to the record, Mr. Mueller is also conducting his investigation to find out whether Mr. Trump's campaign conspired with Russia in his attack on our election.
If Congress changes hands, Mr Trump will have to render accounts in that organism, just when he has to prepare for elections, and he may finally have to face a popular jury.
They are many incognites and I don't want to suggest that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable, just like that of his European counterparts.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the battle.
In 1938, German officials were determined to give a coup against Hitler if the western front resisted and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of killings that subsequently occurred.
The course of history revolves around those points of inflection, and the inexorable advance of democracy is accelerating or backward.
Americans face several of those inflection points at this time.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump dismisses the Deputy Attorney General of the State, Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein carried with the water to his neck since this paper reported that last year he suggested secretly recording the president and speculated that he was incapacitated for the position.
Mr. Rosenstein stated that The Times' information is not true.
How are we going to answer whether the inquiry that has just been requested by the F.B.I. on Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or not impartial or whether his appointment to the Supreme Court is confirmed despite the credible accusations of sexual abuse and false witness?
And, above all, will we vote in the half-legislation elections for a Congress demanding Mr Trump's responsibilities?
If we do not pass those tests, democracy will be subjected to a long winter.
But I think we won't fail, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime who also occupied my house, which was known to the embassy.
He survived, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to arrest Shabbat's candida on that table which included a swastika.
With that inheritance, how will I not be optimistic towards the future -

Rangers Graham Dorrans player shows himself optimistic towards the meeting against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers receives the Rapid Vienna on Thursday knowing that a victory against the Austrians, after the impressive draw achieved in Spain in front of the Villarreal this same month, would place them in a very favorable position to rank themselves in Group G of Europe League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from debuting this season until the 2-2 draw against the Villarreal, but believes Rangers can use that result as a trampoline to achieve more important things.
-It was a good point for us, as the Villarreal is a good team - declared the 31-year-old player.
We entered the party believing that we could achieve something positive and we reached a point.
We had the opportunity to win at the end, but in general, the tie is probably a fair result.
They were probably better during the first half, but in the second we were superior.
Next Thursday will be another great European night.
We hope we can achieve the three points, but it will be difficult, because they have achieved a good result in their last match, but with the support of our audience, I am sure we can fight to achieve a positive outcome.
Last year was hard between everything that happened to my injuries and the changes produced on the team, but there is an excellent environment at this time.
The team is good, the boys are having a good time and the trainings are good.
We hope to be able to fight, forget the past season and be successful â
Women worry about their retirement savings
Despite the fact that the participants in the survey were clear as they wanted them to take care of them, few people spoke to their family about the matter.
About half of the participants in this study conducted by Nationwide stated that they commented with their couples on the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% claimed they had spoken to their children about the subject.
\"People want you to take care of a family member, but they're not taking the necessary steps to have that conversation,\" said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationwide Life Insurance Department.
You can start with the following.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare your family to care for you if you don't communicate your desires to them much in advance.
Collaborate with your counselor and family to agree where and how to receive the care, as such decisions can be a determining factor in determining the cost.
Call your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay those expenses.
Among the extended care funding options are found a traditional prolonged care insurance policy, a cash-value hybrid life insurance policy to help cover these expenses or self-insurance covered with your own funds, whenever you have the money.
Negotiate your legal documents: Avoid legal battles.
Get a health care representative to designate a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals fulfill your wishes in case you are unable to communicate with you.
It also values the ability to sign a notary power to manage your finances.
You will need to select a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and make sure your bills are paid if you are incapacitated.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that your parent or older mother has a medical emergency and goes on his way to the hospital.
Would you be in a position to answer questions about their medications and allergies?
Write down that information in detail in a written plan to be prepared.
\"Not only is the financial issue at stake, but who are the doctors who are responding to it,\" Martin asked.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
A powerful earthquake and tsunami that affected the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to official sources, resulted in the death of at least 384 people, a figure that is expected to continue to increase.
Due to the cutting of communications, rescue bodies could not obtain any information from Donggala's regency, an area located north of Palu that is closest to the 7.5 degree magnitude earthquake epicenter.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
We then provided you with some key data on Palu and Donggala, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Celebes, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Celebes, with an approximate population of 379,800 people in the year 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency that is found along over 300 km of coast northwest of the island of Celebes.
This regency, an administrative region less than one province, counted with an approximate population of 299,200 inhabitants in the year 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main pillars of the Central Celebes province's economy, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but are mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also affected the western part of Donggala in 1996, causing the death of nine people.
Indonesia is found over the Pacific Fire Belt of high seismic activity, so it suffers earthquakes regularly.
These are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have suffered over the past few years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of the Province of Aceh of Indonesia, in northern Sumatra, which occurred on December 26, provoked a tsunami that affected 14 countries, causing the death of 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half, in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes affected the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, in front of the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6.8 degrees of magnitude struck southern Java, the most populated island of Indonesia, causing a tsunami that devastated the southern coast, causing the death of nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 degrees of magnitude occurred near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake of 7.5 degrees of magnitude affected the Mentawai Islands, located opposite Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of people and resulted in the death of approximately 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake affected Pidie Jaya's regency, located in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, as people remembered the devastation caused by the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
On this occasion no tsunami occurred, but more than 100 people died due to the fall of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes were produced on the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, which resulted in the death of more than 500 people, most of them on the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily taken away.
Arrest Sarah Palin's eldest son for accusations of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for vice president Sarah Palin, was arrested accused of assault.
Palin, 29, natural of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested suspected of a domestic violence offence, of preventing the filing of a complaint for domestic violence and for resistance to authority, according to a note published by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took his phone off.
Palin remains in pre-trial detention at Mat-Su Pretrial Facility dependencies with a $500 bond, as reported by KTUU.
He presented himself before the judge on Saturday, in which he declared himself - not guilty, of course - when he was asked, he reported the chain.
Palin faces three minor offences of type A, which means he could enter jail until one year and receive a fine of $250,000.
He was also charged with a minor type B offence, punishable by a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges against Palin are presented.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently found in the Alaska War Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic assault, of preventing the filing of a complaint for domestic violence and possession of weapons in an drunk state in connection with the incident.
His fiancÃ©e accused him of poking a fist on his face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after linking her son's violent behavior with the post-traumatic stress disorder syndrome she suffers after serving with the army in Iraq.
An earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia causes hundreds of deaths
They are counted at least 384 dead after the earthquake that affected the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The 7.5 degree earthquake of magnitude caused a tsunami destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not available, and the death balance is expected to increase with the passage of days.
The earthquake occurred just opposite Central Celebes, in the northeast of the Indonesian capital, Iacarta.
They circulate videos through the social networks in which the moment of impact is shown.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a festival on the beach in the town of Palu when the tsunami struck the coast.
Federal taxes seek to apply a few times applied death penalty to the suspect of a terrorist attack in New York City
New York Federal Taxers are attempting to apply the death penalty to Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the New York terrorist attack that resulted in the death of eight people, a penalty that has not been applied in the state since the year 1953.
Saipov, aged 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike lane on the West Side Highway Avenue of Lower Manhattan, drying up the lives of the pawns and cyclists he found on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the taxes will have to show that Saipov has deliberately killed the eight victims and that it has caused them serious injury - intentionally - according to the notice of the intent of the death penalty application presented in the South District of New York.
Both offences involve the possibility of applying the death penalty in accordance with the court document.
Weeks after the attack took place, a federal jury presented to Saipov a charge of 22 crimes, including eight crimes of murder in collaboration with an organized crime group, a practice commonly used by the prosecutors of organized crime cases, and a crime of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required a -notable planning and premeditation - declared the taxes in describing the way Saipov carried out the -atroz, cruel and depraved - bombing.
âSayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pannucco â as indicated in the notice of intent of prosecution.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It's been a decade since the South District of New York doesn't process a death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug traffickers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a federal New York case was in 1953, in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a marriage that was executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage to the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed lack of repentance during the days and months following the attack according to the court documents.
He told the researchers that he felt good about what he had done, as the police said.
Saipov stated to the authorities that in order to carry out the attack, he was inspired by the ISIS videos he visualized on his phone according to the charge.
He also asked to be able to see the ISIS flag in his hospital room, the police stated.
He declared himself not guilty of the charge of 22 crimes.
David Patton, one of the federal office lawyers charged with representing Saipov, indicated that they were (obviously disappointed) with the decision of the prosecution.
We believe that the decision to apply for the death penalty instead of accepting a life sentence conviction without a possibility of revocation will only prolong the trauma caused by these events for all the people involved - Patton commented.
Saipov's defence team had previously asked the taxes not to apply for the death penalty.
A tory parliamentarian states that NIGEL FARAGE should be put at the forefront of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised - to immobilize a - force of people - today during a protest at the tory conference.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party claimed that politicians had to -feel pressure - from Eurosceptics (when one of Theresa May's own parliamentarians suggested that he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
The ordinary Member Peter Bone said before Birmingham's demonstration that the United Kingdom would have \"come out already\" from the EU if Mr Farage were Brexit's secretary.
But the challenge faced by Mrs May to reconcile the divided ranks of her party remained in evidence by joining the Tories in favour of staying in the EU to an independent protest against the Brexit held in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to maintain the commitments of his Chequers plan between the attacks of Brexit supporters, the opposites and the EU.
His allies insisted that he continued to fight to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the negative response, to force the Eurosceptics and laborers to choose between their plan and chaos.
Mr. Bone stated in the concentration of the Leave Means of Solihull movement that he wanted to end the Chequers plan.
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been told to take responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
\"If I had given it in office, we would have been outside the EU at this time,\" he said.
The Parliament member of Wellingborough added the following: âI will continue to defend Brexit, but we must abort the Chequers planâ.
Showing his opposition to the EU, he stated the following: \"We do not fight world wars to be served.
We want to make our own laws in our own country\".
Mr. Bone denied the suggestions that indicated that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: âThe idea that the British people have changed their mind and want to stay in the EU is completely falseâ.
The member of the Tories and Supporter of Brexit Andrea Jenkyns also went to the march, since which he made out to the reporters: \"The only thing I say is: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
\"The Chequers plan does not enjoy popularity between public opinion, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular between our party and our activists who, to begin with, are the ones who occupy the streets and allow us to be elected.
Cancel the Chequers plan and start listening\".
In a message addressed to Mrs May, he added: \"The prime ministers retain their jobs when they keep their promises.\"
Mr Farage stated in the concentration that it is necessary to make politicians \"feel uncomfortable\" if they intend to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
\"This is currently a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,\" he said.
\"They're trying to betray Brexit's decision and here we're meeting today to tell them that we won't let them hang out with his.\"
In a message addressed to an enthusiastic crowd, he added: \"I want you to make our political class, who is about to betray Brexit's decision, feel uncomfortable.
\"We are mobilizing the army of people in this country who gave us victory in Brexit and who will not rest until we become a proud, independent and autonomous United Kingdom\".
Meanwhile, supporters of staying in the EU made a march through Birmingham before holding a two-hour concentration in the city center.
A few activists waved banners with the Tories Against Brexit (Tories against Brexit) message after the group's launch this weekend.
Labourist Lord Adonis mocked the conservatives for the security issues they suffered in an application of the party at the beginning of the conference.
âThis is the people who tell us that they can have IT systems in order and all the best technology for Canada, to have a border without friction, to enjoy free market without borders in Ireland,â he added.
\"It's an absolute farce.
The concept of good Brexit does not exist,\" he added.
Warren plans to seriously think about presenting himself for the presidency
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren stated that he will seriously consider his candidacy to the presidency after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future on Saturday during a municipal session in a town in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will present himself to the re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of Trump's campaign in 2016 in Massachusetts.
It has been focused on speculations that place it as Trump's successor in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with its constituents using the format of the municipality since Trump took over the presidency.
An assistant asked if she was planning to introduce herself to the president.
Warren replied that it is time that \"women go to Washington to fix our government's problems, and that requires a woman in the presidency position\".
A detention related to Sims' deadly shooting was carried out, the LSU player
Baton Rouge Police, The Angeles, announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested for the murder of Wayde Sims, the LSU basketball player on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson in a press conference held at 11:00 (east time).
They had posted a shooting video on Friday requesting help identifying a man who was going out on the pictures.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot near Southern University campus on Friday.
\"Wayde Sims suffered a bullet wound in the head and eventually died as a consequence of this,\" Police Chief Murphy J. Paul informed the media on Saturday through 247sports.
Wayde stood up to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being present on the scene with a gun and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and placed in custody in the East Baton Rouge Parish police department.
Sims, a 2 meter youth who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 matches with 10 headlines last season and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per match.
Russia's Grand Prize: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title thanks to team orders, which allowed him to achieve victory above Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the time Valtteri Bottas was classified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team orders would prove decisive in the race.
Bottas, who left from the pole, had a good exit and almost left Hamilton only while defending his position during the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into boxes first and let Hamilton run with traffic in the back of the group, something that would prove decisive.
The Mercedes stopped in boxes one turn later and left behind Vettel, but Hamilton advanced it after several wheeled maneuvers that resulted in Ferrari's driver being reluctantly left indoors at risk of being delayed after a double defensive maneuver on the third bend.
Max Verstappen left from the last row of the exit grid and climbed up to the seventh square at the end of the first round on the day of his 21st birthday.
He then led the race during a large part of this thanks to which he retained his tires in order to get to go faster in the final part and advance Kimi Raikkonen by the fourth position.
He eventually got into boxes on turn 44 but couldn't advance any position on the last eight laps, which ended with Raikkonen on the fourth square.
It was a difficult day, because Valtteri did excellent work throughout the weekend and was a true knight.
The team did an extraordinary job to get the first two squares,\" Hamilton said.
An inappropriate body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein in an act celebrated on Saturday by his insistence on stating that he had not leaked Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which he accused Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, of sexual abuse.
In a speech made in an act in West Virginia, the president did not directly speak of the testimony given by Ford against the Senate's Judicial Committee and commented in his place that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were \"miserable, repulsive and liar\".
âThe only thing that could happen and the most beautiful that is happening in the Senate last days, when indignation is seen, when it is seen that people who are angry and who are miserable, disgusting and lying,â he said.
\"When you see these publications and leaks and they state: Åoh, I didn't go.
I didn't do it.
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you made any leaks?
Remember your answer... did you filter the document? :oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't.
Wait a minute.
Can we filter it?...No.\", he added imitating the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter in which charges against Kavanaugh were detailed made by Ford in July and filtered in early September, but Feinstein denied that the filtration came from his office.
\"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't filter his story,\" Feinstein commented to the committee as reported in The Hill newspaper.
âPediume kept her confidentiality and I did what she asked me to do.'
But his denial did not seem to sit well with the president, who commented the following during the act of Saturday night: \"I tell you that body language was not the right one.
He may not have filtered it, but he used the worst body language I've ever seen in my life\".
Continuing with his defence of the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was accused of inappropriate sexual conduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the charges for their own ends.
âThey are determined to regain power through any necessary means.
They are evil and disgusting, they don't care who Danan, who they have to run down to regain power and control,\" said the president according to Mediaite.

Dundee Stars noticed the defeat suffered on Friday at the Elite League against the Belfast Giants winning the match back for 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants achieved an early advantage through two goals Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie paired for the local set before Dwyer reestablished the Giants advantage.
Francois Bouchard tied for the Dundee before two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen allowed them to win the victory.
It was the third defeat in the Elite League of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who managed to go back to win the Dundee for 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was about the fourth season encounter between the two teams, with a balance of the three victories prior to the Giants' prol.

An air traffic controller dies to make sure that hundreds of passengers of an aircraft can escape an earthquake
An Indonesian air controller considered hero after death to ensure that an aircraft loaded with hundreds of passengers could safely take off.
The dead people balance is 800 and there are many missing after a large earthquake shook the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong replicas continue to feel in the area and are many people who are trapped under the waterfalls of the city of Palu.
Although his fellow workers fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the control tower at the airport Mutiara Sis Al Jufri of Palu which was violently swinging.
It remained in its post to ensure that Batik Air's 6321 flight, which was on the exit runway at that time, could safely take off.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought he was going to break down.
He died later in the hospital.
The spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirit, stated that it is possible that this decision would allow hundreds of lives to be saved, reported the ABC News channel in Australia.
We have prepared a Balikpapan helicopter in Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
\"Our hearts are filled when we hear,\" he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death balance may be thousands and the country's disaster management agency has claimed that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi, and Boutong is limited.
âThe victim balance is believed to continue to increase due to the fact that there are many bodies under the falls and many of them could not be reached,â said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency's spokesman.
Waves up to six meters devastated Palu, where a massive burial will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial planes are transporting help and food.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said the following to Sky News: \"Every minute an ambulance is bringing bodies.
Drinking water is scarce.
People are looting the minimarkets\".
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, declared to the CNN:-The Red Cross Indonesia is fighting to help survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could become much worse â
Indonesia's president, Joko Widodo, arrived at Palu on Sunday and communicated to the country's military:-I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the evacuation-related tasks.
You are ready - He informed CNN.
Indonesia previously suffered this year earthquakes in Lombok in which over 550 people died.
Aircraft Accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now states that there is one missing after an airplane crash in a pond
The airline operating a flight that crashed into a Pacific pond in Micronesia now states that there is one missing after stating previously that the 47 passengers and crew had left without incident the aircraft that was sinking.
Air Niugini stated in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they were unable to locate a passenger.
The airline reported that it was working jointly with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to try to locate this man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as their age or nationality.
Zone boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane's crash against the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Authorities stated on Friday that seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers continued in the hospital on Saturday and that all found themselves stable.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events continue to be unclear.
Both the airline and the United States Navy confirmed that the plane landed in the pond before reaching the landing runway.
Some witnesses claim that the plane has passed off the landing track.
Bill Jaynes, an American national passenger, commented that he entered very little time.
\"That's something extremely positive,\" Jaynes remarked.
Jaynes said that both he and other passengers managed to advance between the water reaching their waist to the emergency exits of the plane that was sinking.
He also remembered that flight attendants were screaming and frightened, and that he suffered a slight head wound.
The United States Navy indicated that some sailors who were working near the place on the improvement tasks of a dock also helped in the rescue using an inflatable boat to move people to the coast before the plane sank approximately 30 metres.
According to Aviation Safety Network data, 111 people have died in airline accidents registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none have affected Air Niugini.
An analyst composes the chronology of the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution referred to evidence on Saturday in the repeat of a man's trial accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
United States Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
During the trial he described for the jury how he used the records of a cell phone to recompose the 29-year-old defendant's movements, Quinton Tellis, and the 19, Jessica Chambers' victim, on the night of his death.
Rowlett stated that he received data from the location of several mobile phones demonstrating that Tellis met Chambers on the night of his death contradicting his earlier claims as reported by The Clarion Ledger newspaper.
When this data showed that his mobile phone met Chambers for the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went up to the stage on Saturday and testified that that day was not found in the city that day.
When the prosecution asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he stated that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was -- lying, because my truck was in Nashville --
Another contradiction consisted of Tellis stating that he had known Chambers since about two weeks when he died.
Cell phone records indicated that they had only been known since a week ago.
Rowlett stated that a while after Chambers' death, Tellis removed the messages, calls, and Chambers contact information from his phone.
\"I've deleted it from her life,\" Hale said.
It is scheduled that the defense begin its final allegations on Sunday.
The judge stated that he hoped that the trial would be seen for judgment by the jury that same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A threesome hip hop wants to challenge the negative perception the genre has by filling its music with positive messages.
The High Breed, a Bristol group, states that hip hop has drifted away from its origins with political and fighting messages against social problems.
They want to go back to their roots and get the combative hip hop back to being popular.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently experienced a rejuvenation in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?
A New York child nurse demands a couple after a âracist' message.
A New York child nurse will sue a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a message she would not address to her coming from the mother in which she complained that she was - another black -
The couple denies being racist and compares the demand with a \"extortion\"
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, showed her distress at finding that child nurse Giselle Maurice was black when her first day of work was presented in 2016.
- NOOOOOOOOOOOON, OTHER NEGRA - wrote Mrs Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a message.
However, rather than sending her to her husband, she sent her to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After realizing his mistake, a â uncomfortable â Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs Maurice, stating that the caregiver who had just left, who was African American, had done his job badly and that he was expecting a Filipino according to the New York Post announcement.
Mrs. Maurice was paid the day's work and sent home to an Uber.
Now Maurice is going to sue the couple to obtain compensation for dismissal and demands a compensation of $350 a day for the six months of internal work for those who had initially been hired even if there was no contract by means.
\"Look, I want to show you that those things aren't done,\" he said to the Post on Friday, to add later, \"It's a case of discrimination.\"
The couple responded to accusations of racism by stating that dismissing Maurice was the most reasonable, as they were afraid that they could not trust her after offending her.
My wife sent him a message that I had no intention of sending to him.
He's not a racist.
We are not racists - stated husband Joel Plasco to the Post.
-But would they leave their children in the hands of a person they offended, even if it had been due to a mistake?
Your baby just born?
Come on.
After comparing the demand with a -extortion - Plasco stated that his wife had just had a baby two months ago and that she was found in a - very difficult situation -
- They're going for a person like that?
That's not very ethical - he added the investment banker.
While the legal process continues, the court of public opinion quickly denounced the couple on social media, attacking them for their behavior and for the applied logic.
Paddington editors feared that readers had not identified themselves with a talking bear as it can be concluded in a new letter
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented on the following about the letter:-It is difficult to put herself in the skin of a person who reads it for the first time before it was published.
It is very fun to know now what we know about Paddington's enormous success -
After stating that his father, who had worked as a camera for the BBC before inspired himself to write the children's book on a small toy bear, would be optimistic in the face of the possibility that his work would be refused, he added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was - agridious - after his death last year.
From Paddington, to which he describes as a - very important member of our family - he added that his father was discreetly proud of the success he finally achieved.
âHe was a quiet man and nothing presumptuous,â he said.
âBut because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if you had a son who gets something: you're proud even if you didn't really do it.
I think he felt the success of Paddington a little that way.
Although it was a creation of his own and product of his imagination, he always gave all the credit to Paddington himself â
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye through the phone.
After the landing, his daughter was quickly taken to Nice's Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, where doctors worked unsuccessfully to save her life.
-Nad regularly called to say that he was very bad, that he was not expected to survive.
Then I got Nad's call to tell me he was going to die in the next two minutes and had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, \"Tashi, I love you very much, my love.
I'll meet you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications doctors had given him to keep his heart beating were slowly consuming and abandoning his body.
He had already died a while before and was now closing in.
I just had to sit down and wait, knowing it was happening.
He couldn't scream or cry because he was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I had to hold on.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Lapere, at that moment of struggle for her daughter's loss, entered the plane along with the other passengers, without notice of the baldness she was suffering.
\"No one detected it,\" he said.
I had my head down and tears were falling at all times.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight when I felt this impressive sense of solidarity with Nad.
That I needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved her.
Posts of afflicted women to avoid suicides on a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones due to suicide are working to prevent others from doing the same thing.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been placing cards on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and telephone numbers that can be called to ask for help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and killed himself at 18.
\"I don't want any father to feel like I have to feel me every day,\" he said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, commented that her son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
- Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said their smile lit up any room--
However, he left his job before he died and was -in a very deep depression -
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, was what he found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis commented, \"I have the continuing concern that a collateral effect will occur\"
Mrs. Davis created the cards - to inform people that there are people you can come to and talk to, even if you're a friend.
Don't be quiet. You need to talk.
Mrs Humphreys, who has been a friend of Mrs Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after her mother's death.
\"He didn't tell me he was sad or depressed or anything,\" he remarked.
A couple of days before Christmas, we detected a change in their attitude.
Christmas Day touched bottom (when the children opened their gifts, made no visual contact with them or nothing) â
He claimed that his death meant a tremendous trauma to them, but they must overcome him, \"Destroyed the family.
They're getting rid of us.
But we have to keep going and fight --

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs on a thread as the FBI initiates the investigation
\"I thought if we could get something like what I was asking for (an investigation for a limited time and limited scope), it is possible that we could get a little unity,\" said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would be -tossing out - due to the paralysing of supporters.
Why did they want Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican sympathizers to carry out the investigation?
Their reticence is due to a question of deadlines.
There are five weeks left for the mid-legislation elections (November 6). If, as expected, Republicans get bad results, they will be severely weakened in their attempts to get the man they wish to be elected to the country's highest court.
George W. Bush has been calling Senators, exerting pressure to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush, thanks to which he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen when the FBI carries out its report?
A vote will take place in the Senate, which currently occupy 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can reach at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break the tie and confirm it for the Supreme Court.
The number of deserters in North Korea drops under Kim's mandate
The number of deserters from North Korea to South Korea has been reduced since Kim Jong One's access to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean legislator stated.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea's unification ministry, stated that 1,127 desertions had occurred during the past year, away from 2,706 of the year 2011.
Mr. Park stated that the hardening of border controls between North Korea and China and the increase in tariffs charged by people in charge of passing people across the border were key factors.
Pyongyang did not make any public comments.
The vast majority of Northern deserters are finally offered citizenship of South Korea.
Seoul declares that over 30,000 North Koreans illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the largest border section with North Korea and which is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone existing between the two Koreas.
China views deserters as illegal emigrants rather than refugees and frequently repatriate them mandatory.
Relations between the north and south (which technically continue at war) have improved markedly over the past few months.
This same month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to keep conversations focused on negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons that were parked.
This occurred after the historic June meeting between the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-un held in Singapore, in which they agreed to work hard to eliminate nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the sanctions imposed by the United States for the lack of progress since then.
âIf we do not have confidence in the United States, we will not be able to rely on our national security and, under those circumstances, there is no possibility of any possibility that we disarmament unilaterally first - said Mr. Ri in a speech delivered in front of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh - hysterical - and states that it is not appropriate to access the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the House, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh (hysterical) and assured that it was not appropriate by its nature to access the Supreme Court.
Pelosi conducted these comments in an interview held on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
\"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman ever behaved that way, they would call her hysterical,\" Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's statement against the Senate's Judicial Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations of sexual abuse about Dr. Christine Blasey Ford as a teenager.
During the initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, on occasion almost screaming and staying if he spoke while describing his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the committee's Democrats, catalysing the charges against him as a -assinate of grotesque and coordinated reputation - organized by liberals angry at Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelosi stated that he believed that Kavanaugh's statement showed that he could not access the Supreme Court because he demonstrated that he had prejudices against the Democrats.
\"I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats,\" he said.
Pelosi objected when asked whether he would try to challenge Kavanaugh if it is confirmed at the post and if the Democrats get the majority in the House of Representatives.
âWhat I have to say is as follows: if you are not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then it is not appropriate to be not only in the Supreme Court, but in the court in which you are currently in - Pelosi commented.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Washington D.C. Appeals Circuit Court.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about possible resolutions that Kavanaugh may adopt against the law of patient protection and accessible health care or the Roe case against Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In the confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh dismissed questions about whether certain Supreme Court decisions would be annulled.
\"It's not the time for a hysterical and prejudiced person to access the court and still above expect us to say, look what's good,\" Pelosi said.
And women need to exercise it.
It's a justifiable diatribe, months and years of rage overflowing, and it can't drive it out without crying.
\"We cry when we get angry,\" said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
\"I don't think it's that weird, no.\"
He continued by saying, \"I received a lot of help from a woman who was executive somewhere, who said she was also crying when she got angry, but who developed a technique that consisted in that, when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, \"You'd better think I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm angry.
And then he went on.
It looked brilliant.
The tears are allowed as an exhaust valve for anger in part because they are essentially not understood.
One of my sharpest memories in one of my early jobs in an office dominated by men, in which I began to cry with an impossible rage to describe, was that an older woman grabbed me from the back of my neck, a distant superior who had always provoked me a slight fear, and led me to the hollow of the ladder.
\"Never let them see you crying,\" he said.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll comfort you if they stick to you.
Patricia Schroeder, at that time a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught on an out-of-marriage adventure on a ship named Monkey Business and was removed from the presidential race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought there was no reason why she could not consider presenting herself to the presidency.
\"It wasn't a well-thought decision,\" I remarked among laughs 30 years later.
There were already seven candidates in the race and the last one they needed was another.
Someone named him \"Brancaneves and the seven dwarfs\"
Because the campaign was advanced, it was delayed in fundraising, so it swore it would not enter the race by the presidency unless it managed to raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
He found that some of those who supported him contributed $1,000 to male candidates would only provide $250.
\"What do you think, that I have a discount,\" he asked.
When he made his speech to announce that he would not present a formal campaign, he was overcome by emotions (of gratitude to the people who supported it, of frustration with the system that made it difficult to raise money and to address voters rather than the delegates and of anger for existing sexism) who remained speechless.
- You would think that you had suffered a nervous crisis - she reminded Mrs Schroeder of how the press reacted with her.
You'd think Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to write on my tombstone?

In what way can trade war between the United States and China for Beijing prove positive
The initial bombings of the trade war between the United States and China have been embarrassing and, despite the fact that the war is far from over, a distancing between countries may prove beneficial for Beijing in the long term, experts state.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, launched the first warning at the beginning of this year by recording Chinese key exports, including solar panels, steel, and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with the application of new tariffs affecting an equivalent of $20 billion, recording half of the items coming to the United States coming from China.
Beijing counterattacked at a time in the same way, the most recent rising fares from five to ten percent in 60,000 million dollars in American products.
China has promised to imitate US measures and it seems unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will be immuting in the short term.
In order to get Washington to fall behind, it would be necessary to give in to their demands, but publicly folding in front of the United States would prove much more embarrassing to Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Even so, experts claim that if Beijing knows how to play their cards correctly, the pressures of trade war with the United States could favor China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of both economies.
The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the necessary conditions to initiate an economic crisis in both countries is actually much more dangerous than previously recognized -- said Abigail Grace, an Asian-centred researcher at the Center for New American Security, a study center.
Syria is - listed - for refugees to return, states the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria states that it is ready for the refugees' voluntary return and is requesting help to rebuild the country devastated by a war of more than seven years.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Maualem stated that the country's conditions are improving.
- Today the situation on the ground is much more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism - he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
All the necessary conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they had to abandon due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and livelihoods are now given.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people continue to live in the country and need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem stated that the Syrian regime would appreciate the help it can receive to rebuild a country that is devastated.
But he pointed out that he would not accept conditional aid or from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe achieves victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup 2018 defeating the U.S. team by a final score from 16.5 to 10.5 at the Le Golf National club located outside Paris, France.
It is the sixth consecutive defeat of the United States in European territory and leads without winning a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe recovered the crown when Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who was the one most battled during the tournament, sent the ball to the water in hole 16 of pair 3, losing his match against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer shined in all its series, becoming one of the only four players who achieved a 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament was implemented in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5&4 by the worse ranking player of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen, of Denmark.
The first classified in the world's rinking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2&1 against Englishman Ian Poulter, which is possible to play his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran with eight played Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio GarcÃ­a became the European player with more tournament victories, with 25.5 points.
-I don't often cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a rough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for selecting me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy I can get the drink back.
The important thing is the team, and I'm glad I could have helped--declared an excited Garcia after European victory.
He passed the testimonial to his compatriot John Ram, who managed to defeat the American golf legend Tiger Woods by 2&1 in the individual Sunday party.
\"It's amazing how proud I feel today because I could have defeated Tiger Woods, I grew up watching that boy play,\" said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost his four matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 record on the Ryder Cup.
It is a strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, winning 14 majors, located just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had problems throughout the weekend not to get out of the streets, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who played a golf of a high caliber throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk stated after his team's frustrating performance: \"I'm proud of these boys, they fought.
This morning for a moment they put Europeans in difficulty.
We fought.
I take off my hat before Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
His 12 players played very well.
We'll reorganize, work with the PGA of America and with our Ryder Cup Committee and move on.
I want these 12 boys and I'm proud to be captain.
It's for taking off your hat.
