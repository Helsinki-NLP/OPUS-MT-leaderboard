White: Tower on a1, pawn on b6, king on c8. Black: pawns on a7 and b7, king on a8, bishop on b8. White put the opponent on zugzwang playing the tower on a6, after which black will only have two options: take the tower on a6 or play your bishop on any other house on the b8-h2 diagonal. In the first case, whites advance their pawn from b6 to b7 and give mate. In the second situation, the white rook takes the black pawn on a7 with identical result.
