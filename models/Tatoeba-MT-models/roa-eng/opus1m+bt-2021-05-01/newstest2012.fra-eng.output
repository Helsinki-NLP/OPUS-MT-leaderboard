Parliament has not ratified the amendment for the release of Tymosenko
The Ukrainian parliament refused, as part of an amendment to criminal law, the draft annulment of the paragraph relating to the indictment of Julia Tymosenko, the leader of the opposition.
In second reading, Members refused the draft amendment to reduce the penalties for economic crimes, which could have opened the doors of freedom for the current former Prime Minister.
Tymosenko was sentenced in October to 7 years in prison for having entered into a priori disadvantageous agreement with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not final and the court must decide on the appeal of the convicted person in December.
Tymosenko qualified the regime's decision of political vengeance and provoked a process of suspicion of bias from the court also to the west.
The draft annulment of paragraph 365 of criminal law, on the basis of which the former Prime Minister was sentenced, was signed by 147 deputies.
It would have taken 226 votes to approve it.
Libyan Victory
The Libyan liberation or rebellion has already won.
Muammar Kaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
The winners are still to be determined.
As is customary in the region, the winners of the elections are Islamists, but they are moderate or radical.
The Provisional National Council has decreed the usual law of the Shariah and we already know what this is about.
Libya becomes a crime-free country because for a robbery we cut off their hands.
Women can forget the emancipation, the non-respective ones of the faith are liable to capital punishment...
It is the Qur'an who will unite in place of the dictator's personality the society composed of opposing tribes.
In Libya there will be such an order as we cannot represent it and we certainly would not like it.
But our way of life is not unique, it is not objectively the best and would probably not be advantageous for Libyans.
It is particularly surprising that Islamist warriors have accepted help with gratitude from unfaithful dogs.
The only excuse is that it was not an American general who was leading the NATO strikes but rather Allah who celebrated the greatness of each attack.
So when it comes to looking for the winners in Libya, the West is not part of it.
We participated in the shootings, served Islam and our hairdressers turned away from the dictator as a political ally without it bringing any profit.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not deal with Libya militarily.
There is therefore no problem for the premises to get rid of \"crossed\"
Without land use, oil companies will easily have access to Libyan black gold.
Perhaps not so much, and the West will finally be able to boast of a disinterested protection of human rights.
As little as we can stop these followers of the Sharia.
A new era of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe are the target of investors.
A round of statistics was spent on Europe on Tuesday.
Each state has published GDP information for the 3A.
The Czech economy stagnated this last quarter, while France and Germany are growing.
The bond market beats every record.
Investors look not only at Italy, but also at Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the euro area, Germany, Czech Republic and other European countries published their visions of economic development for the third quarter earlier.
The GDP of Germany has an expected growth of 0.5%, that of France of 0.4%.
Both countries modified the data for the second quarter in which Germany was better than expected (i.e. 0.3% growth instead of 0.1% expected), however France reported a slight decrease of 0.1% (it was a question of stagnation origin).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter.
But GDP has stagnated, and according to the Czech Bureau of Statistics, it is confirmed that the trend is towards a gradual decline in economic growth.
The results are worse than the analysts' forecasts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% during the third quarter but stagnated during the last quarter.
In the third quarter, the German economy had a growth of 0.5% according to the planned data and periodically recalculated.
The euro area economy and the European Union grew by 0.2% between July and September compared to the previous quarter, corresponding to what analysts had planned.
The Greek economy fell by 5.2%.
Ten-year bond performance is 28.45%
The performances of the obligations of Spain and Italy are increasing to critical limits.
The problems begin to feel in Austria, France, Belgium, etc.
Czech bond yields remain below 4% while the situation worsens in the region.
Votes were heard in Germany to say that the ECB should be the guarantee of last instance .
Czechs qualified for EURO.
They won in Montenegro 1:0 and celebrate the qualification for 200 million
The football performance has succeeded in its most difficult mission of the season!
In Montenegro, she also won thanks to the super Cech and the guard Petr Jiracek 1:0.
Czech football has also successfully defended with a good share of luck in the second part of its qualification and will not miss Europe's championship.
IHNED.cz followed the qualification match with a detailed report.
No particular excitement during the first part and a great deal of luck for the second part.
Czech performance also won thanks to the Super Czech and Hero Petr Jiracek with 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates his qualification at the European Championship.
The Montenegrins were under pressure until the second part because of a specific Czech defence.
The game's victims were Damjanovic and Vucinic who missed two chances of scoring a goal.
And thanks to the super Petr Cech the Czech representation will not be absent at the European Championship next year, and in addition a reward of 200 million crowns in the Czech football box.
From the first few minutes we played a warrior football.
The two teams were hard to set up combinations and the game focused mainly around the central line.
The pressure of national footballers did not get to lose the Czech defence, which specifically responded to the long shots even during the first half-time.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear programme.
They created a human shield
A few hundred high school students have created a human shield around a nuclear site in Iran.
They want to support the nuclear programme of their country in this way in the face of a possible Israeli assault.
Students prayed at noon in front of the site and then desired the death of the EU and Israel.
A few hundred students from the universities of Ispahan created a human shield on Tuesday around the nuclear technology centre of Ispahan where uranium is transformed.
They thus openly expressed that they would defend their own lives' nuclina programme at the risk of their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) noted in its latest information that Iran has continued to strengthen its nuclear weaponry.
A possible attack by Iranian nuclear institutions is reported in Israel.
Students prayed at noon in front of the site and then desired the death of the EU and Israel.
In the case of an attack, whose aim would be to destroy the Iranian nuclear program, the targets would be not only Ispahan, but also the Natanz site where uranium is enriched.
The diet of an obese child: do not take breakfast and take food for dinner
Over one third of 9-13-year-olds have overweight problems, 9% of schoolchildren will weigh above the average and 5% are obese.
As current research shows, obese children come from families with a unhealthy lifestyle.
This again shows how important the environment in which human beings evolve and the models around them is.
On obese children's tables, for example, 50 per cent more often than in normal-weight children's families.
19% of the obese were fried at dinner according to the survey carried out with awareness - Obesity is not a chance -
In small families, sport is also not a habit, which is now the case for most schoolchildren today - only 15% answered that at least once a week parents found time for active movement.
Investigation of 900 children
The survey took place during the last school year and participated in 900 students in the primary schools in Czechia.
It was the second edition of \"Obesity is not a chance - action supported by the General Health Insurance and the Unilever Society.
From the beginning, more than 12,000 students from sixth to third enrolled in this project.
One of the determining factors that causes a dramatic increase in the number of overweight, even obese children, is the absence, correct diet and not enough physical exercise.
\"Only half of the children asked indicate, for example, eating 5 times a day breakfast-in case - lunch - try- dinner, which is a basic principle of a good diet,\" indicates one of the results of the survey.
No breakfast and breakfast charcuterie at dinner
The experts point to the fact that to have healthy development you need some basic details such as a family breakfast at the same time.
In Czechia, only 23% of students' families eat at the same time.
Most families each have their own breakfast.
And the worst thing that has been learned is that a tenth of the population does not have breakfast at all.
Breakfast, however, is the basis of a good daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that in obese children's families, unhealthy fries are used more often.
Almost every student - not to mention weight - drink daily of sweet drinks (70%).
More than 40% of the children questioned were regularly involved in sport, but for parents it was only 15%.
Prepare your diet
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to prepare their own food from the options proposed according to their own taste and personal opinion.
\"Czech children's preferences from 12 to 15 years of age are far from ideal in terms of healthy eating.\"
Among their favorite dishes are a lot of cakes, meats and sugars.
\"The most alarming is a great preference for sugar lemonades,\" is indicated in the results of the survey.
For lunch it is the pasta that took the first place right in front of white meat.
Children did not want to be fertile, and the preference for fish and vegetable meals was very low.
Head of Health
The survey also showed that children are ready to change their habits from the time they receive ad hoc information.
\"During a review of a group of survey participants who had completed the questionnaire after the awareness-raising session, Obesity is not a chance, a determined willingness to go to a healthy diet was seen,\" the survey results indicate.
The most significant was for example with regard to sweet lemonades as children began to give preference to drinking water.
The children most often checked on the questionnaire for white meat and fish as the main dish and would reduce sugary and knedliky dishes (Czech speciality of breadmeal or potatoes).
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, saying professionals
In a presentation article on how to learn for stylists, I became a little angry that there was a lot of it from the beginning.
I wasn't thinking about what was going to happen later.
The presentations of three specialist professionals, the clothing of the characters and a seminar on what happens on the spot.
And it'll be worse.
The closer we come to the final reviews and the more practical exercises and information are expected.
And even when there are courses on Saturdays and Sundays it's really \"hard\"
This time we have with Director Alenka (in the course there are no boys) treated how to dress the woman who does not have standard measurements.
And women of this kind are the majority.
One has a small neck, the other a boy's body, without a particular curve, another of the surweights.
The stylist must know how to optically soften wide arms, lengthen a neck or add needed curves.
We came to highlight the character beautifully and also not dress too conspicuously of women's types like Jennifer Lopez with a strong breast and hips pronounced and a fine size.
If, for example, there is a difference between the size and the hips so that the skirts or trousers do not pass at all, that is worth the shot to make it tailored.
And you will not regret it because the dress that falls impeccably is invaluable.
In a tailor-made skirt you will feel much better than in the one that slips permanently, wraps up and does not hold the belt and so on.
For those who have a male appearance can afford a Tucker-style dress, with pieces of sewing fabrics, or even embroidery.
There are, of course, many examples of different appearances and I am happy that I have all week to sort out all the information received.
But I'm also afraid that I have too much to do at home.
Each intern received a celebrity to dress for the day and the evening.
We must take into account the present appearance, the type of personality style and its appearance.
I'll have to dress -Miranda Kerr, whom you may know about the campaign the Secret of Victoria.
At the bottom of me, I am pleased because it is better than to dress Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera who has taken almost 100 kilos in recent times (don't take my statement, svp, completely seriously) or the young Selena Gomez.
We need to cut and sew from magazines or search the internet, print and work graphics.
The Moodboard, as said for the final result, expresses our personal style as well as our relationship with graphic creation.
Reflecting also on the graphic part of styling is also important.
The stylist not only wears physics but creates, for example, the production pages in magazines (on the products given the trends for handbags, coats, etc.).
Mario Kamenik, stylist and graphicist, has kept us from all this.
But that, until Sunday.
The stylist must have a general vision
Three guests of the specialty gave a diverse aspect to the Saturday session filled with information about the different types of characters.
Honza Pokorny, stylist, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renc.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to use it.
And a talented stylist knows how to work with a single dress differently.
Variability is for this prime example.
Like for example this trench-coat that must be worn in a classic way with a jeans and a t-shirt as a light coat but also it can also dress the naked body, with scarpins and take it as a picture as a dress.
Or just go up the sleeves or neck and have a new look immediately.
\"Play with this,\" he stressed.
But I especially appreciated the following advice: “For the job you need to know the rules perfectly”
\"You can then begin to counter it,\" said Jakub.
Finally, I understand why we are trying to learn these rules, what to do with, to what, why, while in fashion magazines we sometimes see something else.
No statement on fashion shows.
I know again, thanks to the fashion photographer Ben that the stylist must have much more dress variants than those who are photographed.
That is to say that for fashion story that will have a dozen pages (and then a dozen models) I have to be ready to cut - at least a fortnight.
And also, a garment and its combination with other elements appear completely different than in reality.
We have to rely on this in the course of creating a model.
The fact that the image and style sometimes make half of the success was confirmed by Honza Pokorny.
Just look at Madonna who is not a super singer but her image and marketing made her a world star.
In Czechia, the approach to the use of stylists remains fragile.
And the known faces sometimes view them as useless (it's enough that I know something but what I seemed to be going to the second rank).
And if someone gets a styling on our part, then we have to rely on the fact that he tells us with a great probability a completely different size (smaller) than he actually does.
Then we have to navigate on google and make sure that boulevard info reports the celebrity in question, whether it has lean or fat etc.
Honza and Mario have asked us Sunday about the heart that it is not enough for the stylist to go in fashion and know how to assemble models.
He must communicate with the people he wears and it is so important to be a good psychologist.
To know how to guess people, not to flatter themselves, to retain their opinion.
\"When a manager asks you to sort out his closet and fill it with new elements you can't throw everything and tell him, My God, what a horror.\"
“You’ll find some things you’ll find nice and he’ll advise you with what to wear,” says Mario.
It has shown us concretely what must be contained in everything called the \"placovka\" or the stylist's bag.
It's the one you hang around the size and you have on your own for everything you need.
In addition to the clearly defined things such as shears, shear rolls or feeding pins, there is also nylon thread (which the stylist uses to photograph products such as bags, or hats), special clips with which we close a garment in the back, if it is too large (the pin or other type of staple are not usable because they could thin the garment) or a sewing kit.
For us not only to be people who listen but who have tried something in a practical way they taught us how to properly resemble shoes.
And during the photo session in the workshop where the surface is equal, the sole could be damaged, to fortiori outside.
And so we glued and glued.
We did not have the right to touch the scissors so as not to hurt by inadvertence.
Therefore, there is a real need for skills.
Mario liked it when he congratulated me on my creation.
The count I'm telling about isn't for my girlfriend.
This is just a small summary of what we learned during the second course weekend
I'm starting to understand more and more that making styling a profession is not a walk in a rose garden, let everyone tell them what they want.
The need for speed The Run is fighting all over America.
By Way of Review
Initially, a smooth race is transformed by a set of stupid mistakes of people who have nothing to do with a routine morning shift to work.
It fills up to a certain extent everyone's ambition but it does not serve anything if no one wants to do anything else.
The new sub-title The Run has produced great expectations before its release.
He promised to take a new direction with the already old Need for Speed racing series and to come out a sort of game from the playable parts that would not only count with points.
So we were curious how the passages will be added in which the main hero comes out of his car and does what he wants.
As already done in the NFS series, the result is completely different from what was attenuated.
These are potentially arcade racing games but the whole shoots down because of some unnecessary mistakes that have already existed for several years.
These are not really mistakes but rather the expression of an incomprehensible hunger on the part of the developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You are caught in the adventure of which the main hero Jack has kaacterial problems and to settle them starts to participate in illegal races across America.
You sit behind the wheel on the west coast in San Francisco and your mission is to arrive first in New York.
The idea has interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten steps and then in more than 50 races.
As a result, each race takes place on another route and the steps planned in different environments that distinguish each other quite well and are interesting.
The player doesn't have a feeling for a single moment that the game offers him something unique.
Some environments are quite beautiful even though the technical level is of the same type as the previous series.
Finally, it's not the end of the world.
But driving through the desert, in autumn landscapes or in high snowy mountains is very pleasant visually.
The tests are in addition to time accompanied by an atypical element.
For example, in the desert you find yourself in a storm of sand that makes you noticeably diminish your visibility.
Then in the mountains you must be careful that an avalanche does not fall on you.
In addition, the different races are well arranged behind each other.
There are only a small number but that is enough.
There are moments you will try to overcome the number of opponents (as in a classic race) and then you will run against the watch (duel classic with the timer) and then you will expect another duel with an opponent.
From time to time you also have the police who enter the game and try to make the situation difficult.
The novelty is the out-of-vehicle passage.
It's rather an interactive animation when Jack runs away most of the time in front of someone and you need to help him by typing on the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
What is surprising is that there are fewer times of this type than what you expect (to be concrete there are only three).
The result is as well because this element is not likely to interfere and is placed, in the context described above, in the elements that accommodate the game.
The driving model is in the tradition of previous games.
Which means that at present there is nothing extraordinary but cannot be said to be negative.
As for the realistic simulation, you will have to go to the other side.
But although we can find better in the competition the driving model goes very well with the type of design of the races.
So it's okay.
Problems begin to appear after a certain amount of time.
In the difference between the driving model, the collision model is not yet in place.
We don't expect this game to be complicated deformation and collisions, but when you don't, in a collision with any object, the least idea of how your car behaves, it's not entirely good.
During the tight excesses you sometimes touch each other slightly but otherwise your self share in crazy volts.
Or it's found in socks.
Thanks to the rebooting system it's not really a problem but it really gets you upset.
The reboot is done so that when you broke the picture or went out in the decor the game brings you back to the moment of the last point on the route.
But you only have 5 restarts.
When you have used the 5 restarts you must restart the game from the beginning.
So it's more of a tool, in case something doesn't happen the way it should, than something you can really count on.
Sometimes the reboots do not help and the solution must be found by remembering the piece of route in question.
The great achievement of this game is that the same actions are found in the same places.
For example, there are some turns that have to be done in a certain way otherwise it doesn't happen.
Otherwise you meet at a given location of civil vehicles - always in the same configuration as you arrived first, fifth, 5 seconds in advance or one minute in delay.
What angers these are situations when you see the opponent pass easily between two cars coming in the opposite direction and when you arrive, you need either to stand aside and twist them or to slow them down.
It's equal if you go before him because it's -- it's -- it's -- it's calculated -- so that for the given situation it always happens near your nose.
Opponents still have other advantages.
Throughout the game, you, you arrive in some places, again without worrying about time, and you still have the same opponent who precedes you in the same place.
This boils the most at the end of the game when you drive on a long bridge in the opposite direction.
The opponent must come before you at all costs.
When he passes in front of you he hides the view of the other vehicles in the opposite direction and you go into collision a number of times.
You can understand that the purpose of this game is to do something captivating and full of adrenaline, but it is clear that you get bored quickly.
And it's bad because through a simple driving model the game is interesting and the places with so much action that you don't have the time to follow everything that's going on.
And it's equal if it's because of the concept of 50 unique routes, that the order of the races is such that there's no chance of getting bored or something else.
The original idea is the change of car during the races.
You must pay attention to the petrol pumps on the routes because you can change cars there however most of the time that you have enough.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are ideal for cities, big American cylindrical for right highways and super sports cars at exotic sights on very technical routes, for example on the lacet roads in the mountains.
And the mode of challenges, which are races in particular places that you know of adventure, goes very well with the main regime of history.
You receive not only medals but also points of experience that are in addition to your profile that is common to challenges and adventure.
When you have reached the highest level of driver, different objects begin to unlock:
This one connects online with the Autolog function which, among other things, compares your results with those of other players and provides you with other functions in the community.
One of the most difficult blows to understand is the situation of the last race of adventure.
You arrive with your car in the subway tunnel (similar) where you drive in the dark on the tracks (similar).
Your speed indicator tells you between 150 and 200 km/hour (a priori) and behind you comes a subway that sends the car directly to the scrap metal.
In writing we had a discussion for a few days whether someone really thought about the creation of this game or whether the authors really took us for fools.
The technical part of the game is not extra, but the visual part is generally pleasant and in some cases really super.
What is disturbing is that in more extreme situations, the imagery does not hold the level and in some cases tragically.
This mainly concerns accidents with a large number of participants when a fluid imagery no longer serves you at all.
The sound part is good and the track is the choice.
In order to please the greatest number and especially the most to the young public a new soundtrack has been created in the style - I mix everything - but one can expect that no one will buy the game for music.
General Impression of Need for Speed: The Run is therefore really confusing.
If the game did not have these stupid mistakes we could say without fear that it is the best production of NFS in recent years.
But this game gives the impression that it's not over.
The fun is really good but prepare yourself for the faults hitting you in the eyes with the strength of an aerodrome reflector.

Vicenova, Ambassador to the European Union:
Czechs behave as negativists and eurosceptics
The Lisbon Treaty radically eliminated the balance between the institutions.
\"I didn't expect such a hard war.\"
“This will last 5.6 years before the situation calms down and all players get used to their new role,” said Milena Vicenova, who began her presentation at the Faculty of Law at the Czech Embassy near the European Union.
When she was able to describe the various bodies of the EU and their relations in such a understandable and visible way, to the point that a large number of lecturers at Charles University's Faculty of Law could send her away, she showed how she took her motto - understandable and openly about Europe - very seriously.
Mrs Vicenova paid tribute to the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new Permanent President of the European Council.
\"From the beginning he resounded the criticisms that he is fade, that it is a round-the-clock, that he cannot fulfill any mission and I must say that he has cut off the breath to everyone because he holds his role in perfection\"
\"He is a man who can listen to 27 member states, communicate well with them and has a clear vision of the direction to be taken from Europe\"
She explained the new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Defence Policy in the context of an answer to the question: \"Who is who in the European Union - - What telephone number I have to call - therefore as an important step towards unity and greater legibility of Union policy in the face of states, such as China or India.
No one wants to forbid us from our syrecky (cooked pasta fruit that feels very strong)
Mrs Vicenova also mentioned the agenda she had lived, lived and lived in the near future of the European Council.
It qualified the Czech presidency two years ago as a success.
The Czechs resolved the financial crisis, the gas crisis or organized a Summit for an Eastern Partnership.
She described the fall of the government as very negative and damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
Czech representation in the EU is now very busy.
According to the words of Mrs. the Embassy, the activity has beaten its full - not only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis that continues to resolve again now.
The new Union septic budget, which is becoming very complicated because of the current economic situation, must also be approved.
As it would appear that the budget will be thin and for savings, which branch will be the priority, which countries will be most aided, at least, all must be resolved in the context of future negotiations.
The Ambassador recalled her slogans with which she arrived in Brussels - For an understandable Europe -
\"I really don't like abbreviations, foreign words, jargons that no one understands.
As the citizen must understand that it is true that in Brussels no one makes round or twisted horns, bananas differing in size or even that no one has forbidden us to make syrecky -
It wants to make better use of the EU's environment and see more Czechs in the European institutions.
A multi-speed Europe awaits us
According to the Embassy, Czechs have the reputation of being Eurosceptics and people who see things only in their negative aspects more than positively.
In addition, she is sorry to see such a small Czech representation in the European institutions.
The fault is the result of several factors, such as the timidity of our candidates, their inability to write a letter of motivation and low support from the Czech side.
In addition to a successful Czech Presidency, it then highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
\"Believe me, when you come to me the Polish, the Magyar, the Slovak, this Frenchman says to me, 'Hey, what are you doing there, what is still doing this group of Visegrad - and he's not happy at all -
According to Mrs Vicenova, in the near future, new tough budgetary policy rules await Member States.
It is the concept of a two-speed Europe, if it is not at several speeds, which prevails rather than a new European Federation.
\"We have countries in the euro area and others outside the area\"
-We have the Schengen area, we also have the institution of enhanced cooperation -
In the first place, it was said that the countries that want it and those who do not want it are co-operated among them.
\"There will be a lot of such institutes and there will be a really two-speed Europe,\" said Vicenova.
From this point of view it also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye to determine the basis for all EU-impact themes to be discussed among all EU members and not just Eurozone-members.
History of a brand:
The innovative IBM begins the second century of its existence
If someone had to look for the vocabulary that expresses the IBM strategy as close as possible, the nearest would be the long term.
For a wide audience IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, it is a firm felt as very current and however since its creation it has been a hundred years.
The basis of this long-term strategy was laid down by the first head of the firm, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He left this slogan that a large number of global problems can be solved for little if people are willing to think.
His slogan -PENSE' - has become the imprint around which the life of a future giant will develop (and also the title of the internal magazine IBM began to be published in 1935).
It was the basis of Watson's carefully crafted culture.
For us IBM means a long-term thought of continuous movements directed toward the future.
IBM survived a hundred years due to the fact that she remained faithful to her basic values and however was not afraid to change all the others around her.
This has enabled us in our first century to transform technology, business and society.
We hope that in the second century we will reach even more - has extended for the anniversary the current director of the firm Samuel J. Palmisano.
A Well - Prepared System
Watson, in the 1930s, began to take care of his employees as Bata in the Czech Republic - IBM's people were the only of the first U.S. employees to have paid vacations, an employer's insurance plus an elegant employee uniform and a well-developed reward system for inventors and commercials.
In the same way IBM has a well-developed customer-relationship system.
Society was at the beginning of genius in the discovery of talent - as one of the first firms to have abolished all forms of discrimination and thus could have the choice.
The current plan is entirely in the spirit of the anti-discrimination strategy as it will be a woman-Viginia Rometty - who should replace Palmisano at the head of IBM.
She has been working at IBM for thirty years and is currently serving as Head of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
IBM in recent years has been doing what we call jamy, online brainstorming from what many future strategies and innovations have come from.
It's not surprising that he has a lot of ideas - in the firm there are nearly 500,000 people working.
An institution with a good name
It is the company's internal and external image that ensures a safe position in the business field.
“Since the beginning IBM had a rather institutional concept than a technological firm,” said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Professor of Economics at Harvard School of Economics and author of the book on IBM.
“IBM is not a tech firm but a firm that helps solve business problems by using its technology,” adds Geogre Colony of Consulting Forrester Research.
As the firm itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating this market.
IBM - or the \"Great Blue - as it is familiarly called to the United States with regard to its slogan - in a hundred years it has grown to become one of the largest global firms.
It is of course the most versatile technological firm - it develops software, hardware, infrastructure, hosting, consulting services at the server's products up to nanotechnology.
It has many patents from all U.S. technology firms and five of its employees received a Nobel Prize.
Its discoveries include the ticket distributor, the payment card, the financial swap, the bar code or the floppy disk.
IBM was found this year with $220 billion the second largest technology firm according to market capitalization (the first is Apple), when for the first time it passed in 1996 Microsoft.
Preview in advance
These are not all innovations and manufactures that have had the preference of the client and of the time - IBM for example did not succeed the bet on a OS/2 own operating system, the online Prodige service or the IBM PCjr computer:
“From the moment your business is built on the forward movement you can’t emotionally stay hung over the past,” noted Samuel J. Palmisano.
For this IBM has no problem building its bases on many platforms and when they don't work it goes away.
Unlike the Microsoft competitor at the base, for example, it remains under the Windows operating system.
Perspective technology
In IBM revenues, services, which are formed for one fifth by software and hardware, have a prominent place.
However, in 1990 she was more involved with the strongest hardware representative.
From the year 2000 IBM sold low-performance assets for $15 billion, during this period it invested $58 billion in the purchase of technology prospects.
It continues in investment and even from 2008, when for the first time it overcame the new financial crisis .
IBM negotiates according to the precepts of his first chef Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis has also increased his investment volume.
Did it now appear that IBM is experiencing the current crisis without being worried?
The price of the IBM action rose from 2008 to 120 percent rocket, the net profit of the company continues to grow.
The logo of the IBM firm is to change everything but not its values.
This is what we can expect from this flexible giant to master other crises.
History of IBM: From cheese slices to flights in the cosmos.
The company IBM (International Business Machines) was born in New York a hundred years ago; it initially had the complicated name Computing Recording Corporation.
She took the name IBM in 1924 - initially it was a brand used by a branch of a firm in Canada and South America.
The foundation of the future IBM was the fusion of four firms whose history is linked to the year 80 of the nineteenth century.
They had technologies such as the old - tipping - pendulums that recorded the arrival and departure of employees.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint who until 1930 presided over the Society's Supervisory Board.
Flint hired the head of a competitor company Thomas J. Watson to help lead the company.
The leader then made the shadow to the founder of the firm - it is on Watson's ideas that are based so far on the identity and culture of society.
Watson was leading the firm as early as 1952.
IBM, as its name says, began with the production of all possible machines for business and trade - from cheese and meat slicers to the register boxes.
During the first four years of Watson's leadership, the turnover increased to $9 million and the expansion of the firm began in all parts of the world.
Watson was for the firm so irreplaceable that after 40 years of leadership it was his son who occupied the chair of director, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under its direction IBM began the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s the people and computers of IBM helped NASA to guide flights in the cosmos - on Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the flight on the Moon.
Meanwhile in 1964 IBM developed the first family of computers - the IBM System/360.
The classic PC that determines the computer standard of the time with the name IBM 5150 arrived on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later IBM sold its computer factory to the Chinese company Lenovo, but bought Consulting Pricewaterhouse Coopers' company and began to deal with advice and services with high added value.
The strategy that has succeeded in IBM over the past three years - is the Smarter Planet concept - a smarter planet -
Its objective is the intelligent use of technology in areas not yet exploited, such as the transport and management of cities.
As far as IBM trade is concerned IBM has recently developed a Smart Trade platform that helps business managers throughout the business cycle.
IBM also has a strong history on our territory.
She created her branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932, then the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM RT, there is also the strategic outsourcing center of Brno.
Central and Eastern Europe is based in Prague and there is also the research and development team at the global level that deals with the recognition of the word.
Rychtarova about her unfaithful husband:
Ivette you can keep that ass, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtarova (53 years old) said, it's over!
After her husband Joseph Rychtar (53 years old) became the guardian of the body and lover of Iveta Bartosova (45 years old), Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and return home.
Only she could not wait and set clear rules for future life.
\"Pepa can come home, but not like my partner,\" Rychtarova explained.
When Darina Rychtarova gave asylum in summer in Bartosova in her home, she did not doubt that her couple would not stay.
When Iveta after 30 days insists to move from Ricany, Pepa does not push the singer back.
And he publicly admitted that he loved him.
In time Darina resigned, accepted her husband's liaison and ended up saying goodbye forever.
Rychtirova is not interested in knowing who her husband is sleeping with.
If Rychtar and Bartosova separate there will be no wife to welcome him on the step of the door of the house.
\"He is the biological father of my son and if he wants to finish his life in our common house, no one will put him out\"
\"He will no longer be my old donkey loved and lost, but a man with whom I have a special relationship - he let Rychtarova filter by showing that she has detached herself from her husband but that they remain only in a decent relationship.
The fact that Darina closed the door to him is not a problem for Joseph.
\"I respect my wife's decision\"
\"I'll stay with Iveta and I won't change\"
\"My wife has put in place a marriage on paper and I respect it\"
\"The society continues, I deal with repairs, garden, real estate, I buy\"
\"With Darina we're talking completely normal but we don't sleep together,\" said Rychtar for Blesk.
If Rychtarova finds a new love he won't stop it.
\"We don't sleep together and I don't care where she goes, who she is, and if she has a connection.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take full responsibility for myself - Joseph concluded.
The worst vices of women: Does this concern you too?
If you ask men to determine typical women's vices, everyone, like each other, is able to get them out of their sleeves.
My dear ladies, you will know in the following lines of the female vices who come to pump the blood of men's veins.
Purchases
Does your half of you comment that you're dependent on purchases?
Should you buy at least one garment a week?
Are you happy to buy and pack at the time of the balances?
In your case you can talk about buying like a vice.
Some women believe that they should restrict their passion for buying.
But you will say, which would resist the window-side of clothing stores, to look for pretty clothes for yourself and then try them all in the cabin (ideal of different colors)?
And though for most women to buy is a hobby, it can become a real hell for man.
Just remember how many times you told your spouse he's waiting for the entrance...
Constant dissatisfaction
\"I'm not too big\"
\"I'd need to get less than 5 pounds - I should start doing sports\"
“I like you.
Do these phrases not remind you of anything?
Yes?
So you are one of those women who are obsessed with their appearance.
It is not the question that you should stop taking care of yourself, but a large number of men are allergic to the fact that their partner is always complaining about his appearance.
Strong sex does not hesitate to say that the frequency of these complaints increases and the more women become poisonous.
Odre and cleanliness in the first place
It's like an infinite handle.
Wash the windows, pass the vacuum cleaner, clean the floors, make the dust, get the bathroom out - and this twice a week.
You make comments to your partner that he walks with dirty feet on his own soil, to the children who have come out of the sink, stuck the glass of the living room, and that it gives you a lot of work?
In case you suffer precisely from this obsession, try to bear in mind that there is nothing to be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness should not be the first place in the family.
However, this harmless desire for cleanliness can ruin your relationships and even family peace.
The work of survival
\"Put this overcoat to the trash\"
\"Your account puts those old socks on again tomorrow.\"
\"A wet towel has nothing to do on earth\"
If you do on your partner this sap job this way several times a day, you will really decompose it.
It's obvious that you don't think badly you want everything to be impeccable.
Maybe if the men knew, the women wouldn't have to do so much sapling work...
Defamation, Persiflation
The defamation, the persiflation, but also the insults against someone are also the same as some women.
Women are particularly involved in relationships and thus are happy to deal with subjects such as where, with whom, how and why.
Maybe each one of us lets out a little harmless persiflation here and there.
The hand on the heart, however, is a particularity of women.
But the worst are those who advise, persecute, even despise others and are for their environment - especially at work in a women’s collective - particularly dangerous.
Jagr and Voracek helped with their participation in Philadelphia's victory
The hockey attacker Jagr twice participated in Philadelphia's victory during the NHL Monday match on Caroline's ice and is again in the lead of the Czech players for the competition.
From the point of view of 39-year-old Claude Giroux, who has still made an extra pass and has been appointed the best player of the game, he has scored in both cases.
Jakub Voracek, who plays with Jagr also recorded two goals during the game.
Jagr after the match told the journalists that he had warned Giroux that it would be a great evening.
\"I told him before the game he'd give his hat-trick\"
\"I felt it.\"
“Whenever this feeling falls on you,” Jagr explained after his action, Giroux scored a goal of the first Flyers shot.
An instant later there was a second attack by the Czech team.
Voracek fought behind the goals of the Hurricanes for the palette and presented it to Maxime Talbot.
A second before the first break, the local player Patrick Dwyer made a descent, but the beginning of the second part belonged to the Flyers.
Specifically Giroux.
In cooperation with Jagr he scored three goals, then Wayne Simmonds transformed a fourth goal.
\"I love playing with him\"
\"I don't mean he's the best player in the league but he's really one of the three best players,\" Jagr said about his center.
\"I never thought I'd play at the end of my career with a hockey player like him.\"
\"I'm really happy about that.\"
\"I want to play on him\"
\"All these years at NHL the other players in the team tried to play on me, now it's my turn,\" Jagr added.
Caroline made a drama of this game because with a goal of Tuom Ruutu and Dwyer again on a penalty shot it ends with a difference of purpose.
Matt Read hasn't removed any other complications that end up two against one.
\"Pronger has made excellent attacks in our area\"
\"He hit the pallet, I took the speed and (Read) went to the furthest corner of the cage.
\"I tried to hit him, and I came here,\" described the last goal of the game from his Voracek point of view.
Philadelphia has come with this victory in the head of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav Spacek did not finish the match with Buffalo in the second third because of an injury in the upper part of the body.
The Candians did not face an experienced defender their two-butset advance lost after a 2:3 penalty shot.
Tomas Plekanec has not transformed any of their attacks.
It's the fact that the back line was sick that mainly got the local coach drunk rather than lost fists because they played the game with only 5 defenders.
\"It's null and void\"
\"We played the game with only one experienced player, the rest were young\"
\"But there's nothing to do, that's how it is,\" said Jacques Martin.
\"Replacement on replacement is not enough and we couldn't resist\"
\"We just had to simplify the game, push the palette out of our area\"
For this we had limits, added one of P. K. Subban's defenders.
Ondrej Pavelec, Czech defender, participated in the thirtieth Winnipeg attack and victory over Tampou Bay.
5 different shooters participated in Uax Jet goals, which arrested a series of 5 lost matches.
How travel prices have evolved since 1989
Until 1989 there were only 5 state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
Travel agencies at that time proposed trips especially in the countries of the Socialist bloc, as trips to the west were very limited.
Czech tourists traveled for holidays in East Germany, Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea and Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both in Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A great exception for the period from 1962 to 1972 when it was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia and then the regime began to have an inclination for the west and travel to Yugoslavia was very limited for Czech tourists.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that it was not allowed for the citizens of the socialist bloc (also for the Czechoslovakians) to travel individually even within the framework of the socialist countries.
If the Czechoslovak citizen wanted to travel individually, for example in Poland or in the Soviet Union, he needed a letter of invitation, otherwise the individual trip was not allowed.
Travel agencies at that time also offered trips to the west, however, it was necessary to do the tail all night with a sleeping bag or to have a \"good knowledge\" within the travel agency.
And even after that it was not yet won.
The agreement for currencies that were the condition to travel west was denied to the politically incorrect people who could not travel at all.
However, the Czechoslovak currency was not interchangeable and it was not possible to obtain financial resources without the currency agreement (Western currency) to travel west.
The Czechs mostly spent their vacations in the country where there were therefore many cottages and cottages that the Czechs bought and this habit lasts until now.
The voyages of the Czechs have since 1989 experienced a great revolution.
Although until 1989 the holidays in East Germany and Bulgaria were at most, Czechs spent last year abroad 4 million days of holidays in countries around the world.
The great paradox we are not aware of today is that the most popular country is Croatia where it was not possible to go freely until 1989 because part of the Yugoslavia of the time.
The abolition of visas in the last century's 90's in the neighbouring countries of the west led to a huge wave of short-term visits, especially in Austria in Vienna and Germany.
Czechoslovakians could not travel by plane to the west for a long time that everyone wanted to see at least one moment.
For example, in Paris, travel organizations made Czechs sleep in tents in parks because our incomes did not allow us to pay the hotel or a pension.
The typical trait of a journey from Czechs was at that time to take with itself its own food preserves, sausages, etc... to save.
Another important moment was also the interchangeability of the Czech krona that finally allowed our tourists after dozens of years of freely buying Western currency.
Our standard of living and the average wage have increased, which has caused another important moment around 1997.
As a result of an increasing demand for travel, travel agencies have since 1997 begun to prepare tours with air charters that have significantly reduced costs compared to previous ones.
In the late 1990s, Czechs had visa-free connections with virtually most developed countries around the world apart from the EU that later facilitated our travels.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolution tourism, when the first air charter was prepared for an exotic country, Thailand, from the Czech Republic.
Since this year, as in each year, direct air charters have taken Czech tourists to the distant hot countries; this winter will have 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.
More than 100,000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
Another interesting moment in this period that symbolizes our post-revolution development came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the EU abolished visas for Czech tourists and allowed our country to fully join the developed country group.
In 2008 also Czechs for the first time in history spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in history spent more than 15,000 crowns per person for holidays abroad, including attached charges. Crowns per person.
The General Assembly must find its President, but that could end with a situation without a solution - a bed -
Almost 5 months ago, the Czech football team is without President and the successor of Ivan Hasek to the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic is not yet known after a General Assembly which is to take place on Thursday in Nymburk.
However, there is still no agreement on which voting regulations should be adopted.
Without this agreement it is not possible to start voting for one of the three candidates.
Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are interested in the leadership of Czech football.
Hasek resigned in June and during his departure called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality that will lead football in the future.
Only during the post-Hasek era did the football go back to differences between the chambers of the Association that could not agree on a common candidate.
This was shown completely on September 16 when a new president had to be selected.
The delegates of the General Assembly met unnecessarily in the National House in Prague because the negotiation remained blocked and it was not even a matter of dealing with how to elect.
There was no agreement on who has the right to vote in the General Assembly - only, as a whole, the statutory representatives or also the full-fledged officials.
In this single point, there has been a partial agreement since then with the assistance of the Office for State and Law, that representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
Differences continue with regard to the election settlement.
It is too clear that the Executive Committee, which in its planned or extraordinary negotiations, has not brought anything to the situation either
Opinions on the possibility of voting have changed several times, but the neural point remains the same.
The question is: how to proceed for the third round so as not to fall into the bed.
“The apple of discord is the following: either to proceed in accordance with the statutes or to find another model - one of the three vice-presidents of the Association of Football of the Czech Republic Dusan Svoboda representing professional football in the association.
According to the rules of the proposed model won in the third round that of the candidates who will receive the most votes in percentage in the chamber for which he is a candidate.
Moravia is ready to retire in order to win the candidate who will receive the highest percentage of voice from the two chambers.
And the Czech side considers the condition that the winner should have at least two thirds of the voting percentages.
\"Only this would cause the idea of two previous rounds to be lost, and it would completely deny the bicameral concept - Svoboda admits that he understands the objections of the Moravian party and that it would be best not to change the settlement and vote in accordance with the statutes in force.
It is surprising that Tomas Paclik also agrees even though he believes that the settlement of the elections established according to the statutes benefits the most Pelta among all the candidates.
I would like to see as much voting as possible in accordance with the statutes of the Association.
\"So that there are not yet any saugrenous ideas imagined by a representative as in the past General Assemblies,\" said Victoria Plzen's owner, who is a candidate for the first time and who in his presentations has defined himself above all against Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him in Nymburk there will be a new President and he believes that candidates will cooperate in the future together and constructively.
\"The possible qualification today at the European Championship should calm everyone\"
“The football will again be on a wave of happiness and there will be more training for cooperation,” added Jablonec’s officer, who among the three of them has the greatest experience in directing both professional and regional football.
Rajchl is more pessimistic.
\"I believe in this agreement but unfortunately the situation is very tense\"
\"This is not a problem between the Czechs and the Moraves, but there are tendencies to want to change the design regulations.\"
“This can cause a blockage again at the General Assembly”
\"I hope that good reason will win,\" Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for a common agreement between the parties.
Some reunions should take place directly in Montenegro but can tell if the entire leadership of football will be complete for the match.
The specially chartered flight in which they were to travel to Podgorice, among others Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, did not take off for technical reasons and sought a variant to take part of the executive committee to the field of reprisals.
At the end, it is the ministerial meeting, which could take place on Wednesday, which should be decisive.
The Minister for Youth Education and Sports Joseph Dobes would be very happy to receive the torn parts of the country's strongest sports association and bring them to an agreement.
In the game there is a lot: a state endowment, the credibility of football and also the General Assembly of the Czech Sports Union that must determine the management of Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclik is going to fight for the President's position because he does not see any correct candidates.
If the leader of Plzen Tomas Paclik's footballers had seen before the General Assembly whose profile would have responded to everything he asked for for a new President of the Association of Football of the Czech Republic (AFRT) he would not be campaigned for this high office.
\"If such a candidate exists I support him, I fight for him and I don't come to the election\"
\"But in the present situation, it was not possible to find such a candidate,\" said Paclik to the Czech Press Agency (CTC).
Paclik's motivation is to compete with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl to try to prevent Pelta from gaining access to the AFRT's head which would be favored in advance for this election.
Paclik also points out that if he wins the elections, he will hold this position as President only until 2013 for a General Assembly.
He would see well in the function an experienced and high-level manager but that is not related to the world of football.
\"I talked to people who would have the profile,\" he said.
\"To me this was terrible when some told me that they didn't want to be identified with Czech football right now\"
\"I'd like to change this picture,\" he added.
What is said, mainly PAClik, is the relationship between Pelta and the President of the Regional Football Union of Plzen Roman Berbr, a man of the controversial reputation known in the behinds as a lobbyist capable of influencing the votes of delegates 'the General Assembly.
For Paclik it is not acceptable for Pelta to take this position as President.
\"If he won, the current state would remain and there would be nothing new in football\"
\"And with the support of Berbr, who is a high-flying trader, it would be even less favourable to football,\" PAClik proclaimed.
What shocks him is the fact that Pelta's name was pronounced a few years ago in the course of an investigation into a corruption case, for which Pelta went without any penalty.
\"I don't know what Pelta prestige would bring to football\"
\"And how would we be considered in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA,\" said Paclik, who said some time ago, \"if Pelta becomes President, I sell Plzen's club\"
In the event that Paclik would succeed on Thursday's vote, he should prove that he could cooperate with Felta.
Rajchl, another candidate who had been supported by Paclik before the September General Assembly, which had ended with a fiasco, thought the same thing.
\"He (Pelta) would be the first one I would go with\"
“He has great capacity”
\"He would be able to present himself for example as head of representation\"
\"But as manager of the Association he wouldn't be able\"
\"I don't put my nose in what I don't know,\" says Paclik, who in September drew great attention when he spoke for the annulment of the Board of Arbitrators with Ludek Macela who replaced Dagmar Damkova.
Paclik claims he would be at the level to lead the Association.
He took as an example his ability to lead private firms and that he has also been leading the Plzen club since last year, which celebrated with his support in May last year his first-class triumph.
\"I have the strength to change something in the world of sport and to bring a certain culture to it\"
\"I would slow down the influence of certain interested groups that have, for example, a tendency to influence the disciplinary and appeal committee, which leads to poor taste situations,\" added Paclik, who does not seek his antipathy for Sparta Daniel Kretinsky's head.
It would also consider harmonizing relations with the Czech Olympic Committee, whose lobbying power with high-level policies would allow more money to be obtained for sport from gambling taxes.
\"This is one of the key points the new President should deal with.\"
\"If this is the gambling tax as declared by the political parties, I understand their arguments, but they should also say where the money goes,\" he said.
Paclik does not take his current liaison with Plzen's club as something negative even though he himself states that the AFRT President should be - above the parties -
Pelta is again connected with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla de Prague.
\"This is not the ideal\"
I see no reason to transmit my actions from Plzen's club to someone if I have to come back a year and a half later, said Paclik.
Pelta has promised new statutes for AFRT that should put an end to bed situations.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association one of the candidates for the Presidency Miroslav Pelta promised that if elected, the AFRT will have new statutes that should put an end to future disputes regarding the election settlement.
Jablonec's official is before the Thursday meeting in Nymburk very optimistic and believes that the success of football representation today should calm that war before the vote.
Pelta, before the September election that did not take place, promised to devote himself to national representation and to obtaining financial resources if he was elected.
He decided to be a candidate at the last moment just before the past General Assembly and this two-month delay might well enable him to defend his vision of football management and present it in a broad context.
\"People at all levels have been playing football for a long time and wait for a president to come Thursday.\"
\"They feel that this is the best time for someone to take the lead in the Association,\" he added, \"but it is primarily connected with the club of Jablonec, has worked for many years at Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Union.
That is also why he has enough experience to lead the Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the election there is an euphory that reigned in the time of Ivan Hasek.
“Unfortunately at the June General Assembly of the Statutes were approved, which were not as perfect as all saw.”
\"If there were not all these various interpretations we would have had a President since September -Souligne Pelta.
It is precisely the revision of the most important document of the civic association that has taken all the attention of delegates.
\"If I become President, I take it as a personal mission and I am ready to take all the responsibilities in case it doesn't work.\"
\"This is a principle we cannot exist without,\" Pelta added.
Then he strives, we say, not to confront his opponents.
He had previously stated that he could cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl that he recognized his legal training and that he knew that his opponent-candidate would be his first Vice-President.
Nor has he attacked Tonas Paclik for a long time, who on the contrary does not stop criticizing Pelta.
\"It has evolved in football for a year and has already had some success\"
\"But his attacks were not the most honorable and surprised many people during the campaign\"
\"That is also why some now have doubts about his character,\" said Pelta at his opponent's address, but he remains, he says, faithful to the proclamations he made in September.
His strongest weapon is according to him his knowledge of football from the lowest-level competitions to national representation.
It should be a football vitrine.
\"And I would also try to complete all the cases that begin with the Bohemians or the aftermath of the corruption scandal.\"
\"I would immediately enter into negotiations with the public and private sector so that we can get enough money for the whole football,\" said the Czech Press Agency CTK the 46th candidate two months ago.
He also added that his nomination to the football leader would bring no change in people.
\"I should get acquainted with all the employees,\" he told Strahov where there has been an understandable nervousness since there was no direction.
Although there are disaster scenes planned with the General Assembly, he believes that delegates will not go to Nymburk for anything.
\"If there's only one point of disagreement about how to vote on the third round we'll get over it\"
“Football needs credibility and will only get it when a new leader is in his head,” Pelta optimistically declares two days before the day probably decisive for his career as a civil servant.
Rajchl promises that under her direction AFRT would start working hard
“If the current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl is elected new President of the Czech Republic Football Association at the General Assembly Thursday this would not please many people, it seems.
However, Rajchl promises that if he is elected, we will start working hard.
It wants systemic changes and makes members of the Executive Committee responsible for the various areas of football.
He also promised to settle the Bohemians affair, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work started by predecessor Ivan Hasek.
\"As President, I want to take care of football as a whole.\"
\"International contacts with UEFA and FIFA through national representation, professional football and a successful youth football\"
\"But I'm not saying that I'll do it all alone,\" Rajchl said in an interview for CTK.
\"I am a team player and want to distribute skills within the Executive Committee so that each member will take care of a specific area.\"
\"And I will distribute difficult missions to make football face a big step forward\"
\"Many people will not be happy because it will be to start working hard rather than criticizing others,\" he added.
He said that he would not stand as a candidate because of a critical atmosphere.
\"About me, we know that I work 20 hours a day\"
\"But I need to know if it's worth the shot and if I have people behind me who will constantly put sticks in the wheels and cast doubts on each of my actions - explaining why he hesitated.
\"Many people have told me that I must not give up because they would also give up\"
\"It's a trust I can't betray,\" he says.
What motivates him, we say, is also to continue the work started with Hasek.
\"Since the last two years, there's been a great deal of work and I don't want to let it go.\"
\"There are processes that have been launched that will have consequences in a few years and I would not like someone to stop them,\" he said with fear that in the case of the election of Miroslav Pelta the situation within the Union will not come back as it was before Hasek.
\"I believe in systematic work and this is something Mirek Pelta cannot do\"
\"And there are people behind him who would play football in such a way that it would only be for those who have been chosen\"
\"We can blame myself for a number of things, but surely we can't stand any one.\"
\"I'm trying to be objective.\"
I want to play football for everyone because everyone will love it not just those who have been chosen
And he confirms again that he would only be a President for Chechnya.
\"And if there are those who say the contrary, I am ready to do my utmost for Moravia\"
\"For example, it's time to consider that the second division is divided into two parts by one Czech and the other Moravian, whose winners would be in the first division.\"
\"There wouldn't be a situation like currently with only three Moravian teams in the division because the problem is currently finding young players.
As Tomas Paclik, president of the Plzen Club, entered the competition for the position of President, Rajchl cannot assess his own chances of winning.
\"I still feel the support of the Czech House which elected me its Vice-President and knows that there will be successes with me,\" said Rajchl, who is considering among his future successes to save tens of millions of crowns on disadvantageous contracts, contract negotiations with televisions and the Gaming Act.
On the contrary, he says that the fact that the Association is not united is a common fault for all.
While he says about Pelta - that he is disqualified because with him the Czech football would lose his credibility - he thinks that the second opponent Paclik is a strong candidate who has something to offer to football.
\"No one can question Plzen that he did a wonderful job this year\"
\"If he was elected he would certainly continue in what was started by Hasek and would not make a significant change among the people in the Commissions\"
\"He would not want to spoil his success,\" said Rajchl, who evaluated his rivals.
The most beautiful pools in Europe
A jump in the blue
From Julia Stanek
Pataugeories in the optics of ovni, beautiful pools of Budapest: who travels across Europe can live his blue miracle - and after having turned the city or made a long walk - can let rest his tired legs in gas baths.
A book shows in which swimming pool you can experience the most well-being.
When Iris Meder went on a search trip for the last 18 months, there is an object that should not be missed in his luggage: his swimsuit.
On her back in the water, she observed the artistically arranged coupons, and swam against the Putten marbles that waited for her on the other side of the pool and did not fail to admire Art Nouveau meticulously restored these converted pools.
If she enjoyed a covered swimming pool, she noticed in her notebook without delay all the details worthy of interest on the type of construction and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools have been screened in this way by the architect Meder and presented them in her book already published: \"Badefreuden (Joies du Bain - The municipal covered pools of Münich, the historical bathing palaces in the black forest, \"hardcore concrete buildings\" in the Taunus.
It has led its travels to the most exceptional baths in Central Europe - in 13 countries. Apart from Germany, Austria and Switzerland, it has visited places in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia respectively.
The 46-year-old German is a true fervent of bathing culture.
Meder, explains that she doesn't have much interest in sport, but he feels attracted to water in a totally different way.
It is annoying that swimwearers should just look at blue tiles and get comfortable with the Javel water fountain while the joggers breathe from the scent surrounding spice forests or can listen to the park's jogging jogging birds.
\"I wondered one day why the pools must in fact be so ugly,\" said the Viennese.
“So I started a collection of beautiful baths”
The surface of the water doubles the architecture
A dive into a swimming pool and volatile sauna oils - a factor of well-being in swimming rooms are huge because all senses are awake, according to Meder.
And if the builders would have gotten a little more pain, the swimming rooms could be a real delight to the eyes: \"Instead of a floor we have a surface of water in the swimming rooms\"
\"It is on the one hand transparent, but it reflects on the other side however the beauty of the entire building\"
All surfaces appear optically in a double way: high vaults, multicolored tiles, diplins.
The small image volume - Badefreuden - makes a 190-page interesting report on the history of architecture and culture on the oasis of historical well-being - it certainly gives a desire to make a jump in the blue.
The Meder collector discovered remarkable examples during her research in Hungary.
Along with the splendid wellness baths such as the 100-year-old Szechenyi bath in Budapest, it found water containing nitrate in a natural cave in the kart (cavern bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a bath of thermal baths whose basins are filled with water containing alkali and (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény) and located in a bottle-shaped building.
On the other hand, the heated outdoor swimming pools of Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views. While a roof of the Zürich bath has the whole city in its eyes, you can admire the naïve Arlberg from an outdoor swimming pool of St. Anton: The Turkish bath is equipped with a window from which you can observe the animation on the ski slope.
Perhaps the most extraordinary pool design awaits swimmers in Längenfeld: The Aqua Dome Ötztal looks like an OVNI that just landed on the Alps.
In winter, steam rises from the three open plateaus, while in the background rises the mountains from the Ötztal to the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
The smell of Javel's water does not emanate from all the pools in the Meder collection.
Many thermal baths produce a smell of sulphur, from the Árpád-spa in the Hungarian Bekecsaba, a strong smell of oil, which is hard to believe, to find itself in a healthy spa.
The smell comes from the therapeutic alkaline waters containing carbon hydrogen that is almost black and its lemon glues you to the skin as soon as you let it slide into the pool - a special spa experience.
During her search for beautiful pools, Iris Meder also suffered disappointments: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free outdoor swimming pool and outdoors from Czechoslovakia, she found herself in front of a barricaded plot.
The bath designed by architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902 was closed in the meantime.
When she took a look through the window of the building-Art Nouveau in red-white-yellow, she observed the development of weeds among the tiles.
She observed an opposite effect in a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: Bad Wildbad's spa palace.
This building has already survived three phases; it can be discovered not only neo-Roman elements that come out from its design in 1844 but also an Alhambra-style Maure room that was added to it in 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the thermal palace has remained the favourite pool bath of the expert, Iris Meder - and not only because it originated from Schwarzwald.
\"It's already a beautiful performance that melts construction styles so different in such a formidable unit,\" said Meder.
With such a palace, diving in the thermal pool is apparently only a minor question.
Agricultural speculation
The German bank examines in detail the speculation on raw materials
By Christian Teevs
Does the German bank abandon its speculation on raw materials?
According to information from SPEEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann commissioned a working group to seek the consequences of speculation for the poor in the world.
In January, the head of the group would like to draw its consequences.
Hamburg -
For citizens of the Federal Republic, the thing is clear: According to a study, 84% of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate on raw materials such as corn and wheat.
Two thirds of the respondents even require that the German bank and other credit institutions break down this business avenue because it increases the problems of the poorest in the world.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on the order of consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report submitted by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In this article, author Harald Schumann emphasizes that the speculation of Global Raw Materials Awards, pushes prices upwards, and that banks share complicity with world hunger.
The consumer protection campaign is concretely aligned with the leader of the Deutsche-Bank, Josef Ackermann, even though big banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act the same way.
The speculation on raw materials was initially introduced to protect merchants against price fluctuations.
But the majority of experts in the meantime share the view that beters have given up offers and demand - and take advantage of the costs of the very poor.
Ackermann responded to the criticism of American competitors: He promised to investigate the complaints and said, \"No matter is worth putting the good reputation of Deutsche Bank into play\"
According to the information of SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently considering the accusations of Foodwatch-Report.
The review must be completed by the end of the year, then the results of the Deutsche Bank's Board of Directors must be presented - with recommendation, usually.
At the end of January, the head of the Bank will indicate the consequences to be taken.
This could result in a reduction in the market for raw materials, or even a complete abandonment.
Ackermann built his Image
The chief of Foodwatch Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time confirmed his criticism of the financial sector: \"The speculation about rising food prices shows in a particularly dramatic way, to what extent today's banks are damaging to the general interest\"
Ackermann is the first banking lobby to be under special obligation today.
“The Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio, for which money has been invested on food speculation,” Bode said.
‘It does not matter, for Mr Ackermann, whether it concerns the hungry or whether the reputation of the Deutsche Bank is at stake —
Ackermann's awareness may appear at first sight surprising, but it is clear that the Group's CEO wants to present a perfect picture, a few months before leaving his job.
The Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the President of the Board of Directors will not change anything to what is planned in the Board of Directors.
It could improve its brand image with a abandonment of controversial agricultural speculations.
And about possible losses, he has little to worry about - his successor will worry about it.
One in two would cancel the investments on raw materials.
Foodwatch strives to maintain strong pressure on the Manager.
Up to now more than 30,000 netizens have already participated in the organization's campaign.
Bode published the Mardi survey, with which on 7 and 8 November the Institut Forsa conducted questionnaires with 1001 people.
Just eleven percent have found this legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investments for which bets on food prices are made.
Many of the bank's clients would also draw personal consequences if they learned that their bank was involved in such operations: one out of two would cancel all the investments for which money is injected into the raw material speculations.
43 percent would discourage such a bank from surrounding them, 49% replied that they would think about the termination of their account to change from banking to banking.
21st house in Vienna
The Pavilion that moved
D'Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with tops, bottoms and a Happy End: the Austrian pavilion for world exhibitions in Brussels in 1958 won prizes, was a museum in Vienna, remained empty and fell into ruins.
Now it is again open and keeps place of exhibition house.
If we are excited about a modern post-war architecture, for its clear forms, glass hangars, lively and bold heights and new construction materials that are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the Austrian architect Karl schwanzer's pavilion for Brussels's universal exhibition in 1958 is a good and famous example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion once received the \"Grand Prix d'Architecture\" for its steel and glass construction, light and suspended.
The construction is considered to be an important step in contemporary architecture.
He made the architects so famous, that he also built the Pavilion for the next Austrian universal exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder house of BMW and its adjacent bowl-shaped construction in Munich, it finally became famous internationally in 1973.
His draft pavilion as a temporary construction had been exhibited after the universal exhibition in the Swiss Garden at the Southern Vienna Station, was transformed, and in 1962 a 20th century museum opened -
But the building was neither physically nor technically suitable for a museum - no walls to hang the works of art, so not a good environment.
However, it has been used so long, until contemporary art receives a new building in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and has become increasingly weak.
Now architect Adolf Krischanitz has transformed the Pavilion, he now bears the name \"House of the 21st Century\" and will in the future be used as a museum for contemporary art.
On Tuesday evening the Belvédère Museum opened, where the house belongs, the first exhibition - a lucky shot at all points of view.
The new departure was completed by Agnès Husslein-Arco, who became the new director in 2007 of the Austrian Belvedère gallery.
Husslein-Arco, has promoted an art historian to a considerable career among others in his youth as an artistic skater, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as the founding director of the Museum of Modern Art in Salzburg, has carried out the transformation work with political men and the protection of monuments, obtained public funds and private sponsorship and established the exploitation of them.
Except for contemporary art, works by sculptor Fritz Wotruba whose foundation bears the same name have been exhibited there, a café and a bookshop are located there, and an office must be built there.
Strict monitoring, small budget
For the Krischanitz realization was therefore the ideal interpreter.
Not only that he had transformed and expanded with sensitivity the secession of Joseph Olbrecht and that he had won the competition, but because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna and that for him the pavilion was - an extremely important place - where he had seen - practically every weekend - the exhibitions.
He knew the original project, and he knew the problems of the building, which lost in generosity and lightness as a result of his travel to Vienna and his change of use.
During the current transformations, there were major problems: the building was - a gouffre in energy - said Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facades were changed, the glass insulating reinforced in glass fibers was laid and the roof replaced by a special safety glass.
The thermal bridge pulleys have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled coatings have been rehabilitated.
Two basements have made room for the new farm, a sign of light between the house and the road ensures lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - it is almost a new construction, but always the light Pavilion Schwanzer.
The exterior doors of origins have remained, the house is painted in a shade protection against red-brown rust.
And the cinema is even exactly the same as it used to be.
And all this under close supervision of the competent authorities for monuments and with a small budget.
“Often materials that are good and inexpensive should be found, and which also please the protection office monuments,” said Krischanitz and he draws attention to a rough ground in the basement.
Despite all constraints, problems and transformations, the building remained flexible and light.
This would have been difficult with the Pavilion, which came from Brussels, said Krischanitz recently, a typical story of \"Drop-in-the-City.\"
Such architecture is still in the wrong place, and it still wants to awaken the good conscience.
But in this case the House of the 21st century is not in the wrong place, because if it is a chance of urban construction: around the Swiss Garden it is precisely the \"quarter of the central station - all new planned, with offices and apartments.
And another lucky shot may occur: the House of the 21st century could benefit from the reinforcement of another construction Krischanitz, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berlin temporary art center, and as he says, she is already negotiating with the city in order to obtain a site in the vicinity of the Swiss Garden.
Bahn plans a winter crisis package in millions.
The railway company has developed a crisis plan, which aims to avoid train accidents in winter.
The number of employees should double.
It costs millions.
In the fight against winter-season train accidents and delays, the railway company -Deutsche Bahn - will spend more than 70 million extra in this regard this year.
The daily -Bild-Zeitung reported in advance by calling for an internal crisis plan in the group, that investments of a total of approximately EUR 300 million would be planned until 2015.
This should allow better availability of vehicles and rail networks also in the case of extreme weather.
The number of internal and external employees for the snowing of railway facilities and docks should, among other things, double and increase to 16,000 people.
The objective is to clear the snow and ice docks until the start of the service phase and 90 percent of the track equipment required for service within four to five hours.
Two months ago the Head of Rüdiger Grube Station warned the government and industry at a conference at the summit of train accidents that also occurred this winter.
Last winter the railway company has had enormous problems for the transport of users, because it lacks inter alia reserves in case of difficult weather conditions.
As a result, many new regional trains have been waiting for permission from the Ministry of Railways for years.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway company has for years had what to do, since it had to check the axles of the ICE trains clearly more often at the workshop, after a break of axles took place on an ICE in the central train station in Cologne.
The German bank -Deutsche Bank - pays millions of penalties in the USA.
After the case of Chief Josef Ackermann there is something new in the USA: the German bank -Deutsche Bank - must pay a fine amounting to millions.
As if the problems of the Deutsche Bank were not enough, the past of this giant in the sector caught him in addition to the USA: the Frankfurt Institute pays in comparison to $145 million (106 million), to settle a dispute due to the bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is about the sale of mortgage documents.
The Financial Market Regulator NCUA brings to large banks a whole series of charges, encouraging cooperative banks to make false promises about the purchase of financial products; they would have minimized the risks.
These documents have lost considerable value during the financial crisis and have led banks down.
\"We are pleased to have been able to find a solution to this, without the parties starting a court proceedings,\" said a Deutsche Bank speaker in New York.
The Bank has not recognized any errors in comparison.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which has committed to an amount of $20.5 million.
The President of NCUA Debbie Matz welcomed the concessions from both banks.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. cooperative banks and intervenes in the event of bankruptcy, in order to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to repair the damage caused by several billion dollars.
The comparisons now concluded are the first in their kind.
The regulator also took other large separate banks and in summer he signed before the JP Morgan Chase Court, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
As regards the issue of mortgage documents, it is “Mortgage-backed Securities”
Credit houses are at the base.
When the U.S. real estate bubble broke out in 2007, this was fatal for a large number of banking companies.
In September 2008, at the top of the financial crisis, the U.S. Lehman Brothers' investment bank collapsed.
Even though events have already occurred for a few years, at present it is blowing on American banks a wind of storm.
Investors and supervisory authorities have sought numerous remedies for redress or punishment for misconduct.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the largest wave of complaints.
It blames 18 major international banks, both American real estate finance Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for being in-kind advantage of mortgages of approximately $200 billion.
The Deutsche Bank must also appeal to the FHFA, which is a multi-stakeholder operation of a total amount of $14.2 billion for the years 2005-2007.
The supervisory authorities request, however, that Frankfurter respond to \"substantial losses\", but without citing a precise amount.
The Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as unjustified and stated that it wanted to defend itself.
WARREN Buffett increases by 10 billion in IBM
Buffett, the financial gurou, invests colossal sums in IBM's IT company.
Since March, he has purchased shares worth over ten billion dollars.
Until then, the big American investor Warren Buffett explains without ever investing in IT companies, since long-term developments in companies only show bad predictions.
However, he read IBM's reports and changed his opinion on investments in this sector.
He already had to understand much earlier that IBM offers mainly services and IT systems for the IT sectors of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered a knight attack in the world of finance.
As a result, the IT IBM activity grants itself the right now to be called \"Monsieur IBM\"
Because Buffett today revealed to the CNBC economic program, he has bought IBM shares worth $10.7 billion since March.
Its investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway has thus become a large shareholder of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that IBM has never known anything about this engagement so far.
He welcomed the leadership, which even during the economic crisis had provided reasonable benefits.
\"You did a great job,\" Buffett said strategically.
IBM has for some time put IT lucrative services as the exploitation of accounting centres.
The IT pioneer, aged over 100, offers both Software and consultation as well as highly-performing business calculators.
Buffett had so far avoided technology companies.
He says he only invests in businesses that he understands business.
But on the contrary, Buffett instead attacks the railway brake, lubricant manufacturers or machines.
His Holding Berkshire Hathaway has nearly 80 subsidiaries as well as shares with a whole series of major groups such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Rück municipality.
This 81-year-old octogener had resumed in the 1960s - the small Berkshire Hathaway textile company and erected it in the rank of one of the world's most prestigious companies, thanks to intelligent investments.
However, his lifestyle is modest.
That is why it is a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of making money has earned him the nickname \"Omaha's Oracle\"
After Buffett's investment announcement IBM shares increased by one percent in the stock exchange.
\"Big Blue,\" as IBM is also known, has a stock value of over $220 billion and has Apple and Microsoft as one of the world's most valuable technology companies.
In Microsoft, says Buffett, he doesn't want to participate.
The founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend.
The threat is palpable
After the discovery of the Zwickauer cell, the Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a blood - blood - ideology that would now be born.
The killings of eight Turkish nationals and a small Greek company in the years 2000 to 2006 had an extremist context.
Following this news, Turkey and the Germano-Turkish population react with fear and concern.
For for many Germano-Turkish the spectre believed to have been dead for a long time, since the incendiary attacks of Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with this right-wing extremist context against the Turks.
There was no question, however, that there was a xenophobia in Germany.
However, the right-wing extremist network that has been detected reveals proportions that are far from predictable.
\"It's a return to blood-staining ideology.\" \"Tel was the title of the release on the internet of Turkish daily Haberturk.\"
The newspaper Sabah, on the other hand, stresses that one of the authors would have been a v-man of the Protection of the Constitution, and is concerned that the German authorities could be involved in the extreme right-wing bou bou ble.
It is reasonable that the Turkish community in Germany reacted: it called this weekend for a silent commemoration of the victims of racial violence at the gate of Brandenburg.
It was only two weeks earlier that the Turkish community in Berlin and the German and Turkish politicians had thought of a ceremony of the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
It was with cool colors that cohabitation had been staged, symbolizing a story of success.
Reports from certain Turkish media have the effect of a gifle: - Germany's gift for the fiftieth anniversary - such is the title of an article in the Turkish platform - - Haber X - which refers to the context of the series of murders.
Thus, the German publication of the Hürriyet - does not refuse to draw unique conditions.
This is the title of the chronicle of Ahmet Külahci.
He noted that people were reportedly murdered, would have paid taxes, and would have made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany through their work.
The police's action was perceived in a very critical way on the Germano-Turkish forums and they had subsequently discussed the success of their research.
Why it has not already come much earlier in the minds of the German authorities to do research in certain suspicious environments of extreme right, the authors are surprised.
More than one stands ready at least for rhetorical or even dramatic means: \"If the case continues to be grounded, it will remain to migrants nothing but self-defense and armament.\"
- That will be the best self-defense -
\"Inland peace in Germany depends heavily on the quality of information and the relevance of the punishment of the entire network,\" he wrote, \"Selen\"
What this means is that internal peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s have explained well.
The photo of the ruins after the Solingen fire is deeply anchored in German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event has shown any more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans, on what suspicion and distance from violence could result.
The attacks, however, have sharpened the sense of us in the Turkish community.
Never repeat past mistakes
In the past it was mainly the failure of German politics after the attacks which the Turkish press complained about: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the Mölln survivors.
After the Solingen fire he sent a telegram of condolences to the head of the Turkish State, he was represented at the funerals in Cologne by his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel was at the time counting in his speech, how many taxes were produced by the local Turkish population.
As if the value of a man could be assessed on the amount of his tax burdens.
The current report of the Turkish media shows once again how much the distrust of many Germano-Turkish has been profound towards the state of local law since that date.
In addition to the efforts of greater clarification and reassessment of extreme right-wing terrorism in Germany, a clear message is needed this time.
The scandalous bank of the Lake of Zürich
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS has nearly failed in the financial and skate crisis between times of crisis.
He's a German who has to lead now.
That is certainly not what Axel Weber had imagined.
After his spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank, in July he was known to occupy a position almost as spectacular in 2013: President of the Board of Directors of the Swiss Grand Bank UBS - a great step towards an unexpected and lucrative career.
Axel Weber was publicly pleased, greeted; Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its recently achieved strength and made delightful comments about future colleagues.
\"The UBS succeeded the Turnaround\"
\"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel.\"
And yet, from September it was clear that everything was going to change.
A UBS securities dealer in London had hijacked all the Bank's security systems and had set about 1.7 billion euros on fire.
The head of UBS Oswald Grübel's board of directors, a well-known banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
The President of the UBS Board of Directors has been considered suffering since then - and everyone asks: When does Axel Weber finally come back?
We have already learned that Weber can be advised by the bank as of February 2012.
And he will resume the presidency of administration in May - not in 2013, as announced by the bank on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber this becomes difficult.
He is not a banker, much more economics professor and President of the bank, and he would certainly have needed a period of adaptation.
Then he took responsibility for a bank's strategy, which proved once again that it had long deserved the title of the biggest scandal bank in Europe.
Indeed, the UBS is on one huge side - until recently, it was the largest asset manager in the world, and on the other, it has been skating for years from scandal to scandal.
Nothing, it seems, saves the proud Swiss bank.
This started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007 the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the Swiss asset manager, silent and solid, but also rude, combined it with ambitious objectives: she also wanted to become, in the area of banking investment, a very large bank.
So the UBS managed on one side in 2007 with $1.6 billion more money from an easy customer than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, it had advanced as an investment bank in the league of the world's largest banks.
That made a impression.
Former banker Hans Geiger and later bank professor for many years in Zurich says: \"I have always taken the UBS as a good bank model in front of my students\"
\"In the current perspective, we are wondering: how could I have just been wrong about that?\"
He was deeply mistaken.
In 2007 it appeared that for the first time something did not turn round to the UBS.
In the middle of the year President Peter Wuffli withdrew surprisingly, which was so far considered to be a high intellectual as well as a great banker.
A few months later we noticed why he was gone.
The division of the bank had flamed with subprime documents and had to cross over billions.
To support this, the UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs and made a cross over.
To this end, she found investors, but who, shortly before, would have broken the eyebrows: a non-transparent Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, which was passed silently, to the point that we have never even learned its name.
But that was only the first shot.
In April 2008 this worsened.
The bank was to announce again the losses of billions, the president of the Board of Directors Marcel Ospel, who was still in 2006 Switzerland's second best-paid board of directors, withdrew.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: the UBS was, in view of its investment errors, in the financial crisis before bankruptcy and must be saved by the State.
The national bank bought the UBS out of tens of billion problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for convertible bonds into shares, for which it could become co-owner of the bank.
All Switzerland has been shaken - because it has noted how dramatic it can be for a small country, to shelter such large banks.
Finally, the total balance sheet for the 2007 UBS was more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see graph).
\"We couldn't save the UBS again,\" said the bank researcher Geiger.
After the first disaster, the second disaster followed.
Just a few months earlier, the UBS had capitulated because of a tax dispute with America and declared itself ready to publish the easy customer data, which may have stolen the tax bill with the help of the Bank.
In addition, it accepted a payment of $780 million - in refund of unjustified profits from these transactions with a fine increased.
Thus the UBS has more or less published that it has helped tax fraud.
At the same time she lost something that has always been her capital in competition with the rich customers: the prestige of discretion.
After the scandal the Swiss banking secret was not the same.
This was followed by the withdrawal of the head of the Board of Directors and the chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the customer's money exodus.
In a few months' time, the bank lost its credibility in both main business sectors: banking investment due to poor speculation and asset management due to tax fraud aid.
And, as there was a bit of a calm return, and as we thought, that the UBS would get out of it, it followed this unfortunate history of title merchants: a single merchant of flamboyant title 1.7 billion euros, before the bank noticed that something was not going round.
And it's published: with risk management in the investment bank it still doesn't seem to work.
\"With the Adoboli case, it has been found that risk control has changed too little,\" said Martin Janssen, an economist and a professor of finance at the University of Zurich Bank Institute.
So the financial director of a large German bank is sure of it: the problem of the UBS is that it does not control the risks in hand -
However, it was exactly the idea of prudence, with which Swiss bankers had long taken over, that of becoming guardian of the great fortune of the world: not too great risks, but security for money - and the world could well collapse beyond the Alpine republic.
The treasures of the Swiss banks had become the symbol of unwavering reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli are for a particularly noble chocolate.
The UBS plant in Zurich is still paired with the solid cliché of the private Swiss bank - it's just a little bigger.
The situation is already classical.
The Bank has its seat at the Zurich Central Station, which leads directly from the central station to Lake Zurich, which itself is surrounded by the snowy peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings are prestigious here, the shops rents are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelry such as Tiffany's, are found here among the stores of Swiss traditions as well as those of the Srüngli Confesserie.
For centuries Swiss bankers have resided here: from the national bank through the palace of Crédit Suisse to private elite banks such as Julius Bär.
We arrive in the entrance hall of the UBS through a heavy door.
Inside, the walls are covered with marble, in front of them are thick leather chairs, and next to the bank logo, a large label for \"safe\"
The UBS knows what the client is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has a day or other deviation from the market - or betrayed the two major Swiss banks, the UBS and Crédit Suisse, as the leader of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He would rather not read his name in the newspaper, eventually as all Swiss bankers did business with both large banks as well.
The UBS would have become too big, it finds - especially in banking investment, where Anglo-Saxons would also have spread.
The Swiss would have said nothing more.
\"And yet, for a long time, they have adapted to the hearts of the Anglo-Saxons\"
This was indeed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank that changed the UBS, it made high profits and then the gap: no European financial institution has lost as much money in the sub-prime jungle as the large Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on October 15, 2008.
\"This Wednesday the government coalition of the small country to the seven million inhabitants has undertaken the greatest rescue operation in the history of their nation,\" writes author Lukas Hässig in his book \"The crash of the UBS\"
With about 68 billion francs, or 45 billion euros, politicians have agreed to save the large bank from bankruptcy.
How could that happen?
If we talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially at the size of the UBS.
In June 1998 two of the three major Swiss banks jointly concluded a huge group.
A bank was created, which was already too large for small Switzerland - and has consistently registered an increase.
What helped is that the two different predecessor banks of the UBS have completed: a rich bank, but in lethargy with as strong point asset management in Zurich and a poorer, but certainly already more highly internationalized.
All of a sudden, international investment banks have had favourable access to a lot of money, with which they were able to turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with the rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 Head of the UBS group, and Marcel Ospel, formerly president of the board of directors.
\"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team,\" says the bank researcher Hans Geiger.
\"Wuffli, the great modest intellectual, which is very well understood in models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive, who has frayed a path to the top with the learning of the bank\"
But Ospel would have trusted him until the end of Wuffli.
And Wuffli would probably have made a decisive mistake at the end: \"He thought his models were reality,\" Geiger said.
\"It's a tragic fall.\"
Tragic, maybe.
One thing is clear: the exuberance came before the fall.
The staff of the UBS clearly remember the meetings of the leaders during which the leader of the Wuffli group always spoke the same word of order: dethrone Goldman Sachs.
The U.S. bank was the world's most powerful investment bank.
She ordered the \"League Tables\" - the rankings, which documented the success of the banks at that time.
After all, the UBS wanted to go all up.
Some steps have already succeeded.
In the case of foreign exchange and securities transactions it has played a very important role.
The company advisors, who had the responsibility, however, pointed out a weakness: in international transactions of interest, in the banking jargon -Fixed Income - there would be a huge difference compared to the largest banks.
The UBS would have deficiencies in U.S. mortgage products.
To fill this gap, the UBS launched into an adventure, which almost cost him his life.
As a result, it is the bank itself and a management fund created before it in the U.S. sub-prime investments that have invested.
It became a massive machine that packed and passed the value documents based on American mortgage loans - but which also retained risks.
Even when other banks have long sought to descend.
\"Even in the summer of 2007, while the U.S. real estate market was in flames, the UBS bought it there,\" said Geiger, the bank expert.
The bigger the euphory the more the fall is brutal.
One manager after the other had to leave, when putting an end to the attempts proved to be more difficult than one thought.
Positions at UBS have become ejectable and are so far bankers.
The one who runs the big bank has an almost impossible task.
He must find a strategy for a bank, for which all the suggested business models have disappeared.
The bank researcher Geiger already has an idea: putting an end to the investment bank, concentration on asset management, return to the Swiss roots.
But the bank doesn't want to (still) go that far.
But the investment bank must be vigorously atrophied, so much so far as this is clear.
Thursday next the bank leader Sergio Ermotti wants to present to the world his future strategy.
The 51-year-old Swiss Italian was only supposed to be on a transitional basis when the bank separated with surprise from its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, it has imposed itself: it must carry out the UBS's business on a lasting basis, it has communicated to the Zurich Bank on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to the state of progress in the mid-1990s.
It cancels 3500 jobs.
But that's not enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money for?
These are the questions that Axel Weber has certainly already asked.
He says publicly to date only that he was going to seek an apartment with his wife in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on the American stock market
The threat of a recession in Europe at the end of the week discouraged American investors.
The change of government to Athens and Rome remained without impact.
The industrial production on the continent has stifled the hopes of stabilising the debt crisis in its germ.
The general relief on the change of government in Rome and Athens could not be imposed.
The euro has fallen compared to the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass I had only half-full last week, not half-lived - but now the problems are pressing again in the foreground, Mark Luschini von Janney Montgomery Scott said.
Especially the financial values were on the sales sheets.
The default values of the Dow-Jones-Index noted a loss of around 0.6% to 12,078 points at the closing of the markets.
During trade, the market barometer fluctuated between 12027 and 12170 points.

In Frankfurt, Dax ended with a decrease of 1.2% to 5985 points.
Industry in the 17 euro area countries has significantly reduced production and adjusted at the end of the recovery.
As announced by the Eurostat Statistics Bureau, companies produced in September, 2% less than in the month before.
American investors expressed themselves skeptically: “We are not an island, on the other hand dependent,” said Steve Goldman of Goldman management.
Europe will not soon be able to recover from a recession, there are other signs of weakness from banks.
The legendary investor, Warren Buffett, only confirmed this caution: \"It is not yet clear whether Europe would be strong enough to do something to end the crisis,\" he said in an interview at CNBC.
Therefore, it was from his point of view too early to invest in obligations from European states and banks.
Instead, Warren Buffett has thrown an old principle of several decades into the wind and enters the American technology industry.
Its investment of over ten billion dollars to IBM supported the course of the actions of this traditional group, and enabled it to note almost 1%, against the trend of commercial management.
The paper ended up almost unchanged at $187,35.
Buffett claims to have paid an average of $170 per piece, and now holds 5.5 per cent.

Smart horns spread in cities
In many places, friars are considered \"bird problem\" but experts say that these very intelligent animals have not been allowed to hunt cities for a long time.
Some like them, some others want to get rid of them as quickly as possible. Cornellas have belonged to the city for centuries, but in many communities the complaints of residents multiply because of the dirt and noise of animals.
An antidote to the \"bird problem\" is not yet in sight.
During the first ostfriesisch symposium on the cornellas, the experts said that it is no longer possible to hunt down the colds of the cities.
Experts from all over Germany have deliberated on possible solutions.
They're looking for alternatives in the cities.
Nature's protectors were also based on the problems of cities on the exodus of the particularly protected pests: The use of chemicals in agriculture increasingly destroys traditional vital spaces.
Hunting, arranging and slaughtering typical couvation trees made life difficult for birds.
The horns are under the protection of nature.
There are large colonies with over 600 pairs of couvation in the westfälischen Soest, in the northwest, among which Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project had won negative advertisements because of the cornella slaughter in that region.
Critics have found the capture of birds in traps and their killing with particularly brutal gourdins.
\"The normal expulsion, the obvious, is of no use,\" noted Leer's planner and landscape, Werner Klöver.
The destruction of nests using pressure water or cutting down trees often produces adverse consequences, said Environment Expert Manfred Kaiser de Lahr in Bade-Wurtemberg.
\"The animals move away, the large colonies split and they disperse in other places\"
It can only be imagined in exceptional cases such as hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
\"We find ourselves obliged to live with them, we can no longer exterminate them\"
The problem is not solved in cities without the inclusion of the periphery, according to Mayor Wolfgang Kellner's opinion.
Conceivable is a combination of animal development with adversive packaging and accruising offers, in order to allow them to relocate elsewhere.
Psychologist and ethnologist, Uta Maria Jürgens was looking for information signs instead of cutting-edges in order to establish completely different relationships with the following: \"We can finally better support a button in the face with a dose of self-confidence\"
Jürgens co-founded the Ascheberger-leading-educational of the crows at Schleswig-Holstein, road signs informing about the life of these very intelligent friars.
This project was adopted in the meantime by tourists.
Jürgen gave his own opinion about the criticism of bird noise: \"This is a great number of communication, these birds have a lot to say.\"
The intelligence and skill of animals are legendary: Freights do not only use work tools to reach a norm but they make their own tools as tools for work.
Ethologists at Cambridge University recently tested four cools, as far as bird intelligence is concerned.
In an experiment, the birds soon learned that they had to build a scaffold with stones to reach a larva.
Without much training, they firmly recognized that a stone must have some size and shape to collapse the platform.
In a second test, the cunning horns were then to solve a more impoverished problem.
In a vertically positioned cylinder, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a larvae.
Birds couldn't reach their butin with their beak.
However, the researchers had made pieces of iron available to them.
All four animals formed a hook with the help of which they fished the small bucket of the little pipe.
Three of the four friars were successful even from the beginning.

The favorites Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and also Ireland will participate in the 2012 European Championship.

Jiracek set a goal for Czech
Finally, Ergang Stark's referee of Ergolding is at the centre of all attention.
After an attack on Helder Postiga during the Bosnian penalty, Stark decided for Schwalbe and showed the yellow map to the Portuguese (36th).
On the other hand, Stark granted a penalty of 11 metres played at the controversial hand after an action by Fabio Coentrao that Misimovic may have diverged.
But, after the break, the 2004 European Vice-Champion succeeded four times and everything became clear.
For Czech, Petr Jiracek also ended the last doubts during the 81th minute.
Thus, the 1976 European champion will go for a fifth time to the EM.
Coach Michal Bilek's team with legionnaires Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg) also had the chance and had to survive a moment of shock in the initial phase.

Montenegro had its greatest potential when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic marked the 40th minute of the rotation on the repair surface just next to the shooting of Cech.
After the break, the crossing had to come to the aid of the world-class security guard of the Czechs who had once again shot down the attacker of the FC Seoul had been replaced (50th).

While the national coach Guus Hiddink also had to leave his seat on the third-party bank in 2002, the Croats were able to rejoice at their fourth round at the end of the European championship.
In the presence of 31,000 spectators at Maksimir Stadium, the Turks had almost caught a dream start.
Selcuk Inan scored the seventh minute with a long-range shot only the pole, attacker Kazim Kazim could not even bury the ball for the purpose.
After the moment of fear, Croatia has increasingly gained control.
Even after the break, the Croats didn't let anything burn.

The slaughter of personal masses
Peter Englund's new book offers depth and generosity. Titled “The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War” (Beauty and sorrow: an intimate history of the First World War), it begins with a long list of characters that warms your heart.
A tip to start: carefully tear this page and make it your own page.
You will learn about these people in detail. In this Romanesque account of Peter Englund, this list of characters will be your GPS, a beacon during these moments where, like one of his men or women, you will be disturbed and desperate in the miseries of war.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, who delivers the Nobel Prize in Literature.
He wrote here a book out of the ordinary that he accurately described as an \"anti-history book\"
It contains some known names, important treaties or famous battles; there are almost no ambassadors or discussions on strategies and equipment.
It's not so much a book about what happened, he explains, as a book describing what it could look like -- we find the \"feelings, impressions, experiences and moods\" there.
\"Beauty and sorrow\" summarizes the wartime experiences of 20 more or less ordinary men and women, on both sides of the war, from young schoolmen and botanists to climbers, passing through doctors, ambulances and sellers.
A few will become heroes.
Some of the prisoners of war will lose their members, become mad or lose their lives.
Their lives are emptying here like the candles of a church: while some abstain, there are a lot of new ones.
Peter Englund's book differs from traditional history books.
He denied the idea that World War I was only summed up by the terrible war of the trenches on the Western front.
- Beauty and sorrow - it skillfully describes other war theatres: the Alps, the Balkans, the eastern front, Mesopotamia and East Africa.
The soldiers present in this book are in ruins; a Christmas pass in Egypt under the pyramids; tsé-tese flies are an intrepid problem.
This book is moving from the first page.
The war invades the lives of these people such a natural disaster, such as a hurricane Katrina who can rope it.
When cannons pull away, and you're a mother at home, do you stay or do you run away?
Who will come anyway?
Almost no one can understand what happened, or even the reasons for this war.
According to Peter Englund, - the lack of facts has been overcome by assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors -
“Beauty and sorrow” follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English food in the Russian army, as well as Richard Stumpf, a young sailor of the German high sea fleet.
Their stories are mainly drawn from memoirs, letters and other documents already published.
The versions of their lives can be terrifying or exciting, but they are most preserved thanks to the accumulation of small moments and isolated details.
Most of them address deprivation and the ability to get away with it.
In telling the story of a German schoolgirl, Peter Englund writes: “Ersatz, everywhere ersatz.”
- Replacement coffee, false aluminum, rubber imitation, paper bandages, wooden buttons -
He continues on replacement food in Germany.
He describes the rice-made beef crushed in sheep's fat (and finished with a fake wooden bone); tobacco made with dried roots and dried potatoes skin; and wood-shoes seeds.
He claims that -837 authorized substitute meats are registered in the production of sausages. 511 substitute coffees are also found -
Some stories address honor and courage.
An American recognizes his own drive towards savagery and declares about war: “You feel that after all, this is what men were meant to do, rather than sitting in a comfortable chair, a cigarette and a whisky by hand, reading a newspaper or a best seller, rather than claiming that such a varnish is synonymous with civilization, and that there is no barbarity behind your shirt pressed and nailed.
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he is likely to die, and that no one will notice or pay attention to it.
\"When we are refused to sacrifice, we hope to have an audience - he writes.
Unfortunately, it is somewhat comparable to a man convicted secretly strangled.
Other comments concern the decline of an old Europe and new types of terror.
\"The conflict is becoming increasingly a history of economic competition,\" wrote Peter Englund, \"a war between factories\"
He seizes the arrival of what he calls a new species in the early century's cattle: the murderer of a well-articulated mass and ideologically convinced, in well-cut clothes, who executes his butcher's shop while sitting behind a counter-
People act in unexpected ways; there are as many basic behaviors as there is heroism.
Peter Englund speaks of soldiers who tried at all costs to catch a venereal disease in prostitutes in order to avoid service to the front.
\"We find the most grotesque expression in the pus trade due to gonorrhea, which soldiers buy and spread on the genitals in the hope of ending in hospital,\" he writes.
\"The most desperate ones apply it to the eyes, which translates into a blindness to life.\"
In this translation of Swedish by Peter Graves, Peter Englund's prose is flexible but not hostile, perfectly suited to his task as humanity.
In dozens of short scenes, he grasps the way in which the war has triggered uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, a social revolution, an aversion to religion.
People begin to wonder why their leaders are fighting them.
The best works dealing with World War I are often indirect, such as “Great War and Modern Memory” (The Great War and Modern Memory) by Paul Fussel, or - To the West nothing new - by Erich Maria Remarque, rather than complete.
Peter Englund's work is an unconventional pantheon.
The end of the book is the most overwhelming I have read in a non-fictional work.
I won't reveal it.
But it's like he came out of his book, grasping from your hands this page where the list of people appears and burned with an allumette.
After a first false step, a carefully planned operation
Hundreds of police officers have been involved, some wearing riot helmets.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because the Zuccotti Park would be empty.
The operation remained secret from all quarters of a few high-ranking officers and others informed from the very beginning that they were going to conduct an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the heart of the operation, his presence highlighting the risks and challenges for the police department.
There could not be any repetitions of episodes in recent weeks, such as the use of pepper gas against demonstrators, who went against the regulation of the department and generated a storm of public solidarity for protesters.
The operation to clean the Zuccotti Park of its demonstrators was deployed after two weeks of planning and training.
The police had prepared themselves by observing the conduct of occupations in other cities.
A capital exercise was held on Randall Island for the operation at Zuccotti Park.
Police officers receive better training against riots - anti-terrorist measures that consist of rapidly moving a large number of police officers - to focus on the Lower Manhattan district.
The last training session took place on Monday evening, next to Manhattan in the East River.
The orders given to move into the park were reached - at the last minute - said a regular, referring to the operation as a - a simple exercise -.
“The few police officers I know and who were called didn’t know they would go to Zuccotti Park,” said the person under anonymity.
\"They only know that they would go there are at the top of the hierarchy of the Police Department\"
The city was able to retain a lesson, from which the secret of the operation.
On 14 October last, police wanted to clean up the park, but hundreds of demonstrators informed the plans.
The Tuesday operation involved officers from various police units, including operational forces from all over the neighborhood - dozens of officers used in particularly criminal quarters.
Mr. Kelly said that many people were going and coming to the park during the day, in the way of migrants, so an hour in the morning was a good time.
\"It was appropriate to proceed when the park had the least people,\" he said.
Emergency vehicles equipped with spots and speakers gathered on Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before intervening.
The lights and recorded messages with loudspeakers seemed to intimidate the protesters.
As community affairs officers entered the park equipped with their clear blue winding, many protesters simply gathered their business and left.
No tent was hit before 1:45 said the police, which left time for the occupants to gather their business.
Other police teams were seen on the perimeter, ready to intervene if arrests were necessary.
Journalists present inside the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the spokesman for the Chief of Police Department, claimed that this measure was only taken by security.
But according to many journalists, the police would have prevented them from observing the intervention inside the park, which was harshly held by the officers.
Mr. Browne said that the television camera trucks on Church Street along the west side of the park were able to capture images.
While the police were moving west across the thick business of protesters, including luggage, plastic lawn, and bags of sheets filled with clothes, teams from the sanitation department followed, cleaning up everything the occupants left behind.
The few protesters who refused to leave were dragged. The images were broadcast on the Internet shortly after.
The main group of protesters took place near the kitchen of the camp, not far from the center of the park.
Some formed a barrier that the police moved to stop methodically.
About ten people at the camp's epicenter hanged together.
Finally, two people joined trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Emergency services were called to cut the chains.
No arrest took place in the park before 3:30 said Mr. Kelly.
According to the police, the cleaning operation ended about an hour and a quarter later.
According to Mr. Browne, nearly 142 people were arrested in the park.
most of it is public order and rebellion.
Joseph J. Esposito, head of the Police Department, is the most qualified officer to be found on the scene.
Phil T. Pulaski, the head of the detective department, was also present.
Mr. Kelly, although present, \"did not lead operations,\" said Mr. Browne.
A second group of police officers were patient along the eastern side of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case of necessary intervention.
Barricades were placed on Cortlandt Street, a pulp of houses north of the park, as well as on Pine Street, south.
We saw the police expand the perimeter well beyond the Zuccotti Park.
Several officers, most equipped with shields, were even seen pushing people away.
About 28 people were on the north side.
One of the most vivid actions of the night took place south of the park.
About 5:00 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protestor jumped on the hood of a police car. Others were seen cracking the tires of a police truck.
At one point, a tip of plywood appeared in the crowd.
Finally, a police officer and a demonstrator were hospitalized.
The school aid union continues the city for dismissals
The union, which represents hundreds of school aids that have lost their jobs last month, plans to institute a trial in the city on Wednesday for unnecessary and discriminatory dismissals. The impact is disproportionate on schools hosting disadvantaged schoolchildren.
The prosecutions are probably the ultimate weapon of the union, Council of the 37th District, to try to cancel the dismissals.
Six hundred and sixty-two school grants, parents' coordinators and other employees, who were among the least paid in the city, lost their jobs last October 7th. Trade union leaders compared these dismissals to a political vengeance for not having allowed the city to access a health care fund run by the workers' groups, and which would have allowed the budget gap to be closed in the past spring.
The municipal authorities categorically denied this charge.
At a municipal council hearing last month, Chancellor Dennis Mr. Walcott stated that the dismissals constituted part of the budget closed in June.
One member of the Council replied, noting that the dismissals of school aid were not specified in the budget at all.
The officers of the 37th District Council stated that they would comply with a claim notice, warning the Department of Education that it would be pursued; a press conference will be held on Wednesday to formally announce the judicial proceedings to the Supreme Court of State of Manhattan.
Dennis Mr. Walcott and the city's education department will be the defending party. The complainants will be represented by eight workers who have been discharged, all black or Latin American, such as most of the school aids that have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesman for the legal department of the city, stated that the municipality had not yet been able to see the reasons for the trial and therefore could not comment on the allegations.
According to a draft complaint from the New York Times, the union would rely on the number of dismissals in the city's most disadvantaged schools to support its complaint against unfair treatment, stating that the poorest schools would lose the most aid due to regular underfunding.
While there are no layoffs on Staten Island, and just a few in Upper East Side or TriBeCa institutions, 17 school aids have lost their jobs in the 23rd Brownsville District, and 46 in the 8th and 9th Districts of the southern Bronx Districts.
Noting the loss of five out of eight students in public school 36 Harlem, where 68% of schoolchildren live in poverty, the prosecution claims that \"This is not a neighborhood of well-trained parents who can raise funds to fill the budget gap\"
The public school budget 36 was reduced by 3.26% this year. Funds were also lost when the city changed its calculation of additional funding for each disadvantaged student registration.
The union also claims that high school directors may have been misled by certain terms in a memorandum authorizing the dismissal of parents' coordinators.
The memo used the term \"depassion\" to describe the action, even if \"depassion\" more generally describes the action to move a teacher from a school to a group of available workers whose salaries are paid by the central office.
According to the draft complaints, \"six parents' coordinators have been dismissed\" and \"not only because of overcrowding\"
Mission completed: Congress found agreement on Libya's question
Finally, it would appear that the Republicans and Democrats have found an agreement in the Capitol on the issue of the uprising in Libya.
There will have been a successful uprising, the capture and death of the long-standing dictator Muammar Kadhafi as well as the American involvement.
The Foreign Relations Committee of the Senate will have to take a decision next Tuesday, supported by President John Kerry (Democrat - Massachussetts), with Senators John McCain (Republican - Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent - Connecticut), applauding the Libyan people for their revolt and American troops for their \"courage\"
“This resolution is to honor the courage of the Libyans as they begin to rebuild their country,” said John Kerry.
\"This is bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations\"
Language may be harmless, but the debate on Libya has never been simple to date.
This summer, legislators from both parties came into conflict, as well as with the White House, on the formulation of several resolutions to approve or not the United States military role in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution authorizing the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated by a wide bipartisan margin and never voted in the Senate.
But on the same day of the Bill's failure, the Chamber of Deputies also rejected a measure aimed at reducing the financing of US operations in Libya.
The U.S. mission remained in a form of legislative purgatory - Congress sufficiently upset to criticize the management of the mission by Obama, but not enough to cut the grass under his feet.
The Congressional independence was exceeded by events.
Tripoli fell under the insurgents in August and Kadhafi was killed on 20 October last.
NATO's mission officially ended on 31 October.
The Senate can now act.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Relations -Felitiates the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and determination for freedom - and - congratulates the men and women of the American Armed Forces and their partners of the coalition engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people, for their fantastic courage and professionalism -
The resolution also affirms - the national interest of the United States in achieving an irreversible and successful transition to democracy in Libya -
Will the new measure win the full support of the Senate's Foreign Affairs Commission or will it divide the legislators as in June last?
The senator and Chairman of the Commission Richard D. Lugar (Independent) opposed the latest version.
His spokesperson said last Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not yet read the latest version of the new project.
In the Chapter, the House must vote this week on an amendment to the Constitution to obtain a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republicans in Congress, and some Democrats.
The measure, supported by the Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will constitute the first constitutional amendment to the budget, or any other question, to obtain a floor vote in the House or Senate.
Other legislators have so far failed to have their amendments approved, but this is not without trying.
Goodlatte's amendment is one of the 68 constitutional amendments to have been tabled in Congress, on a wide range of subjects.
Some are recurrent - the same bill proposed in both the House and Senate - and others are minor variations in a precedent.
At least 15 versions are available in the House only for the amendment for a balanced budget, and another one that would control federal expenditures.
Some of these bills are identical, but give their support - in particular the new Republicans who wish to give their CV - the chance to boast of being the author of such a measure.
The Budget Control Act, approved last August, called for the vote of the House and Senate on the amendment of a balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members wish to limit the number of terms of office during which members of the Congress can serve, while José E. Serrano (Democrat - New York) wishes to lift the two terms of office for the presidents.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat - Illinois) proposed a multitude of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care, among other subjects.
An amendment prohibiting marriage between individuals of the same sex is perpetually proposed, as is the amendment prohibiting the desecration of the flag.
Some legislators also wish to authorize the annulment of federal laws if the two-thirds of the States are opposed to it.
They are not as fast as they were in the past.
At the 111th Congress, the legislators proposed 77 amendments and introduced 66 at the 110th.
The cadence slowed down from the early 1990s, when members generally proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, according to the figures provided by the Senate library.
But these amendments did not have much more success than they do today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 but proposed to Congress in 1789.
“Massacre but not beaten,” says Gabrielle Giffords during her first television interview since the shooting.
Ten months after an armed man shot him at the end of Tucson, the representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democrat - Arizona) appeared on Monday evening in a television show, sang \"The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow\" from Broadway and said he wanted first of all to recover rather than return to Congress.
When she appeared in the television newspaper (20/20) on the ABC channel, next to Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords struggled to form sentences and needed help to walk.
The show addressed its difficult return following the bullet that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of the brain, crossing his head.
Three months ago, she had made a surprising return to the House of Representatives to vote on the debt ceiling text.
During his first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six people and injured thirteen others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and qualified his recovery as \"hard\"
After Diane Sawyer asked her how she felt, 41-year-old Gabrielle Giffords said, \"Most well.\"
The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, took place during a special one-hour edition of - 20/20 - broadcasted on the eve of the release of the new couple's book entitled \"Gabby: a story of courage and hope\"
The special show has retracted the re-establishment of Gabrielle Giffords since the 8 January shooting.
In videos filmed by Mark Kelly during the first few weeks, he is seen on his hospital bed, shaved head and a large scar on his forehead.
She gets to use one or two fingers only, with the encouragement of her husband.
A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords was sitting in a wheelchair while doctors taught her how to perform simple actions.
A sign of the head.
A movement of lips.
And finally, his first word: \"Quoi\"
A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords whispered another word - Toast - to ask to change the menu of her breakfast.
The videos broadcast by ABC show the important role of music in the recovery of Gabrielle Giffords: the Representative is being seen singing with the doctors the air of Cyndi Lauper - Girls Wanna Have Fun - and Tom Petty - Free Fallin - -
During the interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spends two hours with doctors every day, said not to remember the shooting.
According to her husband, he was reading an article on the 12 March shooting when she stopped him and asked for information for the first time about the six people killed during the incident.
The armed man, Jared Lee Loughner, is detained in a Missouri prison and vigorously treated pending trial.
“There were a lot of deaths,” said Gabrielle Giffords to Diane Sawyer.
‘Dur, hard, hard
During her recovery, Mark Kelly told Diane Sawyer, she said, \"I was beaten.\"
\"So I'd say, \"Gabby, you haven't been beaten,\" said Mark Kelly.
You've just been massacred.
And you're gonna get out of it, you're gonna get back to yourself, and you're gonna get stronger than ever.
More than respect for the troops
The event: a gala on Wall Street to harvest millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad on impotence, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines around him.
The crowd in costume-cravate stood at his feet to hail him.
\"The military, men and women are considered heroes,\" said David Saltzman, organizer of spring fund-raising.
A military high-graduation in the gala, also attended by Admiral Mike Mullen, Chief of Staff of the United States Army, saw the role of the troops in a different way.
\"They were presented as a sort of orphan,\" wrote the military high-graduation in an electronic mail.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know.
But it wasn't respect, just pity.
The absolutely contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationships that have settled between the military and a passionate but often distant American public.
Praises are given to the troops for their sacrifices.
But they have a certain price, they say a few military.
The public acts more and more as if he was sorry for men and women in uniform.
\"We are not all victims,\" said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who led the troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan.
- But it would seem that the only way to support us is to lock us in the role of evil spirits -
This is a very sensitive subject for military leaders, who do not wish to appear unappreciative or disagree with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger of the troops coming from the Vietnam War has been much worse.
Thus, most of the conversations about pity are held in complete confidentiality among veterans.
After the return of his two sons from the fight with the Marines, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that the public would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them respectfully because they were confronted with insurgents and traveled to distant lands.
Others would wonder if a veteran in anger and violence was hiding under the surface, said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to work in the Government in Washington.
When he was looking for a job, he said, he felt that some of the people who had made him pass the interviews asked him in a subtle way whether he would be able to keep up with the stress of a demanding job in Washington immediately after his return from the fight.
“When you approach the topic of service, you are facing negative impressions,” Colonel Cancian recalls when he speaks to his sons.
The difficulties of the military arise, in part, from the American indifference to wars.
The victories are rarely welcomed by a country so unfamiliar with the army and that it sees little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
\"As a nation, we no longer value heroism in the same way as in World War II,\" said retired Lieutenant General David Barno, who led the troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the congratulations of political men and people are largely focused on the depth of a military's suffering.
Troops are recognized for the number of periods of services endured, the number of friends lost or the extent of injuries.
Army in the face of increasing pressure to sevir against rapists
This week, a capital hearing will decide whether 28 men and women will go to trial against the army for alleged inaction regarding rape.
If applicable, hundreds of complainants will prepare the next one.
First class soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant the night she claims to have been raped by a soldier.
It was in October 2008. She would return to her barracks in Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after having had dinner with a friend, when she met a colleague carrying a pack of beers.
He asked if he could join her in her room for a drink.
\"It was an alarm signal,\" says Elizabeth Lyman.
But Texane put aside her concern.
I thought, no, he's 19 years old.
\"He's from Texas,\" she says.
\"I must have followed my intuition\"
A few minutes after he entered Elizabeth Lyman's room, the man caught him from behind, dumped by land and raped, she claims.
This week, on November 18, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other soldiers, some still in service and others not, will eagerly await the decision of justice at a historic trial to be held in Arlington, Virginia, and who will decide whether a trial against former secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will take place.
They are accused of not stopping the generalization of rapes within the army, thus contrary to the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
Ordered in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, the trial involved 17 complainants. This number rose to 28 months later - 25 women and 3 men, all claiming to have been sexually raped or abused by fellow soldiers. They also claim that the army has not investigated, prosecuted or provided adequate justice after the alleged attacks.
Susan Burke says he's taking the gallon soldiers, because the problem starts with them.
\"The army is a vertical structure,\" she said.
\"Who are the individuals in a position to eradicate the culture of reprisals? The leaders\"
Counsel also states that since February, it has been contacted by almost 400 other survivors, most of whom could be part of future judicial proceedings.
Its strategy: instead of bringing together all the complainants in this case - thus putting all its eggs in the same basket - it will try several trials, if necessary, to maintain pressure.
The defence team, for the Department of Defence, led by American lawyer Neil MacBride, filed a motion to reject the case.
The judicial documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defence strategy, and essentially the fact that the army cannot be prosecuted by soldiers on duty or not for injuries caused in the armed forces.
According to a 1950 Supreme Court decision, known as the Feres Doctrine, the Federal Government is not responsible for injuries suffered by active personnel.
“The alleged evil is inherent in the military service of the complainants” indicate the documents.
The Department of Defence refused to comment.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women still do not, officially, have the right to go to combat, this distinction is only on paper: the front lines of recent wars are rarely only male.
In Iraq and Afghanistan, women's soldier teams are playing an increasingly important role, especially in contact with local women.
As a result, over these two wars, 150 women soldiers lost their lives - two thirds of them in combat.
It's time for the army to modernize itself, says Susan Burke.
She is not alone in conducting this fight: three other trials are underway in addition to her own.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Service Centre prepares a case against the four main military academies for encouraging a misogynistic atmosphere.
On the other hand, Vietnam Veterans of America's non-profit foundation prepares a trial against the army, focusing on the diagnoses of \"strikes of personality\" attributed to rape victims in order to give them leave - a relatively ordinary fact, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwaru of the Women's Action Network Service, a human rights group.
His group tried a trial in December at the Veterans Administration, accusing them of discriminatory practices in dealing with applications for benefits for people who claim to have been victims of sexual assault in the service.
Nine independent bills were presented to Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, offering a variety of solutions.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual assaults were registered according to the Department of Defence's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Centre.
But it is well known that the number of sexual assaults is underestimated. Indeed, according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure represents about 13.5% of the 19,000 incidents that year.
The report in March also examined the percentage of prosecutions: in 2010, 20% of cases recorded in the army were tried - half the percentage of the civil justice system.
The complainants in Susan Burke's case describe their aggression as the first in a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, she informed the Military Police of rape less than an hour after the facts.
That night, she said, she was asked to report 11 times in detail her rape to various police officers, doctors and commanders.
She suffered a \"snake kit\" (literally a rape kit), and her aggressor's blood - due to a cut to her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman sat in front of a judge at a trial in which she was questioned about her sexual relations with her boyfriend earlier on the day of his aggression.
Six persons testified as moral witnesses for the perpetrator, who ended up being acquitted.
\"I remember the day the verdict was delivered,\" says Elizabeth Lyman.
\"I thought I was going to start having contractions.\" I screamed after the court.
\"I was placed in a psychiatric unit, and when I left, I remember telling my commander, \"That wasn't his trial, but mine.\"
Elizabeth Lyman was forced to consult a military psychiatrist, who ended up diagnosing a personality disorder, making it unfit for service.
In January 2010, it was referred in terms less than honourable, preventing it from receiving any advantage.
Is the Lyman case and the other complainants will move forward or not, it's a long story, says John Turley, law professor at the University of Washington Faculty of Law.
However, he points out, \"In my opinion, they should be able to move forward\"
Only this doctrine criticized since its introduction is between them and a verdict.
I've always criticized Feres doctrine.
The army is found decades ago because it does not have the same advantages and means of deterrence imposed by responsibility.
\"Hazards are heavily against them... but it's important that they try\" he added.
These things change only when the good have the will to fight.
If the trial does not turn in their favor, Susan Burke, the complainants' lawyer, will gather his hundreds of other complainants for further trials.
\"We will continue to fight the army on this issue as long as there is no reform,\" she says.
Where until we die, either of the two options.
Walls have eyes: researchers study you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was a simple guy sharing his anti-immigration opinions online.
On Monday, Breivik, who recognized having been taken from an insane murder in Norway in July leaving 77 victims, was faced with his first trial.
While Breivik acted alone, he was far from being on cyberspace: he had spent much of the time before the attack on his computer, to discuss with some of the millions of nationalists who support extreme right groups on social media sites.
After this summer's tragedy, researchers want to learn more about these people.
But how do you find them?
Easy... connect to Facebook.
“We realized that it was not so difficult to find them,” says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recently published report by DEMOS’s think tank on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook has so much personal information, says Jamie Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the website's advertising tool to find the people they have been looking for with scientific accuracy - the way marketers have been doing it for years.
Jamie Bartlett's team discovered that half a million members are fans of extreme right-wing groups in Europe. It targeted them with ads, but instead of linking them to a new group or product, the ads invited users to respond to an inquiry. The questions asked related to their level of education, their attitudes to violence and their optimism about their own future.
By getting in touch with these people through Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues were able to question 10,000 supporters of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries - without leaving the office.
\"This is a new way to do research,\" says Jamie Bartlett.
Some results are not surprising: the online supporters of right-wing groups are rather men, young people and against immigration.
But surprisingly, those who associate online and offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screen.
The study of DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook has become the new tool in the hands of scientists.
Reflection groups, medical researchers and politologists use the site to study all topics that affect health issues such as social trends, thanks to \"I love\" publications on walls and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding on average three content per day, the \"supernova of data\" generates an explosion in research, increasing the number of research works that the name of the site appears in the title of almost 800% compared to the last five years.
For some researchers, the benefit of Facebook lies in the fact that it allows you to study people that you might not be able to approach on the street.
\"Before, when you were trying to investigate the people of the British national party, it was very difficult to identify them.\"
\"You should go to the party, but they would never have allowed you in,\" says Jamie Bartlett.
\"Facebook avoids all of this - you have direct access to their information.\"
Others say that the site could provide a way to identify and address health and social problems.
According to a recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and his colleagues, young students who spoke on Facebook about their drunken exploits had a lot more chance of being alcoholic than discreet students in this regard.
Megan Moreno suggests that students' colleagues, such as advisors, could monitor the site and intervene to possibly help a student whose status would speak too often of alcohol.
“You can’t deal with a problem if you don’t diagnose it,” says the Washington Post, “Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Megan Moreno and director of the Centre for Children’s Health, Behavior and Development at the Children’s Research Institute in Seattle.
\"We know how to identify children at risk, and who would not otherwise be recognized\"
Facebook also consistently accesss the information of its users.
The team of the site that deals with the data has studied statistics on the love situation and the day of Valentine, the mid-term election rate of 2010 and a national happiness index (thanks to the information only available - the champions of digital freedom have long argued that the site could make available its data treasure to other people for research purposes).
But Facebook users know that the site observes them, whether they like them or not - in exchange for being able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, the site is allowed to access your information.
But what happens when Facebook users are part of an investigation they haven't even heard about?
While researchers have well defined guidelines on how to collect information other than through the Internet, there is something else on-line.
“I don’t think that a large number of users have already thought about the fact that a researcher can study their profile,” says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, according to a 2006 study he conducted by observing his students’ Facebook walls.
\"As long as they knew, the exchanges were only seen by their friends.\"
Then comes the question of methodology.
Even without going over the Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know the degree of truth of a profile or on a user's wall.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do in reality are two totally different things,” says Neil Selwyn.
That is why, despite his experience as a technological researcher, Neil Selwyn thinks that a blocknotes and a pen remain the best tools that can be used.
\"Nothing can replace the real world and contact with people,\" he said.
Social studies are supposed to address the social aspect - and the social aspect is not in front of a computer -
\"Froid and Inhuman\": first appearance of Anders Behring Breivik
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted to having organized the two attacks that killed 77 in Norway this summer, described himself as a resistance fighter during his first appearance at the trial in Oslo.
\"I am a military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and the Norwegian Temples,\" he explained in front of a hearing room filled with 500 people.
\"As far as the jurisdiction of the court is concerned, I refuse it, because you hold your mandate as organizations supporting an ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism.\"
\"I recognize the facts, but I don't plead guilty.\"
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he didn't want to give him the opportunity to use this trial to express his views -
For the same reason, he refused to leave Breivik, who brought him a paper speech, talking to the victims' parents at the end of the hearing.
Judge Nesheim also asked the police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, prohibited him from talking to the media for four weeks, and warned him that the authorities would closely monitor all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
Some 30 parents of survivors and victims were present at the hearing.
Some came in the hope of looking at Breivik in the eyes, others to be sure he would be placed behind bars.
All attended the hearing to see the end of the trial.
\"I found it cold and inhuman\" said a Utoya survivor on the Norwegian NRK television channel.
\"I wasn't comfortable, but I personally advanced a little after seeing and hearing the suspect.\"
Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the trial. He looked at the journalists and survivors in the eyes by entering and leaving the court.
Despite the strange idea that Breivik belongs to a vast resistance movement, the judge determined that he was not crazy. He also stated that there is no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
Therefore, the attacks of July 22 appear to be the work of an extremist rather than of a whole group of radicals, which may be comforting.
But this does not reduce the grief or confusion felt by the entire nation.
\"I would have preferred him to look like a monster, but that's not the case,\" said a victim's relative.
\"That would have been much easier.\"
7 lessons from Steve Jobs' lost interview at the cinema this week
After Steve Jobs died on October 5, some compared it to Henry Ford - distinguished by the technical engineering and inventor of modern computer science.
But what Apple fans can find more revealing in a recently found interview with Steve Jobs, which will be released this week in the first part of a film on the main markets, is how creative that spirit had understood the processes and workflows of the products.
He was no doubt a creator and a dreamer. He identified himself to a hippie but was also very meticulous and organized, as well as a better organization charts - a man who believed that many business leaders were suffering from a disease letting them think that a great idea makes 90% of the work... [but] a considerable amount of manual work separates a great idea of a product of exception -
In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the television series -Triumph of the Nerds - This series depicts the birth of the computer, and he sat for more than an hour with Steve Jobs for a long, rare conversation.
At that time, it was about 10 years ago that Steve Jobs had had to leave Apple. He was already working hard on his new NeXT computer company, aimed at popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small portion of the interview with Cringely is used in Nerds, he states that the main copies have disappeared in the transport.
It is only after Steve Jobs' death that a complete video is found in the director's garage.
This video, slightly upstream, is the basis of the 68-minute film Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will be released at the cinema on Wednesday and Thursday next.
For someone known to hate in-depth interviews, Steve Jobs seems here astonishedly excited to exhibit technological philosophies and their business strategies.
You're incredibly attentive.
On four different points during the interview, the answers come a long time after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, during which Steve Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts, in order to provide a precise answer.
There are also times when the perfectionism of Steve Jobs has risen, where he seems to be eager to hear Cringely's questions, giving him elbows to speed him up and move on to more important questions or subjects.
Filmed before the age of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, one finds a strangely relevant aspect on Lost Interview. Steve Jobs assesses what he views as good or bad in other companies and shares his own vision of the future of computer science.
It's one thing to read Steve Jobs' posthumous career assessments, but there's something gross and inspiring about the man we see here, the anxious dreamer on the eve of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and should be.
He explains them and then implements them.
Here is a quick summary of seven remarkable sequences of Lost Interview:
How he learned how to run a business:
\"For all these years, I have always asked: 'Why do you do things - and the answers are constantly the same: 'oh, just because you have to do them.'\"
No one knows why, no one thinks in depth about things in a company.
That's what I found out.
Steve Jobs continues by giving details of his efforts to simplify accounting at Apple.
Perplexed as to how the costs were recorded - it often started with a standard cost - evaluated for nose, then adjusted with a \"variation - - it developed an automated factory that guaranteed the accurate calculation of commercial costs.
On the opportunity to play a tour of the Pope:
Steve Jobs tells the background of the \"Blue Box\" that he created with Steve Wozniak - a device that used to hack phone networks and phone for free in long distance.
The device has been the subject of many previous writings, but Steve Jobs' euphoria here in his description of the Blue Box as an act of appropriation is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box using a public phone, passing a call and then connecting from one AT&T network to another while bypassing as many satellites as possible.
\"We wrapped the ball of different things half a dozen times and yelled on the public phone and it would come to you a minute later on the public phone next door,\" Jobs said, laughing.
“We were young and thanks to this Blue Box, we learned that we could create something ourselves capable of controlling billions of dollars of infrastructure worldwide.”
We didn't know much about both of them, but we were able to invent a little thing capable of controlling big things. It was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple would have a day without it.
Steve Jobs continues by telling him a wonderful tour he and Wozniak made: he telephoned the Vatican with the Blue Box in the middle of the night by passing himself to Henry Kissinger and asked to speak to the Pope.
While several members of the Catholic hierarchy are summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two accomplices are laughing just before the Pope himself is awakened.
About her love with technology (and Bill Hewlett's release):
At the age of 12, he searched the number of Bill Hewlett in the yearbook for a frequency meter and played a wire.
Soon after their 20-minute conversation, Steve Jobs gets a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
\"It had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only company I had seen at that age and it formed my definition of a business and the way employees are treated.\"
Steve Jobs later became one of the HP employees to visit the company's research laboratories located in Palo Alto, where he discovered the \"first desktop computer ever designed\"
He was as big as a suitcase, had a little cathode tube. I fell in love with him.
The teenager that I - I was back at HP and started writing programs for this machine.
On improvisation of innovation:
At several moments in the interview, Steve Jobs talks about inventing new products on a head start.
At the beginning of his career, while he moved in to sell some printed circuit cards, a client asked him to assemble a complete computer.
Working only 30 days of credit, he should take care of the assembly as well as the delivery of the finished equipment.
Later, at Apple, he recalls the difficulties encountered in developing a computer mouse:
\"I remember big disputes... they screamed at me by claiming that it would take me five years [to make a mouse that would cost $300]. I had enough, I went out and went to see a designer\"
Ninety days later, we had a smile that we could make for $15 and that would be incrediblely reliable.
On large companies that are blowing up:
Long before he revived Apple, Steve Jobs had anticipated the way many industrial leaders would fool themselves and lose control of their market share.
\"Let's say that you work at IBM or Xerox, you make a better copyter or a better printer, and after . . . .
You have the monopoly of the market, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing can change it, so [these types of people] who end up leading businesses and the specialized product personnel are excluded from decision-making.
The product engineering that led to this monopoly position is completely rotten by people who cannot imagine designing a good product in relation to a bad product - the manual work required.
That's what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
She could have done her present size ten times. Xerox would have been Microsoft of the 1990s...
They pulled the defeat out of victory.
On innovation as an artistic form:
“A huge part of manual work separates a great idea from an exceptional product... as you develop this idea, it changes and grows”
You learn a lot about his subtleties.
There are compromises to do... some things you can't do, electrons can, glass, robots, plants too.
You must keep thousands of things in mind (these concepts) by gathering them together.
Finally, decisions are made by personal taste. It is about trying to expose you to the best products that men have created, and trying to bring these things to the product you create.
Picasso once said that the good artists copy and that the great artists fly.
We are always ashamed to steal excellent ideas.
This is in part what makes Macintosh exceptional. People who worked on it were musicians, poets, zoologists, historians, who simply proved to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If it wasn't for computer science, they would have done extraordinary things in another area.
Scalia and Thomas have dinner with opponents of health law while the court meets
On the day when the Supreme Court met in private to discuss the question of political discord, namely whether the opposition to the law of President Obama of health will be heard, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were noticed at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will defend the case before the high court.
The event was last Thursday, when the nine judges met for a conference to discuss petitions for consideration.
One of the cases concerned a trial by 26 States contesting the reform of ambitious health care voted by Congress last year, a law that was a rallying point for conservative activists at the national level.
The judges agreed to hear the complaint, in fact, a monumental argument of 5:30 a.m. is expected next March, and the result will likely be in a way that will foster the destabilization of the 2012 presidential race, which will be in full swing at the time the court's decision will be rendered.
The lawyer to be held before the court and to argue about the rejection of the law will likely be Paul Clement, who served as the general solicitor of the United States during George W. Bush's administration.
Clément's legal office, PLLC Bancroft, was one of the two dozen cabinets that helped to sponsor the Fedéralist Society's annual dinner (Federalist Society), a long-standing group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored dinner, Jones Day, is one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Enterprises (National Federation of Independent Business).
Another promoter was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, which presents a huge financial stake in the outcome of the dispute.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel a few hours after the court conference on the case.
Among other things, it was Mitch McConnell, the Senate's top republican and declared opponent of the Health Act.
The best guests at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is not new: the two judges were present at the events of the Federalist Society for years.
And there's nothing that goes against the rules of ethics.
In fact, judges are exempt from the code of conduct that governs the actions of federal judges.
If they were, they would probably argue by the Code of Canon 4C, which states: “A judge may attend fund collections of law and other organizations although the judge may not be an intervener, a guest of honor, or included in the program of such an event.”
Nevertheless, the mere presence of Scalia and Thomas near two of the law firms in the case, as well as a company with a massive financial interest, was sufficient to alarm government ethics activists.
\"This violation of ethics and a superb indifference to the Code contradicts the statements of several judges that the Court respects the same rules applicable to all other federal judges,\" said Bob Edgar, President of Common Cause.
\"The judges drank and dined and collected gala funds with lawyers who had cases before the court\"
Their presence and participation in the fund-raising of this event removes all claims of impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little respect for critics claiming that they easily mix the court's affairs with the agenda of groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas's wife, Ginni, is a high-profile conservative militant.
The conservatives also claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a general solicitor of Obama's administration when the first opposition to the law was brought to the level of the trial court.
His criticisms put pressure on Kagan to refuse to hear the case, saying that she had invested too much in defending the law to be impartial.
Kagan did not give any indication that she would.
Boeing registers a record order of $18 billion for line planes
The airline Emirates orders 50 Boeing 777, two-way line planes, with the possibility to buy 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, an estimated market of over $1 billion.
There is nothing extraordinary for a company to receive an order contemplating 50 of its products.
On the other hand, it is a case when the company in question is the Boeing aircraft manufacturer and the amount of those 50 aircraft reaches the record sum of $18 billion.
Also incredible is from whom Boeing received this order: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In the forecasts published Monday, the Chicago company estimates that the airlines in the Middle East will need in the next 20 years of 2,520 aircraft of a total value of $450 billion.
During the weekend, Boeing informed of the order of the most expensive commercial aircraft in its history - 50 Boeing 777 bi-couls.
It is the Dubai-based Emirates airline that passed this pharaonic order.
Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Aeronautics Show that the airline is also likely to purchase 20 additional aircraft, which would raise the total order amount to $26 billion.
On the other hand, Boeing indicated on Monday that Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8, nicknamed Dreamliners, a model that flaunts important fuel savings and conveniences for passengers.
The amount of these six aircraft amounts to more than $1 billion.
\"It's clearly very positive for Boeing,\" said Neal Dihora, analyst at Morningstar.
“These customers in particular have immense value”
In the Middle East, oil-producing countries own many of their airlines.
They therefore not only have the means to pay these planes, but a rise in the price of fuel - usually harmful to airlines because it represents their most important costs - would not be so harmful to them as the country would earn money with the rise in oil prices.
This is an important point because these companies will be less likely than others to cancel or defer their aircraft orders when the oil price rises, Dihora reported.
\"They have a natural risk cover,\" he said.
Emirates' command reinforces Boeing's predominance on the wholesaler aircraft market and assists in curbing the rival Airbus's attempt to invade with its A350 aircraft.
Boeing's victory at the Aeronautics Fair comes four months after Airbus announces to postpone the beginnings of the largest version of the A350, which competes directly with the Boeing 777-300ER.
Airbus pushes off its beginnings to increase its momentum as customers demand it to increase its load capacity and autonomy.
Boeing's shares increased by 1.5% to $67.94.
The sister of Mexican President manifestly beaten in the elections of Michoacán
Luisa Maria Calderon states that drug traffickers helped his PRI's opponent Fausto Vallejo in the governor's race.
President Felipe Calderon's sister seems to have lost her attempt to gain access to the role of Governor of Michoacán during violent elections, and she said Monday that drug traffickers favoured one of her opponents.
The first results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Revolutionary Institutional Party, or PRI, was in the lead of the race at the position of governor of that West State.
\"The intervention of organized crime throughout the voting process and in particular yesterday is an alarming fact, not only for Michoacán but for the whole country,\" Luisa Maria Calderon reported on the radio during an interview on Monday following the elections.
\"They threatened our candidates, our election officers... they took the polls, installed roadblocks... and forced people to vote\" for the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for sixty-ten years until it lost the presidency in 2000.
But he organizes his return, and a victory in Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have noticed only a few Calderon, who was leading polls before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate for the Conservative party of his brother, the National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, a left-wing candidate for the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who is currently in office as governor, has arrived third, a painful defeat before the 2012 presidential for this divided and unfortunate left.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the first results.
Vallejo, former mayor of Morelia, the state capital, denied any connection with drug traffickers and strongly advised other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in the trafficking of marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine.
This is the State of origin of President Calderon, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
Yet, violence persisted.
A week before the elections, a PAN mayor was murdered while campaigning for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates gave up the campaign locally for fear.
However, for the PRI, as corrupt as Michoacán's elections have air, a victory will help the party in its momentum.
The man expected to represent the PRI in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, \"I think this victory is very encouraging for next year\"
BASD strongly encourages Asia to come to support the euro area
The Asian Development Bank has asked India and China to prepare to help the euro area to overcome the sovereign debt crisis in order to avoid a long-term decline that would prevent the development of the Asian economy.
Mr. Rajat Nag, Director-General of the Manila-based BASD, said that the two economic powers to the world's fastest growth had to \"do everything in their power\" to accelerate the recovery of the monetary area through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He advised the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, China) to look at Europe's difficulties with a “indifferent eye” and reported that Asian financial support alongside Europe's leaders and resources would prevent a long-term collapse of the world economy.
\"We are all together in this crisis\"
\"Therefore, anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is useful,\" he said to the Financial Times during an interview during the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
\"Asian can be protected to a certain extent but it is not safe\"
\"If China and India can help, then nothing will stop them.\"
In recent months, the euro area has been seriously shaken by a sovereign debt crisis.
Recently, the cost of the Italian loan was dangerously raised in a arrow, and the Prime Ministers of Italy and Greece resigned.
The growing sovereign debt crisis in Europe has caused fear that the world economy will not go into recession, and has called for the major emerging economies to come together to help the euro area find a solution.
Mr. Nag has argued that the IMF would provide any Asian aid, but he also said that bilateral assistance - such as buying the United States' financial rescue fund's obligations, the European Financial Stability Fund - provided greater power for negotiations with Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, the Indian Minister of Trade and Industry, said that India will do everything it can to help the euro area as its own economy is now suffering from a decline in exports and a deterioration in foreign capital arrivals.
\"No one wants the euro area to remain unstable and agitated,\" he said.
\"We have monumental challenges to face and we must maintain a high level of growth\"
\"This is not a choice, it is an imperative, because where we will find work for the tens of millions of our young men and women\"
Others argue that developing economies such as India should not help European rich people while facing their own important economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at Brown University in the United States, said that it would be very difficult to make Europe support 1.2 billion Indians, of whom at least 800,000 live with $2 or less a day.
\"One day, they will discover that the Greeks retire at 50 years of age and that they go on holiday in the sun and they will have trouble studying it,\" he said.
Lee Howell, the President of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India's reserves should be used to maintain many well-paid Greek officials in poorly managed jobs that generate losses, as in the rail sector.
Mr Nag said that the euro area crisis could cause significant repercussions through Asia.
The BASD's forecasts for economic growth of 7.5% in Asia in 2011/2012 are now facing \"risks of loss\" due to the European threat.
He pointed out that vulnerable emerging markets needed to develop -- relief plans -- to protect themselves from economic reversal and major capital leakage.
Serious warnings of the Pentagon on potential defence reductions
The Secretary of Defence, Leon Panetta, put pressure on the Congress Monday, warning that the impending automatic budget cuts would escape national security and triggered a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon corridors to Afghanistan's battlefields, through civilian rallies.
The Pentagon already digests $450 billion in reductions for the next decade, but now fears that an additional amount of $600 or more would be imminent if Congress failed to reach an agreement on expenditures.
\"The impact of these reductions would be devastating for the ministry,\" Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He stated that the failure of Congress to reach a budgetary agreement resulting from what is called sequestration would result in 23% reductions as well as the freeze of many new projects.
\"So important a reduction, so applied without discernment, would make most of our ships and our construction projects inexhaustible - you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously affect other modernization efforts,\" Panetta writes to senators.
\"We would also be forced to separate ourselves from a number of our civilian personnel, and because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we should almost certainly send civilians to leave without pay to achieve the goal.\"
\"These changes would undermine the faith of those who support our military and seriously damage our preparation\"
Reductions would eventually affect the fighting troops, continue Panetta.
\"Although the wartime financing of the accounts of contingency operations abroad is not directly affected by sequestration, war efforts would be negatively affected by serious disturbances in the core budgets,\" Panetta warned.
“Contracting personnel would be reduced, resulting in delays in contracts and supervision of war-supporting contracts”
“Wages management personnel would be reduced, resulting in delays in payment to war providers, and legal and political support would be disrupted.”
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, asking for details about the potential impact of automatic compressions on the Ministry of Defence.
\"The consequence of a kidnapping of the Department of Defence would have triggered a rapid decline in the United States as the undisputed world leader of military power.\"
\"We are fiercely opposed to this draconian action,\" Senators said in a joint communiqué on Monday afternoon when Panetta's letter was published.
\"This is not a consequence with which we can live, and it is certainly not what we should impose ourselves.\"
- Sequestration is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and should not have to occur -
That Panetta's letter and the recent warnings of senators increase the pressure for a budget compromise or an appeal to exempt the Reduction Pentagon, remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly virulent about the possible compressions, even though he has reached the highest position of the Pentagon accumulating years of budget expertise in Congress and the White House and knowing that he was facing difficult choices.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defence painted a dark picture of what might happen - a soldier with a shell but no kernel.
- It's a boat without sailors -
\"It's a bulletless brigade.\"
\"It's a fighter plane, without enough trained pilots\"
\"It is a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs that do not have enough trained soldiers capable of fulfilling the mission,\" Panetta said in her preliminary remarks to the Pentagon.
\"It is a depressed, ill-prepared and unable to cope with potential opponents\"
“In fact, she invites the aggression.”
In an addendum to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta specifically stated how new reductions could - generating significant operational risks: time to respond to crises, conflicts and disasters; severe limits to our ability to deploy and engage us in the world; and assumed unacceptable risk in future combat operations -
And Panetta stated that some of the biggest defence projects could go to the cut-off, including those already tested and some just at the early stages of planning.
This list included the Fighter F35 Joint Strike, a new planned bomber, the next generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal combat vessel and the new ground vehicle, which would replace the Army and Navy Humvee.
Ending F35 development and testing could generate $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say that this is an essential step in improving and responding to China's potential threats and other rivals.
How to Identify a Lie
A look at recent headlines indicates the extent to which deception and lying are pervasive in everyday life.
The Republican candidate for the presidency Herman Cain is busy exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women; each side accusing the other of lying.
Penn State administrators were accused of perjury for allegedly covering reports that a retired football coach sexually assaulted boys.
Last week French President Nicolas Sarkozy was taken by an open microphone claiming to American President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The lie has destroyed careers and convulsed countries.
The New York Congressman and Internet celebrity Anthony Weiner, turned to an idiot by quickly issuing denials contradicted by irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards was charged with violations of the funding of campaigns related to the coverage of an extra-marital liaison.
And then, none of the people who lived the story will ever forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton triggered in his second term on his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
The history of cheating at school and university tests is legion.
There have been cases where teachers have given the test responses to students in order to get a good look at their performance assessments.
Mentors who should teach the contrary send the message that lying and cheating are acceptable.
How much deception do we meet?
On a given day, studies show that you can hear from 10 to 200 lies.
In fact, many of these are godly lies.
Another study showed that foreigners lie three times in the first 10 minutes of their encounter.
To detect or detect lies is an essential competence that everyone must acquire, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a game of society similar to, say, charades, where the goal is to write: \"I have had you - the detection of deception is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades in prestigious universities that have conducted in depth research of such projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the oldest myths about lying have been demystified.
The liars look at you in the eyes.
They don't drink, they rust or they don't always get upset.
Do not conclude that mentors are difficult to detect and difficult to detect.
A qualified lie detector can discover the truth by examining the structure of the statement, the facial micro-expressions, the formation of the question and the response time.
I have spent several years examining scientific results in the vast body and always emerging from knowledge about deception, and it is clear that detection of deception is a modern competence that is easy to learn and useful to navigate in our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviews, negotiation or management.
Good mentors are able to read the others well, making them comfortable, managing their own emotions and intuitively detecting how others perceive them.
We know from research that extraverts lie more than introverts, that men say more lies - focused on them - while women say more lies - focused on others - - usually to protect someone's feelings - that married people lie less often to their partners than unmarried people (but that the lies they tell tend to be huge).
We also know that if you're perceived as a disbeliever, the others will feel less guilty of lying to you.
How can you tell if someone's lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of your subject.
This is what we call \"setting the benchmarks\"
This helps to provide a benchmark for measuring future changes.
Watch the posture of your subject, laugh, voice quality.
You need to know if someone normally moves their feet permanently so that you don't start unfair accusations when you see him kicking in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for signs of verbal and nonverbal misleading behaviors.
Consider these clues as red flags, not evidence of deception.
Misleading people can immobilize the upper body when they try to remember their story, they can point their feet to the door, lean towards an exit, change their posture significantly, or present a \"post-interview\" relief - an exaggerated sigh of relief, a shift of posture when all difficult questions are passed.
Interrogators often falsely indicate that the interview is completed just to try to trigger the post-interview reaction.
Also, pay attention to your subject's vocabulary.
The famous Scott Peterson went off using the past while claiming that his murdered wife was alive, triggering a national search to find her.
Misleading individuals can also use a distancing language: “I have not had sexual intercourse with this woman... Miss Lewinsky - or entirely repeat a difficult question.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of \"wood language\" when answering a difficult question: \"Well... to tell the truth... if I remember well... to my knowledge\"
This makes the response perceptual rather than factual and is often a red flag.
There is no magic formula for the detection of lies, but the development of skills to recognize deception is possible.
These skills will improve the chances of anyone avoiding victimization by scammers in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial pipeline plan will be disrupted after the United States' late-approval threat
A few days after Obama's administration threatened to delay the approval of an oil pipeline project between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico - provoking the anger of the trade unions while calming environmentalists - the company seeking to build the pipeline says it is ready to redirect the project to return it to the rails.
TransCanada stated on Monday evening that it will move the pipeline projected outside the ecologically sensitive area of Nebraska dunes, and is confident that the project will still win its approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada's officer, Alex Pourbax, says the company remains confident that it will eventually obtain approval from an oil pipeline, but with a different route.
This follows the announcement by the Department of State last week that it would delay its decision to grant a federal permit for the project until it receives further studies of potential routes to avoid areas of the dunes of Nebraska and Ogallala aquifer, from vast groundwater sources.
\"It's a real way forward,\" says Lee Terry, a republican from Nebraska to Fox News.
The new environmental review commissioned by the Department of State would probably have rejected any decision until 2013, after the next year's elections, although officials do not involve policy in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the decision of the Department of State, and expressed his support.
The 2,735 km pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would transport 700,000 barrels a day from the province of Alberta to the refineries of Texas.
In order to do this, it would have to be crossed by six States.
He is hated by environmentalists, but loved by working groups, who have put on the estimated 20,000 jobs related to the pipeline.
But the legislators of Nebraska opposed this plan put pressure on a law to force the remoteness of the Sand Hills region and Ogallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The ongoing environmental impact study of the Department of State found that the project would only pose limited negative environmental impacts, but the energy industry stated that the Department's Inspector General ordered a separate investigation of the review process, which focused on two issues.
One is that a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a campaign advisor at Hilary Clinton in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest to the program.
The other is whether a company that was hired to conduct the initial study was an inappropriate choice of its relationship with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle prosecuted for allegedly causing a young child to vomit out of fear
A New York family claims that the Diva Disco Patti LaBelle, launched in a derailment of violence in the hall of their Manhattan building, terrorized their little girl to the point where she vomited her fear.
The draw of the singer - Lady Marmalade - frightened little Geneviève Monk 18 months of age, so much so that she experienced - personality changes, sleep disturbances - and - increased fear of strangers - said her family during the trial of the Manhattan Supreme Court.
It was November 10 of last year when stage technician Kevin Monk, his wife teacher of kindergarten, Roseanna, and Geneviève were preparing to leave on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was going to look for the car, Roseanna Monk went down into the hall of their boulevard Riverside building with their luggage, carrying Geneviève in her arms.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped by the door and put her daughter in for a while.
\"Someone came behind me and said, \"You know what your daughter's doing,\" she said, \"Yes, and I went to find her,\" she said.
LaBelle was angry at the pregnant woman.
“She told me of an aggressive tone: “You shouldn’t leave your daughter near the door,” said Roseanna Monk.
\"I said to him, \"What you say or think I don't care\"
She became angry and started using swearing - the word - - and the word - - with a strong voice...
She had a bottle of water and began to sprinkle me from the bottle's water.
She said that at this point, Geneviève became hysterical.
\"I told this woman: \"Look at what you've done to my daughter,\" said the mother of the child.
LaBelle threw herself on the mother - who still held Geneviève in her arms - and had to be held by her entourage who drove her to a car that was waiting for them, said Roseanna Monk.
The little girl cried so hard that she started to vomit, she added.
Later, the family sent a note asking for LaBelle's apology, but there was no response.
Counsel and LaBelle's representatives did not return our calls to comment.
The complaint claims unspecified damages, but family lawyer Sam Davis said he took the case for free and that the family is planning to donate all the money received to a charity for cancer for children.
“The goal is to hold Patti LaBelle responsible for her conduct,” said Mr. Davis.
\"This type of behaviour is totally unacceptable, especially to a kindergarten teacher with an 18-month-old child\"
Climate adversity has slowed the economy
During the first year of management by Mario López Valdez, Sinaloa unemployment and informality increased, foreign investment decreased and the economy contracted
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdez, self-appointed of change, which has generated high expectations regarding the advances of the economy, but given the climate adversity of the beginning of the year, the increase is not observed, in exchange there is a deterioration of the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures of February, apart from the loss of trillions for the agricultural sector, limited the opportunities of the state economy for growth, caused a contraction of economic activity in general by 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, mainly justified by the historical decline of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of the other economic sectors.
According to the report of ice cream assignments from the Mexican Council for Rural Development Supportable, there have been damage of 582 million 835 hectares, of which 78.03 percent have suffered total damage and the rest of 21.07 percent have suffered partial damage, the main cultures have been vegetables, corn and chickpeas.
The decline in economic activity has resulted, up until November, in a steady rise in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the rate of state unemployment during the first three quarters of the year was seen as an accelerated increase, as from January to March 55 thousand 053 signage were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 percent of the Active Economic Population, in the second quarter the rate became 5.28 percent and from July to September the average continued to rise to 6.19 percent, a rate representing more than 74 thousand unemployed signers, an increase compared to the first half of 18 thousand 969 people.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, according to economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the rise in unemployment can be explained indirectly according to the actions carried out by public policy.
“What is observed is an increase in unemployment due to various factors, including the loss of liquidity on the market due to a restriction of resources by legislation approved in Congress to combat money laundering, because for people who earn dollars illegally it is not easy for them to work to earn them, to invest them and to use them in something,” he said.
Detained migration
López Cervantes reported that the rise in unemployment is also due to a demographic factor.
\"The number of people leaving the State to go to work abroad, in the United States has been limited, first because of the difficulties of entry and second because by entering they already have a lot of difficulty to find work, these people remain here and ask for sources of work, which causes rising unemployment,\" he said.
Lack of seriousness
The analysis of the labour market indicates that it is worse to consider the high level of lack of serious which prevails between working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the population employed in this state does not work as a worker in any social insurance institution.
Apart from unemployment and the lack of serious, another reason for disaggregating the state is low wages, the entity has the lowest wages in the country, according to the registers of the Mexican Institute of Social Insurance and the Secretariat of Labour and Social Forecast.
The average monthly revenues of signal workers were, until September, 5 thousand 352 pesos, well below the national average, which is 7 thousand 375 pesos.
Contraction of FDI
Apart from the decline in economic activity and the rise in unemployment, in 2011 the highest reduction in the Foreign Direct Investment in the last 10 years was recorded, according to the Economics Secretariat from January to June the State FDI reached $630 thousand,697, a decrease of 87.74 per cent compared to $5 million, 143 thousand,312 recorded in the same period of the previous year.
In turn, the Secretariat for Economic Development of the Government of the State has a total investment of 17,280 billion pesos per year, registered mainly by companies in the tertiary sector.
Debt
In light of the economic contraction scenario, the Government of the State called in July for the approval of a 3 billion pesos credit for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, with the objective of reactivating the economy, the approval of the State Congress was 2,600 billion pesos and until November no debt benefits were observed in any sector of the State economy.
Reactions
For representatives of the employer sector, the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdés demonstrates a lack of management capacity of the Government.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, said that in 2011 there was no harmonization of the wishes of the different sectors, including the Government of the State.
\"The performance of Sinaloa's economy during this year has been really very poor, we have to work hard to recover the land we lost this year, in 2012 we have to double our efforts, it has had to align the effort of all and above all the good progress already synchronized by this new government team, we hope that next year will be much better,\" he said.
Economic slowness
Loredo López stated that events such as ice cream at the beginning of the year have retained the state economy and have reduced its performance and growth.
\"The low economic flow is produced from several events, including frosts, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not turn fast enough to generate economic dynamism that allows to have an acceptable level and flow in trials, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we close much below the expectations we had,\" he said.
Redefine vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Patronal Confederation of the Mexican Republic of Sinaloa, said that the state is wanted to be channeled into productive activities of more dynamism.
\"In general terms we have observed that we have worked, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme that redefines the vocation and the economic direction of the State, because it is important that the full potential of the material and human resources of Sinaloa is defunct,\" he said.
A lot to do
The President of Coparmex stressed the importance of developing a vision for the future that better channels the efforts of the Government.
\"In general terms, I would say that the Government has made efforts to achieve good results in different areas of economic development, there are some advances, but it is important to develop a long-term programme,\" he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in the management of public policy.
\"There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is more inclusive, which I can say is that much work has been done and the Government is aware of the fact that there is still much to be done,\" he said.
Convicted for 8 kilos of marijuana
A resident in Novolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in fine for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Attorney General of the Republic has informed that the convicted minor trafficker is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for an offence against health, in his variant of possession of marijuana intended for sale.
In accordance with file AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by agents of the Mexican Army on 7 June 2010 during a surveillance operation on Cipriano Valdez Street, in front of number 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The small trafficker circulated in a pick-up truck of white colour, in which he carried a black bag in the vehicle's trunk and instead of the copilot a small back bag where the military found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated elements were made available to the Second Judge of the District and the convicted person is still in the Centre for Enforcement of Legal Consequences of Crimes.
Debts to contributions to books
Social works covered in programs such as Habitat, Public Space Rescue and 3x1 for migrants may not be completed where serious delays due to lack of economic resources are recorded, Miguel Ángel López Miranda said.
The Director of Municipal Social Development indicated that even though construction programmes have so far progressed, they are at risk, as the Government of the State has not fulfilled its obligations to provide contributions that exceed 11 million pesos in all three programmes.
He noted that in total, the investment of these three programmes is approximately 50 million pesos, of which the State must provide 25 per cent and so far only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for the works, so there is a possibility of delay in their finalization.
\"They must provide a contribution of 12 million and despite the fact that the year will soon end they have given us nothing, even though since July they had to give us a part of it,\" he says, \"and we, in order not to record delays, started the works and we have made a lot of progress, but we need money\"
He mentioned that last year, during the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State had not paid the corresponding contributions, so at the beginning of the administration the Municipality had to apply for a credit to cover the 7 million that the State administration had not provided on that occasion.
\"We had already suffered this in the previous six-year period because the State had not had the economic capacity to participate and the programs continue to function and this year, in order to have access to these programs, we had to obtain the resources to cover what the State had not paid,\" he said.
Despite the State authorities' commitment to provide these resources, he stated that they had requested the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to activate management so that the corresponding percentages would arrive as soon as possible.
\"They must provide almost 12 million and despite the fact that the year is about to end, they have given us nothing\"
The Court valid - the analog cut - in Mexico in 2015
Replacement of analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has suffered in recent years
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) has brought an end to the constitutional disputes that the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have expressed against the presidential decree that advances the so-called \"analog cup\" from 2021 to 2015, as the eight votes required for the invalidate have not been put together.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his duties when he issued the decree detailing the actions to be taken to implement the transition to terrestrial digital television.
With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic was halted for not having reached the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to pronounce on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality of the decree, and this continues to be in force.
The draft award, drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed the decree's declaration as non-constitutional, because the rules on radio and television are an assignment reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and reserve of law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional controversies to challenge the decree and by admitting the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions envisaged by it for the digital transition.
The plenary meeting of Ministers also resolved to resolve the complaint made by the Chamber of Deputies, without discussing the project to which Minister Sánchez Cordero is also responsible.
In his speech, the Minister President said that he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the Federal Executive cannot structure measures through general standards for public administration to prepare for it.
\"I also believe that if it were to do so, the autonomy of the regulatory body would be affected, and he recalled that public policy planning in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the Federal Executive, which is constitutionally mandated to govern the State.
The replacement of analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has suffered in recent years and this results in a better operation of the radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
To postpone the change, he argued, would be to postpone the benefits of digitisation which implies a decision of public interest that does not only have a technical dimension, but also includes economic, social, political and national security issues.
These questions, he stressed, “require the operation of a whole system established, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the State, includes a group of allocations which the Constitution grants to the faculty of the Executive of the State”
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the digital transition and have done so through the Executive, despite the fact that they had the highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, by issuing the contested decree, has in one form invaded the sphere of competence of Congress, as it ensures in the administrative sphere compliance with the laws issued by the Legislative, it ensures.
The possibility of a counting - voting vote - is analysed in Michoacán
According to the data highlighted by PREP, the difference between the first and second place of the governor's election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to the 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total minutes.
The possibility of counting - voting vote - is a reality in relation to the electoral trial this year in Michoacán, where according to the data highlighted by the Preliminary Electoral Results Program (PREP) the difference between the first and second place of the governor's election is only 27 percent, even without accounting for the votes corresponding to the 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total minutes.
In this sense, the President of the General Council of the Michoacán Electoral Institute (EMI), María de los Angeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines for harmonizing local standards to the federal electoral reform.
It will be recalled that Michoacán did not approve its political Constitution or its Electoral Code of State or its Electoral Justice Act, while the Congress of the State approved the reforms shortly before the end of the legal deadline for this electoral trial to enter into force and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted its publication within the time limits provided for in the Official Journal of the State Act, with the argument that it had some objections.
On the same November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the Local Legislative Power and described it as \"invalid and illegal\" the vote of the State's agent for constitutional reforms, as it does not have the right to \"sanction or challenge\" them.
Interviewed on the possibility of voting - María de los Ángeles Llanderal stated that, thanks to the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of IEM, partial and total counting of votes by the local electoral body will be possible.
For example, the partial counting of votes, of one or more electoral packages, it may be that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no record of voting and counting in the urn file is not found in the president of the poll; or there are obvious errors or alterations in the minutes.
In addition, the total counting of votes received in all polls may be made when there is an indication that the difference between the alleged candidate winning the respective election and the candidate who obtained the second place in the poll is equal or below a percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is an express petition from the party representative and/or coalition who presented the second of the candidates reported.
The total counting of the ballot may also be achieved if at the end of the common count it is found that the difference between the alleged candidate winning and that of the second place is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that there is the express petition of the representative of the political party whose candidate emerged second, in which case the electoral packages that have been subject to the partial counting will be excluded.
It should be mentioned that this is the situation of the election of Morelia, where according to the PRP, the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 percent, even without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total minutes.

Felipe Bacio Cortés left the city of Saltillo very young to register at the Collège de l'Air in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some couldn't believe it, because they said he even had a bad truck; but he always followed his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers that he was a very good person, when he was in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, as this was the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagun to Saltillo -

Three abandoned corpses, located in the property of Cadereyta NL
A few hours before being found, the military authority had presented to the media eleven persons who had been arrested in the same municipality for organized crime offences.
Three men were found shot dead in different parts of the body and with the blessing, in an abandoned property of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León municipality.
The discovery took place at 1.5 km of the road from Cadereyta to Santiago, in the community known as El Castillo.
Some people who went through this place observed that in the property, whose closure has the beige color and coffee the portal was wide open.
Looking inside, about three metres away, they located the bodies of three persons, which is why they immediately informed the corresponding authorities.
One of the individuals wore a yellow T-shirt with dark jeans, without shoes; next to him was another with a white T-shirt, with straps.
At one meter away there was another individual's body with a red T-shirt and blue jeans.
The three were extended over the belly.
According to the data obtained in situ, the three people had been murdered in another place, because there were no in situ showers found.
In the closure of the property there were legends addressed by one group of organized crime to the other, apart from some bullet holes in it and in the portal.
11 captured in Cadereyta

The new Italian government will be formed Wednesday
The Prime Minister appointed, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put this country on the brink of economic disaster
The prime minister appointed, Mario Monti, will meet on Wednesday with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of the economic disaster and has put the whole Eurozone at risk.
A presidential palace communiqué announced that Monti, on Sunday, would meet with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that he can form the Government.
It is expected that he will present a compound cabinet in his majority by technocrats, even if it is not clear when the new executive will assume his position.
Monti said he was going to present to the president the result of his conversations with the political parties in his attempt to form a government.
\"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase,\" said the former European Commissioner to journalists.
Monti did not explicitly say that he could form a government, but his comments indicated that the obstacles had been overcome.
The framework is now well drawn and added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, in a shorter time than usual, while Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has pushed the costs of its debt to levels that cannot be supported.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package required by European leaders to regain the trust in the affected Italy.
By stressing the pressure on Monti to hurry, the instability of the markets to place the yield of the Italian bonds BTP at 10 years above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to be saved.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian employer Confindustria, told the media after her meeting with Monti: \"We said we would support this government a lot.\"
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to come out of this emergency situation.
Monti's chances of success were greatly stimulated by the support of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, which the crisis forced to resign last Saturday.
\"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti will have a good result,\" said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the center-right party.
The support of PDL, the largest Italian party, is significant because so far many of its members have opposed the Government of a technocratic majority that Monti forms.
Parliamentary support
The new Monti government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what is likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blocking or delay in its efforts could lead to a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks added to the pressure by noting that a failure of Monti would be a disaster.
Monti started consultations with political parties, trade unions and employers' groups and youth and women's organizations on Monday.
He'll finish his round of meetings on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed Sunday by Napolitano, who has enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief review at the end of last week, when it was clear that Berlusconi was going to resign, the costs of Italian debt have now come to critical levels between uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister.
Saving Italy, with a public debt of EUR 1.9 billion, would be too much for Eurozone's current financial defences.
Monti said that his Government should continue until the future elections, scheduled for 2013, despite the generalized predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement reforms before the elections proceed.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his office, but the big parties insist that it should only be trained by specialists, an indication of their objections to a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources reported that mutual distrust and disagreement between parties complicates the attempt to include political figures.
The experience of the Spanish is superior to that of the Costa Ricans
Of the 22 footballers called from Spain, ten participated in more than 50 international games.
From Costa Rica, only one of the 22 convoked participated in 50 meetings.
A huge contrast to that of Costa Rica, compared with the 22 convened by the two countries for today's friend, at 15:05 a.m., at San José National Stadium.
While national and European champions, the number one of FIFA's monthly rankings, account for a wide range of class A inter-selection games, the Tricolore only has defender Michael Umana as the only one to have the 50 international games.
This figure was reached last Friday in the match against Panama (0-2) on Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish footballers who play in the League of Stars and in powerful clubs of the First League of England, maintain an intense activity in national league and coupe championships and disputes in European Cups such as the League Champions.
To all of this we must add the experience with Furia Espanola during the complicated eliminations of the European Cup and the World Cup of Football.
Costa Rican footballers, on the contrary, have an international experience limited to an area, such as the Concaf, which is considered to be at a lower level in FIFA.
We see that the largest record of the Spanish Selection is that of the goal keeper Íker Casillas, who on the previous Saturday against England (defense 0-1 in London) equaled the record of the former goal guard Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings.
Today Casillas will play against the Tricolore and they will impose a new record for Spain, of 120 international games.
Xavi Hernández, head of Barcelona, in 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized the previous week by UEFA alongside the other centenarys of the Iberian team, Zubizarreta mentioned above with 126 and the front center of the Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
Near the centennial figure is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
It is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61 and David Silva, with 53.
On the Costa Rican side, and near Michael Umana are the left side Junior Díaz, with 48 presences and the owner Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five went over the 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least.
Those who have less. With more than 30 presentations in Spain include Gerard Picé (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 presences, Roy Miller appeared with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest of it doesn't even happen at 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Victor Bolivar has only one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson are not yet starting.
The historic bottle of Spain is David Villa, with 50 flies, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one that records the most, with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country in its turn to celebrate two decades of trajectory
\"Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has become reality.\"
In the exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament from Pearl Jam said the group is ready to offer one of his best concerts next Sunday on the National Stadium.
They have waited for more than 20 years, but the group ensures that for them it will also be a dream become a reality to happen in this country.
The bassist and founding member Jeff Ament ensured, speaking exclusively to Viva, Brazil, last week.
The group is located in the South American wing of its two-day work-decade celebration tour and on Sunday 20 will make its only stopover in Central America.
That day will be on the National Stadium, from 19:30 a.m., next to the Los Angeles The X group and the Las Robertas nationals.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, the complete transcript of which is found in La Nación on the Internet.
For his Costa Rican followers, the fact that Pearl Jam will take place in Costa Rica is a dream come true. Are you aware of what your fans live for?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has come true for us too.
This is our second time in South and Central America, and so far it has been great.
I went to Costa Rica only once on vacation; it's such a beautiful country and I think we can spend a few days there.
So we're excited to bring our music there.
I ask you, because there is a kind of devotion to the group, fans live intensely on the previous days.
What is your message for your most fervent followers?
Thank you for staying with us all these years.
It took 21 years for us to arrive in Costa Rica; thanks for waiting so long and we are sorry that so much time had to pass until this concert.
Some people already say that his concert is the biggest show of the year.
Does this add a little pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've had for the last 21 years have been held in the last two weeks.
We offered a couple of giant shows to Sao Paolo and we hope that this set us up for this concert in Costa Rica.
We are really looking forward to producing ourselves.
We love this country, we like surfing and jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you discover Costa Rica and its surf waves?
We have a lot of friends surfers and I have a very good friend who lives in Tamarindo and waves are amazing there.
My friends were always going to surf in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, next to Mexico, are great places to surf; that is how we learned it, through people who love surfing.
When you saw the tour, you offered huge shows, with lots of songs.
What did you plan for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we have never produced there, we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to do the best show possible, with a wide variety of songs; we will try to interpret two songs from each album and offer our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the directory.
What's that got to do with it?
I think it's partially because we have nine discs and we can interpret more than 120 songs and everyone loves different songs, that's why it's very difficult to choose which songs to interpret each evening.
When we have two or three songs in the directory that we have not interpreted for a long time, this helps us to stay focused and surprise us because it reminds us why we love these songs and that we may have forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it becomes even more interesting for people.
With this tour, you celebrate 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you've done?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I think that none of us imagined that we were going to form a great rock group, and the fact that we did it for more than 20 years makes it sound like a dream.
We continue to share our blessings and the fact that we are able to continue to make music together makes us very excited.
We love each other and love to create music.
We're lucky to go to places in the world we've always wanted to go to.
Things couldn't go any better for us.
What does it mean to you to have been a fundamental element in the creation of the grunge?
It has always been an honour for us to be part of this group of major groups.
We are very friendly with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is uncommon.
From time to time, a group emerged from a city, but it is much more strange when five or ten groups come out at the same time from the same city.
We are proud and it is an honor for us to be part of the Seattle Group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we participated in a festival with Alice in Chains and we went to Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on their tour, so we are lucky to still be friends with all of them and it is an honor for us to be part of this Seattle sound that emerged.
It is also very strange that a group like yours stays united and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us were together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and only that is much longer than many groups normally last.
Firstly, I believe that we are all lucky to be still alive and, secondly, we are all concerned about others.
We are all intimate friends and thanks to this there are musical boulevards that give freedom to each one to experience.
We have confidence in each other with each other's music and it could not go better.
Your relationship with the famous word was not easy; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do what you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we grew up, it was easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure that we don't spend too much time on tour because it's easy to fall into this game of great crowds and people who love your music.
If we don't forget that people are here for music, it helps us not to forget that we must respect the music and what brought it, without putting ourselves in the forefront of the fact that we are famous and a rock star, which doesn't really interest any of us.
How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote good songs and at first it was great.
We were a group for almost three years and did not publish a record before the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
There have been many frustrations for the fact that she has lasted so little and most importantly is the fact that we are still very friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the group with us and when I listen to a song or I see a picture I think of the amazing person that Andy has been and how he made me laugh, it has always been a pleasure to work, laugh, talk about music, football and many other things with him.
He was a surprising human being and we miss him.
The Las Robertas national group will open the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know his work, especially Eddie Vedder and that's why you chose him for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos with different proposals and that was the group we loved the most, so we look forward to seeing what Las Robertas can offer live and it must be very distracting.
What do you always change the words of Yello Ledbetter live for?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He's the one who sings it and I think he does it with the first words he imagines.
As a bassist, what are his influences?
There's so much...
Among the first I remember is Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many influences that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I love.
How did Pearl Jam keep the grunge relevant despite the fact that it is no longer fashionable?
I think we all feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the groups that I have just mentioned, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those who have emerged at the same time and, if this is relevant now, I think it is wonderful, because it is a music worth listening and groups like Mudhoney now make the best music that ever.
At first, his music had a more obscure content and now it has become more positive.
What does that change have to do with?
It's interesting, because I think there are songs in the new album that seem lighter, but there are also songs, such as The End or Just Breathe qualify as very obscure songs, even though they can sound a little positive.
With both of them, when Ed played them for me, I cried when I listened to them and they were deeply obscure songs.
I think if you grow up and there's a trauma in your life and you lose a relative or a friend, these things start to influence your art and your music and those songs, probably represent it to me.
I also think that we can also be happy and even so we can do dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori hospitalized again for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized on Tuesday in a public hospital to be evaluated for the loss of muscle strength in his feet, informed his family doctor.
Fujimori, 72, who is serving a prison sentence of 25 years for human rights violations committed during his Government (1990-2000) suffers from various conditions, including language cancer for which he was operated four times and is under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, his personal physician, said for Canal N television that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Naoplasic Diseases to determine the reason for pain and loss of strength in its lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate for the benefit of retribution for humanitarian reasons, he probably said that he did not want it because he felt innocent.
It has been performed four times of tongue cancer, it has a weight loss of 18 kg, and other pathologies, such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreatic cyst, kidney calculations, arterial hypertension and walking problems, listed the doctor.
Fujimori has been in prison since September 2007 in the National Directorate of Special Police Operations.
In April 2009 he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people because of an army annihilation squadron that operated clandestinely during the first years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to consolidate political ties
An official court, headed by Uruguayan President José Mujica and made up of various ministers and patrons, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two nations and to address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with its Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of a long meeting schedule with the political, commercial and a meeting with the resident Uruguayan community in Mexico, according to the agenda broadcast by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will be - appropriate for the exchange of information in political affairs between the two nations - according to the information published by the Presidency of the South American country on its website.
According to local media, Mujica seeks to convince Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France that took place when the French representative, Nicolas Sarkozy, included the South American country on the list of tax havens, in the meeting of the G20 in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community countries that continue to be tax havens, a statement that caused the rejection of Uruguay and the call for consultations of its ambassador to that European country.
Since November, Mexico has been chairing the G20, a group of the world's strongest emerging and developed countries, and has been in force with the South American country since January this year, a convention to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan Government has tried the past few years to make the tax exchange agreements more effective to emerge from the “grey list” of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), integrated by countries that do not implement all international tax cooperation standards.
At the commercial level, Mexico and Uruguay have had a Free Trade Treaty (TAC) in force since 2004, which has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The moustachus plumber passes to the three dimensions with \"Super Mario 3D Land\"
Super Mario struggled, tireless, for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the wicked Bowser's grips, but he had never done it in three dimensions: in \"Super Mario 3D Land - he will fight for the love of the young man in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which happens this month at stores around the world, has been designed from the beginning to make good use of the features of Nintendo 3DS mobile console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without using glasses.
“Mario is the character who has to say how the spectacleless stereoscopy should work,” said Nintendo’s specialist press manager in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez said that \"Super Mario 3D Land - is the first Nintendo video game originally designed for this support - because so far success such as \"Star Fox 64 3D - or -Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D - was an adaptation of the existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesperson argued that, despite being in 3D, \"Super Mario 3D Land\" is a video game that allows a fast and fluid part.
Álvarez said that \"Super Mario 3D Land\" contains two games in one: the first part is \"simple\" to hold down the less skilled users.
Once overcrowded, the most experts will be able to make a \"second round\" at the playing levels, which this time are more difficult.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an aggressive \"D\" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it would be necessary to play in three dimensions in order to overcome the different challenges and - to succumb to optical illusions -
This three-dimensional Super Mario raid also involves the return of the character to a mobile console, which has not been happening since 2005.
In these video games Nintendo has turned a blind eye to saga followers and repeats the formula of success of the previous games, which consists in the fact that the moustacho plumber must go through endangered platforms to free Princess Peach.
Even though my player finds new things in movements, environments, costumes and enemies as well as in the case of Luigi - jouable -
Colom endorses Portillo's extradition to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced last Tuesday that he had ordered the extradition of former Governor Alfonso Portillo to respond to the United States for the conspiracy for the laundering of US$70 million.
This concludes the trial for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country calling for Portillo to judge it.
At the press conference, Colom stated that his decision was in accordance with the independence of the judiciary and the executive, taking into account the fact that a court of first instance had already ordered his extradition.
He stated that during his term of office he had not helped in any judicial resolution and had given course to all the extraditions he had experienced.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will also be extradited for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes will be extradited for drug trafficking.
What Colom did involves an executive action after having exhausted all the judicial and constitutional bodies to judge the former agent of the 2004-2004 interval.
According to the resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Tribunal and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo should be extradited after having resolved its legal situation in Guatemala and having guaranteed its human rights.
Portillo was absolute for the diversion of Q120 million funds to the Ministry of Defence when he was president, which was the trial that preceded the extradition, but the Public Ministry appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people in risk situations
The entity was born to avoid marginalization of young people without training
The balance of the first 25 years of life of the Trinijove social support entity is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have received help to overcome a difficult situation during this quarter of the century.
In addition to this, it is the long-synthesis of current work positions achieved by this social group.
The anniversary served yesterday to take stock in an event celebrated in a former industrial complex of Fabra i Coats, to which more than 300 people attended.
Trinijove was born in the Trinitat Vella district in 1986 with the aim of helping the untrained, jobless people with problems of drug addiction or marginalization.
The celebration of yesterday in Sant Andreu has concentrated a large number of officials of entities and institutions who in these 25 years have collaborated with the association.
The varied political representation, in the electoral season, showed the unitary nature of the work done by Trinijove.
In addition to the President of the Catalan Regional Government (Generalitat), Artur Mas and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the former Minister of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragall and the former deputy mayor and current municipal councillor Richard Goma attended the act.
The current Minister of Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries and the Director General of Charity of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, were also attended in the large room of Fabra i Coats.
But he claimed that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that the present one is also, but he added that the work done so far - is a good basis -
The president gave Trinijove as an example to know how to fight bad circumstances and to give hope to people in difficulty.
\"The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does,\" he said.
Property invaded by squatters for micro-feasts, evacuated
The invaders were suitable for 11 of the 13 apartments of the building, in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants left the property at noon yesterday without any resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that the residents of number 51 Balmes Street lived ended.
Twelve people voluntarily abandoned the building they were illegally occupied at noon yesterday, where they organized micro-feasts that were desperate for neighbors, in judicial order and without the need for police intervention.
At the end of the operation, the lock of the door was changed to prevent the situation from recurring.
-From this day on there will be a control of access - the administrator affirmed.
The squatters, who had invaded 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the rest were inhabited - took the electrical installation and part of the water, apart from painting the walls and leaving residues of all kinds, especially alcoholic beverages.
The first three apartments were the stage of mass parties, which would last up to two days and despair tenants.
Next to the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which has also been affected.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europe Press that as soon as the building was occupied, her case fell by 80%.
The owner of the club mentioned that the property's invaders gave him unfair jurisdiction, as they sold the glasses at three euros, while in the discotheque they were worth 10.
In addition, the owners of the leisure resort had to respond to the complaints of the neighbors about noise, while, according to the latter, the trouble was not caused by the club's clients, but by the residents of the house occupied and especially the participants at the parties held there, which were more frequent and intense in recent weeks, according to the irritable neighbours of the area.
The head of the disco explained that the trouble was so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the building and it has been nine months since he - he's forgiven him - rent it.
The Guardia Urbana (municipal police) also confirmed that in recent weeks they had received more complaints from neighbours about this situation.
Mayor Alberto Fernández Díaz, president of the municipal PP group, had asked last week - the immediate evacuation of the building to end the problems of living in common and civic life that it caused the residents and the degradation of the area -
The popular leader explained that before summer only one floor of the building was occupied, but in recent months the squatters had occupied all floors of the building and almost all the apartments and that in some apartments there were flights as well.
It is in this sense that he added that -you must end impunity and be ruthless against antisocial behaviour generated in property -
Also yesterday, the Mossos (the local Catalan police) evacuated a building in Nou Barris.
At 3.30 p.m., the police moved to Rue Mont-ral's 35th Street, after receiving the call from a neighbor who had observed four people accessing the building.
The four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
Architects coincide on the opportunity of convening beyond the controversy over fees
The municipal competition on the 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, in the middle of the already-extended Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration has printed Collserola promotional posters.
The brochure defined the mountain as the big park of metropolitan Barcelona.
In addition, it also contained a comparison, in figures, with the Central Park of New York.
With the death of the CMB in 1987, the park became once again, in the imagination of many people, the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital being the only one that does not focus on the north-south axis, if not high (mountain) - low (sea).
Collserola's qualification as a natural park is to the advantage of this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park if not Yellowstone, with bunnies in the role of Yogi bear.
This was the situation until, in September, the city hall called for a mega-competition composed of 16 competitions for all the doors of access to Collserola.
A door restores the idea of the park, no doubt.
That's it, or someone wants to put doors in the field.
The question appeared alone: Collserola: park or mountain?
The competition, both with regard to its organization and with regard to the reflection on the city, is a topic of conversation of all the architects of Barcelona.
It is almost a recurring theme that two members of this former elite caste speak when they recognize themselves in an elevator.
And this is just one of the few opinions on which three Barcelona architects, university professors, coincided.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the contest is timely.
For Roldán, after approaching the littoral front, it is necessary - to debate the mountain front - because the speech of Ildefons Cerda, the speech of the green-house pastries has not been completed.
\"It is necessary to leave from the base that the longest park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things for its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex - it has given the verdict the architect for which the title of \"Collserola ports\" contains a \"lexical tree\": it is not necessary to think of them - as the access to a park, but the delimitation of certain areas in which it is necessary to act -
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urbanistic world, qualifies the proposal as \"intellectual challenge\" with \"some dangers\"
Risks arising from the “uncertainty of the projection of public space” after the experience experienced in the 1980s and which took place in the Forum area - its swan song -
The first fear is the own delimitation of the boundaries on which we can build.
‘Limiting something means already establishing the next step — that is, exceeding it.
\"New urban planning instruments must be thought of, as the current [regarding the Metropolitan General Plan (MPG)] can cause genuine disasters\"
Taking more into account the question, Modol believes that, by simplifying, the slope of the region El Valles de Collserola - may be heard as a park, that of Barcelona, no -
Modol recalls that there is already a work done by the Patronat de Collserola that should not be lost - thanking for the opportunity that the mayor offers to his corporation to intervene in this project - at the first moment -
In addition, he believes that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the except-conduct that allows the architects to enter the debate, but - it should - if this technical profile should lead the multidisciplinary teams - all a success - he says) that we have to create: - We architects should be only an instrument -
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question giving the title of this piece is complex, because the bases of the competition he lacks an overall vision of Collserola: \"We have summoned 16 cross-sectional contests - he says - in the mountain-sea sense, but there is no longitudinal reading that leads and includes the area as a whole -
This, at least in this case, has opted to participate in the 16 competitions.
In another way, a project to allow one of the doors to clash in the program and definition with that of the architect of the neighboring door.
In his opinion, yes, the mayor's office should ensure that the band immediately superior to Ronda de Dalt's should provide, in full extension, an area of equipment that makes a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal and it will be released
After 72 days of provisional arrest, Casino Red's legal authority granted forgiveness to the Mayor of Monterrey's brother for the trial initiated against him for alleged blackmails
After 72 years of arrest, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the foundation of the legal power of the Casino Red grants him forgiveness before the Second Criminal Court of the District, which follows a trial for blackmail against the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey.
After the attack of the Casino Royale, the owner of the Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jonás allegedly demanded the payment of an economic quota for the Mayor of Monterrey to allow the clandestine operation of the gambling house.
After the public denunciation, the Prosecutor opened a criminal trial against the brother of the Mayor Panist and on 2 September he was arrested and held in provisional detention for 30 days.
After four hours before the Agent of the Public Ministry 3 of Heritage Crimes, he was transferred to the Detention Centre 1, located in the Old Quarter of the State capital.
He remained there for the next 49 days when a second arrest warrant was issued to him after the Public Prosecutor's Office arrested the corruption and organized crime offences.
On October 19, he was transferred to Cadereyta's penal center presumably for having had one and a half million pesos sing the owners of the Casino Red; but he spent only a few hours in the medium-security detention center because there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the trial in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On 25 October, an arrest warrant was issued by the Registrar of the Second Criminal Court of the District, Jorge Yánez, who said that after almost two months of investigation there was sufficient evidence to determine Jonás' guilt, such as that relating to the 1.5 million weights of the game house representatives in exchange for its operation.
This Monday, the foundation of the legal power of the Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, appeared before Judge José Luis Pecina to seek forgiveness for the brother of the mayor of the region; therefore he could regain his freedom during the following hours.
During the legal formalities, the Public Prosecutor's Officer attached to the Tribunal, Ramiro Arias, questioned García Gómez if the damage had been recovered and who was the one who had granted the pardon, but the lawyer tried not to communicate the name.
Under file 197/2011, legal forgiveness is granted to Jonás Larrazábal and subsequently no claims relating to the trial brought against him may be filed; no damages and no punishment shall be sought from him.
After the hearing of the foundation of the legal power of the gambling house, at 15:50 hours the immediate freedom of Larrazabal Breton was ordered.
The Registrar of the Tribunal, Jorge Yánez, moved to the San Nicolás de los Garza municipality prison to inform Jonás that he had been legally forgiven and his file would be classified.
He will also communicate to her the immediate order of liberty issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionysio Pérez Jácome informs the details of the air accident in which he lost his life the Secretary of the Government, Francisco Blake and seven other persons
The Communications and Transport Secretariat (CTS) reported that the results highlighted the accident in which the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora and seven other persons lost his life, indicate that the helicopter directly clashed against the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionysio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before the aircraft took off, the pilot found that the climate conditions were adequate to fly.
\"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit has had various contacts with the ground, the blades have had contact with the trees at 25 meters where the unit has lost the fuselage\"
He also informed that the unit was designed for 19 people, so the unit met the requirements for the transportation of personnel.
In addition, he said that investigations conducted in the impact zone did not report the appearance of soil parts.
In one research, it was reported that there are no parts or components of the aircraft in another location, the impact was structurally presented.
The helicopter was designed for 19 passengers and met the requirements for transporting them.
The ground had a slope of seven to 30 degrees.
For the time being, the secretary assured that a priority is to have the results as soon as possible; but the investigation can last a few months, it can even last a year.
In turn, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Aéroports and Services Auxiliaires, assured that the moment of impact, the helicopter of the State Majeur Presidenteel operated at the speed of crunching and it happened on a moving rising ground.
‘This information supports the assumption of a normal operation crunching at the time of impact,’ he says.
During the press conference, the TBS holder, Pérez Jácome, listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual Voltage:
According to the aeronautical regulations, the flight was carried out according to the rules of the visual flight, which implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The reports in the AICM mentioned adequate conditions for take-off, and as the aircraft advanced to the border area between DF and the State of Mexico there were layers of low-level nebulae.
Selected routes:
It is likely that because of the conditions of nebulae the crew has sought a lower height area and more visibility towards the valley of Cuernavaca.
Location of impact.
The coordinates of the impact and the last record of the aircraft on the radar coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration of the flight path.
Dispersion of aircraft remains in a reduced area:
The information available so far suggests that the impact has taken place on a straight and side path.
The aircraft remains scattering model suggests that the helicopter struck against the ground under structural integrity conditions.
No traces of fire or explosion were detected:
In the disaster area there is always no trace in the remains of the aircraft of a type of explosion or fire.
The latest survey results indicate that the aircraft had had multiple ground contacts.
During the ground work, parts of the aircraft were found at a height of 9 thousand 200 feet above the average sea level, and the ground presented a slope that ranged from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which he may have disarticulated along his journey.
The information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts on the ground.
After careful research into a larger area than the surrounding area, around the accident, there were no scattered parts of the aircraft, which supports the presumption that the impact took place under conditions of structural integrity.
MSS announces protocol to find the genes of obesity
Social Assurance leads an investigation to discover the genes of obesity in the case of children and young people; this is supported by experts from the IPN
The Mexican Institute of Social Insurance (IMSS) announced that it is conducting an investigation to discover the genes of obesity in the case of children and young people, called the 'Genetics of obesity of children and adolescents' protocol that will allow to have the markers associated with overweight.
In a press release, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry of the Hospital des Specialités du Centre Médical National du 20e Sècle, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been formed.
This team is supported by specialists and graduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Advanced Research and Study Centre (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
In the investigation, it is invited to participate in the population with or without the right, to attend the participating sports units of IMSS in Valle de México, where evidence is given to minors every Saturday from 8:00 a.m.
He stressed that the protocol began in the Kuauhtémoc Sport Unit (State of Mexico Poniente) and that from 8 October, the activity takes place in the Sports Unit of Nezahualcoyolt (State of Mexico Orient).
After reaching the goal of bringing 500 or 600 minors together, the study will continue in the Sports Independence Unit (south of Federal District) and finally in the Sports Unit Morelos (north of Federal District).
He explained that the objective of this investigation and that it is aware of the components and importance of genetics with regard to the development of obesity and to identify risk factors among Mexican children and young people in order to prevent the occurrence of chronic degenerative diseases.
As the World Diabetes Day will be celebrated on 14 November, he mentioned that the goal is to bring together three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the application of specific food-related questionnaires.
They will also be asked about their physical activity and history of family inheritance of their diseases, to avoid risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or kidney failure.
It was detailed that Saturdays will be applied to all participants in anthropometric measurements (weight, size, circumference of size), blood pressure, determination of glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetics (it is sought to identify people associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz López pointed out that this investigation is the result of the health professionals' concern about weight gain in the case of minors.
'The 1999 and 2006 health surveys reported that in just six years there has been a rise in the case of boys, 77 per cent in obesity and 47 per cent in girls; in the case of overweight, there has also been a dramatic increase', the IMSS specialist stressed.
He indicated that the rationale for finding markers is based on the fact that the population of the country is different from others from its genetic history.
He informed that, on average, Mexicans have 65 per cent indo-American heritage, 30 per cent in Europe and five per cent in Africa, and this condition is reflected in people associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity translate into the inability to burn the excess energy that is consumed (calories), which is deposited in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit to participants is the full assessment of children, which allows them to detect whether they have a degree of overweight or obesity.
He even said that the presence of dark-colored pips (acanthosis) on the neck and forearms indicate the probability of suffering from metabolic and even prediabetic alterations.
The information is managed in a confidential way, doctors hand it in writing to parents, to whom it is explained each of the measures and changes in the lifestyle that they have to make in order to prevent disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentaryness, which is the lack of daily physical activity, stay most of the day sitting in front of the TV and use means of transportation instead of walking on short distances.
Another cause is the high caloric intake, i.e. the largest consumption of sugar drinks, carbohydrates (tamals - pasta from cornmeal wrapped in corn leaves -, bread, pizza, burgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and the genetic analyzed in this protocol.
UNAM's asphalt would avoid cashews
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the UNAM Faculty of Chemistry, develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with better performance, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signals that the pavement was resolved, it would no longer be necessary to repair approximately 200 thousand cases every rainy season in the Metropolitan Area of Valle de México, alert Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of UNAM, which ensured that if the process of construction and maintenance of the bitumen pavement is adequate, the cases could be completely reduced or even eliminated.
During his conference A technological opinion on cassis, organized as part of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory responsible for developing modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with similar characteristics to those of asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera felt that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve performance, and therefore the formation of cashews.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, molecules with a heavier molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and molecules with a low molecular weight, called malthenes, which together give the paving its characteristic viscoelastic behaviour.
The viscoelastic behavior of the asphalt consists of the fact that at high temperatures, almost 180 degrees, it behaves as a liquid, at 120 degrees C its viscosity is very large and at 50 degrees C it has a very strong state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes breaking, it added.
This means that in the streets the asphalt resistance is not uniform and changes during the day according to environmental conditions and temperature, warns the chemical engineering specialist.
The FQ researcher observed that the majority of the streets of Mexico City were covered by a flexible pavement consisting of six layers of materials, the last three of which involve asphalt.
Among the more superficial layers is the asphalt layer, formed by small stones bathed in asphalt and subsequently compacted.
Each of the small stones that forms the layer, he reported, is bathed in asphalt.
When vehicles go through it by generating efforts, it allows the forces to spread very well in the pavement.
If we had modified asphalt, they would spread better, opined the chemical engineer.
On the asphalt layer, he said, one last layer is put called the rolling layer, made of fine stone, that is, of sand which is also bathed in asphalt.
As this is the layer in contact with the wheels of the vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt layer and provide adherence on the street.
Being the part of the pavement that receives and distributes efforts, the rolling stock also requires that it has an adequate thickness and the material it is made must be treated.
The climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, is also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he says, because they significantly affect the performance of the asphalt layer.
When the soil is wet, the water spreads inside the layer is difficult for it to sort, which softens all layers of the pavement and therefore causes the cassava.
In the process of formation of a case, he said, the first one that gets frustrated is the rolling film and only later is affected the layer of asphalt, but the damage does not take place immediately, but it is a process that must be treated to the first signals with adequate maintenance programs.
The member of the National Investigator System explained that the load of vehicles is another important factor for the formation of cassis and therefore the thickness of each layer of the pavement must always be linked to the load of vehicles and ensure its satisfaction, in order to avoid frequent formation of cashews.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still a lot to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, bituminous emulsions, which in other countries already exist on the market and allow to repair the cassis easily and without having to use high temperatures.
What did the candidate in Valle miss to be the new miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that made Melina Ramírez Serna not obtain the crown of Miss Colombia.
Valle receives her title number 14 as a princess.
Again Valle del Cauca remained with the desire to win the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to be content with being on the winning podium, wearing the silver crown and the band that accredited her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantic went up with the crown and the sceptre, the department already sums up 14 titles of Princess and Melina joins a legion of women from Valle del Cauca who found themselves near the crown but were proclaimed princesses, including Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Monica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garces Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
Today the big question that many people ask is:
What did he miss? Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite that in each presentation demonstrated that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, because she had not been elected in vain Queen of Police and Best Vision Jolie de Vogue, titles obtained by the Queens Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor considered key in the decision taken by the jury to designate her First Princess is the fact that she did not believe in her answer to the question -?What was the book that marked you and why? asked by Martín Murillo Gómez, of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
This is the response of the Valle candidate to this question:
\"I read a lot, I believe enough in literature, I believe it is a way of culturalizing, I definitely believe that the book that marked my childhood is \"The Little Prince\" is a rather profound book.
Now I read \"Crime and Châtiment\" is a book of universal literature that we should all read; and now I read the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a very beautiful book called \"The Garden of Blood.\"
This answer did not please first because of the term \"culturalize\" and secondly not to explain concretely how each book cited it had marked it.
But at the end of the Melina ceremony she said that she felt calm and happy with the result - the universe and wise, it happens what must happen.
And for everyone, please read a little, \"The little prince is a great book\"
Among the assumptions made is that Valle was destroyed by favouritism.
A journalist from Bogota suggested that being the favorite, the ovationnée and the candidate who received all the preliminary awards (the challenge of Oster gastronomy, the public's vote for the best artisanal costume, and Queen Mother),-this aroused the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and that is why she did not shine on the scene-
And this was noted in his first swimsuit presentation at the Hilton beach and his two parades on the eve of the crowning.
Although at the two parades it had appeared certain of itself, it was noted that it did not have the strength and energy of the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantic.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the program \"As at home\" (As at home), from the RCN Canal, said that Melina had been appointed a princess - confirms that the candidate who gets most of the prizes during the competition does not receive the crown of queens -
In addition, Valle avoided the press at the end, and that was a mistake.
Another assumption is that Valle has not been able to convince the jury of its interest in social initiatives, which is in fact the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
That is why two days before the election the international jury Lucy Doughty stated that they were looking for a woman engaged in the social needs of her country.
\"Only beauty is not enough in a Miss Colombia, it is necessary to look beyond physics and focus on its social sensibility, that before starting the Competition they are already involved in projects,\" she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle has sinned because of her faults behind her and the fibrosis that was observed in her abdomen, but this is contradictory, because precisely the jury elected her as the candidate 'Natural Beauty' with the healthier body, good food and responsible physical work.
The queen preparer Jorge Hernán Orozco recognized that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better ones, but her problem of fibrosis on the abdomen, which in fact had not been too notorious for me, left him points on the last day -
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos, of the magazine Cromos considers that the mistake of the Valle candidate was the surgical interventions she had undergone.
\"Surgeries are good, but Valle didn't know how to do them.
His body has never been his asset and she has lost because of this aspect -
For this award, which the National Beauty Competition gives for the first time, after the swimsuit parade emerged a cruel prediction that took place last night, it was said that it was a small gift Raymundo made to Melina not to give her the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina begins today a year of reign, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international contests by designation of the National Competition.
However, she will pass through history as one of the queens who, despite her stunning passage through Cartagena, did not get the crown.
Thus was the work of the person of Cali who identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano
A Cali dactyloscopeist went to history as the man who confirmed the death of \"Alfonso Cano\".
The work of these staff members is crucial.
Last November 4th, a CTI Dactyloscopeist from Cali passed to history as the person who confirmed the identity of the Supreme Chief of the Farc: \"Alfonso Cano\" by confronting his fingerprints.
Of the seven dactyloscopeists working at the ITC's local offices, this week it was Eliazar González's \"availability tour\", a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working for 21 years in the field of judicial investigation.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the municipalities of Chocó, where many times he had to spend more than five days in the forest to get to the place where the corpses were to be identified.
The year 2000 he was transferred to the capital of Valle and after having followed adequate courses, he specialized in dactyloscopy, which is the study of the skin of friction, i.e. the palms and feet.
During the week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was advised to take clothes with him for at least three days.
Something very big was waiting for him.
On Friday night he left for Cauca in a Palmira helicopter.
He knew that he had to identify two corpses and that one of them was suspected to be the man who was leading the world's oldest guerrilla, so he was asked to take the card with the ten fingerprints of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
But when he arrived with the investigation team at the dead body, he did not recognize him by his physical appearance, because he was very different from the one he had seen in the media.
He did not have a beard, he was dressed like a peasant in the area, without glasses and much thinner.
But the prints don't lie.
Accompanied by a galtian wolf, ink, a foreman and a lantern, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse with those of the card.
His eye did not deceive him: it was \"Alfonso Cano\"
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was the man who confirmed to the Minister of Defence, Juan Carlos Pinzón that yes, he was the Supreme Chief of the Farc.
Searching for the fingerprint
For a Dactyloscopeist from Sijín de Cali, the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos has made to Eliazar González in a press conference for the operation against -Cano - is very significant.
A lot of people don't know about our work.
Dactyloscopy is an accurate science, without margin of error, which can be crucial in the resolution of crimes.
In addition to identifying the corpses, the dactyloscopeists support investigations for crimes such as theft and homicide and confirm the identity of the captured persons.
When captured, many offenders present false identity cards or do not have documents.
We take their fingerprints and search the database.
The researcher reported that in a case of theft he had to remove a piece of wall from a house, because in this place the thief had held his hand to bring out a safe full of jewelry and money.
\"The walls are difficult because they are not adequate surfaces to draw a fingerprint, but in this case we were able to get the fingerprint of the whole hand and identify the offender who had participated in different flights - he remembers.
The fingerprints may also remove or confirm suspects in cases of homicide.
Recently we found him a dead man, with bottles of drink around him.
Through the investigation, it was determined that a parent may be a suspect of the crime and that an imprint on the bottle coincided.
Even if it doesn't guarantee that he's the killer, it puts him on the crime scene.
A CTI Dactyloscopeist explained that digital fingerprints are extracted from objects with chemical or physical reagents -
When they appear, they are used by a breeder or band to take them.
Thereafter, fingerprints are sent to Asif, the declinent database, or to the National Civil Registry.
\"The problem is that there are still a lot of undocumented Colombians,\" said the expert from the ITC.
He explained that everything is not how we show it in the CSI television program.
As everything that shines is not gold, all that is touched does not become necessarily an imprint.
However, it can be used if the necessary confrontation is achieved.
The “indignified” defies the authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters flocked in front of Zuccotti Square to camp there.
A large part of the people have entered the evacuation order and have moved to a nearby park.
The members of the Occupy Wall Street movement challenged the New York authorities on Tuesday by trying to re-enter, thanks to a judicial order, instead of Manhattan, where they were evacuated at dawn and when they tried to occupy another park in the Great Apple.
Hundreds of protesters flocked in front of Zuccotti Square, where they wanted access through a judicial order that allowed 'indignant' to camp again in this place, while the other part of the movement responded to evacuation by occupying a park farther north of the city, where there were new stops.
\"Our idea is that if the court doesn't allow us to camp in place again, we'll settle in another place and continue the legal struggle to return to Zuccotti, and through sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations,\" says one of the spokespersons of the movement - Occupy Wall Street - Mark Bray.
Bray detailed that the 'indignated' response to the evacuation of their camp personally dictated by the Mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, came to the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting forced evacuation of the place and allowing protesters to stay in the camp.
In addition, the 'indignant' occupied a new park located at the confluence of Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which unites New York and New Jersey, owned by the Trinity Church parish.
At least for an hour they managed to take the place, but after the police moved there and arrested some protesters, even though Bray was unable to confirm the concrete figure, ensuring that he saw some journalists who had also been handcuffed.
The organization assures that there are hundreds of people who have settled in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders has moved in as a support to the members of the movement and has tried to intervene in favour of them before the police.
In the meantime, the Zuccotti Square - which is a private property building - remains closed pending the celebration of a judicial hearing scheduled for this Tuesday during which the legality of the evacuation of this morning must be analysed.
Some displaced demonstrators were carrying and distributing copies of this court order at that time and even delivering it to the officers who were watching the scene, which caused 'some small clashes', said Bray, who denounced the fact that some officials struck the protesters.
The court order prohibits the authorities from evacuating members of Occupy Wall Street or from applying 'loys published after the beginning of the occupation or prohibiting demonstrators from again accessing the park with tents or other properties they used before'.
Mayor Bloomberg pointed out to the press that, because of this judicial order, the city had suspended the reopening of space to the public and to the demonstrators, to whom he warned that local laws did not allow them to settle with tents and sleeping bags.
The municipal councillor personally defended the evacuation at dawn in place of Zuccotti, an operation during which 200 people were arrested and decided because the protesters were 'violating the law'.
Bloomberg explained that he had ordered the evacuation of the place because it became - a place where people did not come to protest, but to violate laws and in some cases, to harm other people - because certain stores had received threats - and the residents were afraid - for their quality of life -
\"This morning's evacuation was repugnant and demonstrates that Bloomberg is more interested in defending financial interests than American workers,\" added the movement spokesman, who accuses the mayor of not respecting freedom of expression.
The officials of \"Occupy Wall Street\" also indicated that they do not think to organize \"great actions\" for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and trade unions to commemorate the two months of protests, which began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special television program of Christmas
Apart from Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, she will be part of the TV program \"It's a Russell Peters Christmas - next December 1st
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in \"Home Improvement\" as a supporter in \"Baywatch\" in \"Playboy\" is the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special program of Canadian television Noel.
The CTV private television channel today announced that Anderson, next to the \"crooner\" (baladin) Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, will be part of the television program \"It's a Russell Peters Christmas - on December 1 interpreting a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images of the television program in which Anderson, also known for the wide Internet broadcast of a private pornographic video in which she appeared with her husband at that time, the drummer of \"Mötley Crüe - Tommy Lee, appeared dressed as the Virgin Mary by supporting in a creek a doll representing Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian Indian comedian who recently presented a part of “My Violent Torpedo of Truth” by Charlie Sheen, appeared like Joseph.
Next to Anderson and Peters, the CTV Noel special program also presents the Canadian singer Bublé, who in late March married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires, and who is not far from the controversy himself.
Recently, Bublé called the American Kim Kardashian 'pute' during one of his concerts in New York City.
Japan returned after the earthquake
GDP increases by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the spiral of decline in early March
Since March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, still convalescent after the devastating earthquake that has become a nuclear crisis, the country's worst disaster since World War II.
The Government of Tokyo's first estimates calculated material losses at $300,000 million, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, seems to have mitigated.
After three consecutive quarters of falls, data from the Gross Domestic Product between July and September were used to turn the page permanently: GDP increased 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% at annualized rates.
The second quarter - for Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - assumes, in addition, the highest rate of increase from January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly due to the resumption of acquisitions of equipment to restore areas devastated by the earthquake and tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1%, compared to the decrease of 0.9% in capital expenditures observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted increase.
However, the real stimulus of the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian impulse that invites you to take advantage of the crisis to consolidate - or rebuild - the infrastructure, use the shortcomings to grow zero.
Japan has mostly woken up through the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, driven by increased spending on vehicles, travel and entertainment activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has returned to the internal market when the yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the \"values refuges - elected by investors who flee the debt crisis in eurozone and the forecasts of the United States, a privilege that weighs like a badge in the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger division, products are more expensive abroad, a serious reverse for a country whose economic buoyancy line is determined by the health of major technological groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, have been responsible for their low results between July and September for Yen's contribution.
While markets continue to be based in EU peripheral countries, the Government of Yoshihiko Noda does not lower the guard.
\"The risks that persist, such as the deterioration of certain foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen, must be monitored,\" said the Secretary of State for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa yesterday.
And indeed, the prospects are not encouraging at all.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) noted that the majority of member countries submitted in September clearer signs of economic downturn.
The indicator that anticipates the inflection points of the world economy has highlighted that the main powers are constrained.
Because it dropped four decimal places up to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 points in August.
Eurozone was even below the average, which is at level 100, not lowering eight decimal places to 99.13 points.
Athens Relieves Doubts
Papadimos says the adjustments will be approved, but the Conservatives will not sign any written commitment
With the peripheral risk premiums triggered and the uncertainty reinstalled in the parks, Greece continues to get involved in the labyrinth which leads to the exit of the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the \"consensus\" of the new Hellenic Transitional Government is imposed rather by the Brussels requirements than by a real conviction of the political forces is beginning to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos pointed out yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the 100-day period established in his designation may be short to implement them, the leader of the Conservative New Democracy Party, Antonis Samaras, made sure that he was not going to support the new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his requirement for new elections for the expected date of February 19.
\"The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the 26 October summit,\" Papadimos said when he opened a parliamentary debate yesterday, which will end tomorrow with a vote of confidence for the new Executive.
A package of 24 programs to stimulate employment, reform of the civil servants' disciplinary code and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras' message does not reveal any doubts about his position: \"We are committed to helping the Transitional Government, but we have not committed ourselves to anything else.\"
The conservative leader went a step further into his pulse than the EU and IMF, the agencies that need to release the 8,000 million that Athens urgently needs, and made it clear that he will not approve any letter of commitment to the implementation of the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the impact caused by the whole of the referendum of Papandreu, yesterday reiterated that its requirement is firm: it will not unlock aid if the new government and leaders of the main Greek parties do not sign - a written commitment without ambiguity as soon as possible -
The spokesperson for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the Troika inspectors would return - very quickly - to Athens to discuss with the new Government - the elements needed to pay the sixth instalment - of 8,000 million, even if there is no final date either.
The Greeks still have much to do.
The Queen Sofia: -What are instruments for progress and hope -
The Queen underlines Spain's main place in this type of finance
Spain has reached a world-leading place in the role of Microfinances -
Queen Sofia recalled that in the past two decades the country has become the second donor of the planet in terms of this instrument of cooperation, of which - the essence - lies in the fact that it is an instrument for social progress, justice and hope in a better future for all mankind, based on trust in human beings -
Yesterday, the Queen inaugurated the fifth World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid, with the certainty that \"there is no doubt\" that such operations are \"absolutely indispensable\" to achieve the United Nations Millennium Goals for 2015, and, most notably, in the one aimed at reducing to half the volume of people living with incomes under one dollar per day, to which the poverty pool is established\"
Spain - continued to work - to expand the network of beneficiaries - in every corner of the planet, and takes up this task with \"responsibility\" - reported Queen Sofia, who hoped that the initiatives and inputs from the Summit, which will extend until Thursday, - would ensure the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially women - the main beneficiaries of these loans.
We have achieved many goals, and we face many challenges.
The Microcredit Summit is seen not only as a forum for debate, but also as the platform from which two basic goals must be promoted.
Thus, Her Majesty explained that the goal is that at the end of 2015 there are 175 million poor families who have access to these financial services and that one hundred million of these families are from the poverty line in which they now live.
The impulse in the design of microcredit in Spain and the rest of the world - followed the path initiated a few years ago in a pioneering way - by Muhammad Yunus, stressed Queen Sofia as an \"act of justice and recognition due -
And she described the father of this instrument as an admirable \"idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty \" , the work of which she has known for 15 years, when the Queen travelled to Bangladesh to know her lending policy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other events such as those celebrated in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and - at each meeting I was able to see a continuous evolution - explained Her Majesty, whose relationship with this project yesterday brought her the \"family head\" who met in Valladolid from the \"banker of the poor\"
Finally, Queen Sofia ended her intervention by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
\"Ethical imperative\"
The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that solidarity - it is an ethical imperative - for every democratic state.
In this regard, she stated that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries in times of economic prosperity, as it is a \"permanent obligation\"
Jiménez considered that microcredit involves a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to the eradication of poverty, and now - more than ever - the governments of developed countries must work under criteria of solidarity and not let it be the victim of compressions.
For Spain, microcredit is one of the main lines of development cooperation -
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded the success of \"giving confidence\" to those who \"excluded all to whom the door closes\" and the Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the people present in a city that opens its doors contaminated with the spirit of solidarity\"
The CDU proposes to elect the European President for universal suffrage
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Monday, 14 November, in Leipzig, took place without real difficulty for Angela Merkel, chancellor but also president of the Christian-Democrat party.
Europe's future was not originally planned for the programme, but was required in the fall, especially to satisfy the militants who feel that the government's policy is too lax for the Greeks today and perhaps for the Italians tomorrow.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the management, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The ovation stand-up of several minutes to which they were entitled, following their interventions, Angela Merkel then, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the very Europhilic Minister of Finance, left no room for doubt.
The idea-master of chancellorship - and the motion - is a slogan: the response to the crisis - is not less than Europe but more of Europe -
Not only because Europe is peace, but because - nine million jobs depend directly on the euro -
For chancellor, time has come from a breakthrough in Europe -
This could result in amendments to the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the control of the European Union over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, but this could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission to universal suffrage - in order to face Europe -
This is, in any case, one of the motions adopted by the Congress, whose inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
Of course, it is unlikely that the Twenty Septs will agree quickly on this revolution: Britain is hostile to it and the CDU leaders believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is also.
But the stallion is set.
Similarly, delegates rejected to an overwhelming majority the proposal to place the weight of each country on the European Central Bank's directorate, depending on the weight of each economy, which obviously increased the weight of Germany.
In order to reduce the climate within its party, the chancellor has increased the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she has not sought to win her congress on the back of the small - European countries or countries in difficulty soon to criticize Germany's arrogance.
If the motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of - Franco-German friendship - Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Except in the guts.
Remembering that two centuries ago, Leipzig had been at the heart of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What is disease arrest fraud?
After the allocations, both the UMP and the government launch the offensive on sick leave.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be on Tuesday 15 November in Bordeaux to visit a family allowance fund, and give a speech on the theme - recurrent since 2007 - of combating social fraud and assistance.
And to accompany this offensive, which starts from a willingness to make savings in a context of rigour, but is no less announcing an axis of the presidential campaign on the right, the majority want to focus on the disease arrests.
First of all, for the purpose of budget savings: the government plans to impose on private employees a fourth day of deficiency before taking care of a job stop.
Clearly, without specific business agreement, an employee who becomes ill would lose four days of salary, so at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that is likely to provoke anger, but which would make it possible to raise EUR 280 million, according to the Echos.
And that would be accompanied by another, more symbolic measure: to impose on officials a day of uncompensated deficiency in the event of a termination of employment (they have so far no shortage period, compared to three days in private).
While these issues are under discussion, the majority also revives the issue of fraud, this time targeting the abuses associated with the arrests.
“Controls will be much more important and, in addition, if you are taken, you will refund yourself” said Xavier Bertrand to the RTL micro on Sunday, November 13.
As in other cases, the advertising effects seem somewhat disproportionate to the reality of the frauds at work.
This has been the subject of constant political follow-up and offensives since 2002, which have most often borne fruit.
The French are not sicker than they are in Europe.
Let's wait first on the national figures.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (NAC), over €237 million of daily allowances were granted in 2006.
According to the Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Savings, the daily allowance in 2008 represented 5% of health expenditure, with 11.3 billion euros.
Of this amount, 46% related to maternity leave and accidents at work, and 54% related to sick leave, or EUR 6.2 billion.
And so 2.5% of health expenditures.
In 2010, the French averaged 14.5 working days, compared to 17.8 working days in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
An average that hides some differences: another survey, published in 2007 by the Career Management site Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed said they had not taken any day's sick leave.
Another study, this time of Health Insurance, states that in 2010, 37% of sick leave was of less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to one month, 15% from one to three months and 11% beyond.
When compared with their European neighbours, French employees are not more inclined than they are to stop work.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence rate (for health or non-health reasons) in France ranged between 10% and 11%, compared with 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Sick leave fraud is very low in the face of black work.
As far as fraud is concerned, it is only low in size.
Strengthening legislation since 2002 makes checks systematic on sick leave more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million controls, CNAM found that 13% of the 285,000 for short-term arrests were \"unjustified or too long\" or 37,050 cases.
In the case of stops of more than 45 days, systematically controlled, 11% of cases were “inadapted or unjustified” out of 1.2 million, or 132 000.
In total, therefore, 169 000 cases (unjustified) of several million employees who have had a sick leave.
A figure that represents very little face, for example, that of black work.
According to MPU Dominique Tian, the author of a report on this issue in June, it would amount to EUR 9 to EUR 15 billion of tax losses per year, i.e. more than the total cost of day-to-day allowances, and thus infinitely more than fraud against them.
Papadémos: Greece will have to implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment programme to restore its economy.
This is what the Prime Minister, Lucas Papadémos, said on Monday 14 November, before Parliament, adding that the hundred days given to his union government would not be enough to accomplish this task.
\"In order to continue the recovery efforts of the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme,\" said the Head of Government, who was speaking his first public address at the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the euro area summit on 27 October will be the \"principal task\" of the new government, as the country's participation in the euro area - is at stake - has been added.
As a result, Mr Papadémos predicted that the country's public deficit will be reduced by 9% of GDP by the end of the year, after being 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right refuses new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the right-wing leader, provided his support on Monday to the measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis but warned that his party would not commit to an additional austerity.
\"We will not vote for new measures,\" he said at a meeting with the members of his party, New Democracy.
He agreed with the objectives of reducing deficit and debt, and combating waste but hostile to any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
In Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not release the EUR 8 billion loan necessary without written assurance from all the parties that they would support the measures envisaged, Antonio Samaras replied that his word was sufficient and that he would sign nothing under external pressure.
It is necessary to legalize euthanasia and assisted suicide, says an expert committee
Canadians live in denial of death, according to the Royal Society of Canada report
In the area of palliative care, the Committee demands that governments, health care institutions, and doctors work together to ensure better palliative care, and that, beyond cancer cases.
Canadian society lives in denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to talk to their doctors about the conditions in which they want to die and make arrangements to do so.
This is one of the conclusions of an imposing report of the Royal Society of Canada, which involved six experts related to various areas, including ethics, law and medicine.
This committee recommends that the Government amend the Criminal Code in order to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, when this choice is required, to a patient deemed competent to make such a decision.
At the start of the game, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries on the planet.
If Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that -the medicalization of death in Canada has generated a culture in which people are afraid to address the subject of death -
Medication or non-medicalization, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, we are told by the experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the desire of most Canadians to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying in the hospital.
Overall, in Quebec, this rate is the highest, with 86% of the deaths occurring in the hospital.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that go against the federal government's position, which has already said they do not want to change anything to the Criminal Code on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to experts, who have also reviewed all countries where these approaches are legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization results in abuse in application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on non-competent or non-consenting persons.
On the contrary, he said yesterday in teleconference Jocelyn Downie, co-signatory of the report, that there would be more cases of these spills in the countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
\"Euthanasia is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.\"
“The assisted suicide is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal,” Jocelyn Downie explains.
Canadians in favor of euthanasia
Recall that 85% of Canadians have already expressed support for euthanasia because they believe that it would allow people at the end of their lives to alleviate their suffering, according to an Angus Reid survey conducted in 2010.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not have the effect of sending the message that the lives of older people or persons with disabilities are less valuable.
In the case of persons who committed assisted suicide, the respondents felt that 41% should not be prosecuted.
With regard to the maintenance or cessation of care for a patient, the situation is less clear, the authors of the report say.
Therefore, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest that it is indicated in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of care for which there has been a legally valid refusal is not criminal.
The Committee of Experts also requests that health professionals be trained in the duty to respect a denial of end-of-life care, without fear of criminal prosecution.
In the area of palliative care, the Committee demands that governments, health care institutions, and doctors work together to ensure better palliative care, and that, beyond cancer cases.
Finally, in terms of palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee requests that it be considered when it is not used to reduce physical pain, such as euthanasia, and that it be subject to the same procedures.
Reserves of other experts
Some experts in the field of health law have already issued reservations regarding the findings of the Royal Society of Canada's report of experts.
But Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, described as “extreme” the position of the experts who signed the report, among other things because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia to the terminally ill.
“This opens the door to a situation where everyone who would be tired of life and who would be more than 18 could ask for help to commit suicide,” said Deschamps, who had consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
Deschamps also stresses that the authors of the report seem to place the individual's autonomy above all other values that participate in the social fabric of society.
But, \"in society, he says, there are beacons and constraints\"
Health Law Specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed “a strong opposition” to the conclusions of the report, which she described as “pro-euthanasia”
Margaret Somerville, who herself is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, contests in particular the report's data on the absence of abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, either in the Netherlands or Oregon.
Jordan's King calls President Assad to leave power
Damas denounces a \"compound\"
Syria is increasingly isolated
Supporters from Bachar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday in front of the premises of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Diplomatic pressures intensified yesterday on the Syria of Bachar al-Assad, who, with the support of Russia, resisted them and denounced a \"combat\" against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union strengthened its sanctions against Damascus while Turkey and Jordan, neighbouring Syria, took a stand for the departure of President Assad.
Jordan's King Abdallah II was the first Arab leader to call President Bachar al-Assad to \"shout power\" in Syria where some 40 civilians and members of the regime's forces were still killed.
\"If Bachar was at the heart of his country's interest, he should resign, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life,\" said Jordan's neighbouring country of Syria in an interview with the BBC.
For his part, the head of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu deplored the failure of Turkish mediation efforts since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime.
\"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will leave,\" he said, referring to Syria, a neighbouring country in which Turkey adopts an increasingly harsh line.
The United States welcomed a \"strengthening of the consensus against Assad and the actions of the regime - Syrian, after the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
\"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, of countries like Turkey are adopting a tougher tone - in the face of repression in Syria, noted Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime's forces perished in the Deraa region in southern Syria, announced the Syrian Observatory on Human Rights (OSDH).
Two other civilians died from gunfights and looting to heavy machine guns in Jobar in the city of Homs, according to this NGO.
At a press conference, the Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem nevertheless felt that the country was \"leading towards the end of the crisis\"
He also strongly reacted to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus from its work, which is, according to him, a dangerous step.
Syria - it did not - it added, ensuring that -the deaf plots against Syria will fail -
Following its decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now studying a \"civil protection mechanism\" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
The French Minister for Foreign Affairs Alain Juppé also expressed support for the sending of United Nations observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime that he believes is locked in the “paranoia”
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled tomorrow in Rabat to review the implementation of the crisis exit plan decided on 2 November, including the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities facing the challenge and release of the arrested demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov judged the Arab League's decision yesterday, while China urged Syria to implement the exit plan, while maintaining its support for possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti asks for time in the markets and sacrifices to Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has called for some time in the markets to train his team and implement a program, which will contain - sacrifices - in order to recover the lost credibility in the last few months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner was in discussion with the political parties yesterday before today meeting the trade unions and employers.
It should set up a relatively small office consisting of technocrats outside Parliament.
\"Monti spoke of an important program with many sacrifices,\" said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many small parliamentary groups involved in the interviews, after meeting with the President of the designated Council.
The President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, has said that he expects Mario Monti to seek a vote of confidence in Parliament by Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultations will end with the presentation by Mr Monti of a limited list, probably of dozens of ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monti commented on the nervousness of stock markets and bond markets yesterday, asking for time.
In \"democracy, there are specific deadlines - to prepare a government and its program, he stressed, saying - certain that the markets will be patient and will understand -
Its appointment by the President was initially welcomed by the markets, but the concern resumed, particularly after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The designated Prime Minister should set up a team with a focus on technocrats, although he stressed that he would like to include \"politics\" in them.
The new government must last until 2013, the date of the next legislation, it has estimated.
According to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will gain the confidence of Parliament by Friday.
Mr Monti has committed himself, once he has been in office, to work in the urgency and for the purpose that Italy - becoming a leading player - in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that, even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change -
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its fiscal balance objective in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, has called for further measures of rigour.
The Italian boss Emma Marcegaglia, who will see him on Tuesday, also stressed the need to revive the economy, because a country that has no growth cannot respect the deficit parameters.
Mr Monti, renowned for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a \"change of time\" for Italy after 17 years of \"berlusconism\" - the \"teacher\" - symbolizing - the challenge of serious - and another Italy - according to the editorialists.
The great unknown will be the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy will have to place EUR 200 billion of state bonds by April 2012.
A Russian scientist assisted the Iranian nuclear programme
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, helped Iran develop a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, said on Monday an American NGO specializing in atomic risk.
The Institute for International Science and Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Safety Agency (IAEA) and other documents from this United Nations agency to identify this researcher.
The IAEA reported last week its \"serious concerns\" about a \"possible military dimension\" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to ISIS, which was widely available in IAEA documents, Danilenko, born in 1934, would have worked for three decades from the 1960s on a Soviet military nuclear centre in Tcheliabinsk, Ural, and would have been involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991 he left the centre to establish a company producing \"nano-diamants\" in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his society would have led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He would then have cooperated with the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its last report, the IAEA refers to - strong indications that the development by Iran - of a nuclear detonation system - has been assisted by the work of a foreign expert, who not only knew this technique, but who, as a Member State has informed the Agency, worked during the essential of his career on this technology within the military programme of his country of origin -
Anti-Muslim Crimes and Crimes increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims increased by nearly 50 per cent from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time, other racial and religious violence declined slightly or little, according to FBI statistics released on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of violence against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, 49 per cent, compared with a 13 per cent increase in violence against Catholics, a 4 per cent decrease in crimes against Jews, and an overall increase of 14 per cent in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of “crimes of hatred” has increased very slightly to 6,628 cases, including 47.3% motivated by differences in race and 20% by differences in religion, according to the FBI.
\"After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and crimes increase again,\" stressed the human rights organization First, \"the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant,\" added the organization in a communiqué.
\"Human Rights First has long emphasized that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be considered a serious violation of human rights,\" adds one of the officials of the organization, Paul Legendre.
\"The U.S. government can and needs to do more to tackle these abuses,\" he added, believing that this could lead to an improvement in police reports on \"crimes of hatred\"
The “crime of hatred” in U.S. federal law is a legacy of the time of the struggle for civic rights.
This legislation had been adopted after Martin Luther King's death to punish violence related to race, skin color, religion, origin and now sexual belonging.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The Twitter micro-blogging site introduced changes in the presentation of its platform on Monday to allow its users to observe the activity of the following, which makes its service a little more similar to that of Facebook.
A new tab - activity - and another - name - allows you to follow more legibly, live the activity of others - twittos - the netizens followed by the messages -tweets - and those who follow you.
This lets you know if they follow messages, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they have favorite messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested - on a small percentage of users in August - before being broadcast throughout the network on Monday, indicated to the AFP the spokesman for Twitter, Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known for its little instinctive operation, with somewhat esoteric terms (RT to redeploy a message from someone else, #followfriday to recommend to follow another user) making the initiated happiness, thus opening up to a wider audience with a more comparable handling than that of large Facebook and Google+ public networks.
On the network, users were discussing \"tweets\" based on the interest of this innovation.
\"It's useless, invasive, and it looks too much like Facebook,\" writes @jemb123.
“The Activity feature will help me better track some of the elements of my Twitter feed” sent @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Registration of a Golden Rule - Budget in the Constitution
The government of the great Social-Democratic/Democratic-Christian coalition in power in Austria decided on Tuesday to include in the constitution a \"gold rule\" in order to reduce public deficits and thus avoid a possible degradation by the rating agencies of the sovereign note of Austria (triple A).
It is the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who himself announced this decision at the end of a Council of Ministers, while the Austrian public debt is 74.6%, far above the 60%-maximum criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
\"If Austria's solvency was lowered only from a single skull, from AAA to AA+, we should pay EUR 3 billion more interest each year,\" argued Deputy Chancellor and Christian Democrat Minister of Foreign Affairs, Michael Spindelegger.
Austria is thus following a request from the euro area member countries in Brussels on 26 October: Heads of State and Government had then requested the inclusion by the end of 2012 of the reduction of public deficits and a return to balance of public accounts in the constitution or in a law of the same value.
The arrangements adopted by the Austrian Government are closer to the German model, Germany being the first European country to adopt such a rule.
By 2017, the structural public deficit will have to decrease annually by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) and, as of 2017, the structural public deficit of the federal state will not exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while regional states and municipalities will have to submit budgets to balance.
The objective is to move public debt to 2020/21 under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty.
Yen strong
Noda threatens a new intervention on the foreign exchange market
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would intervene again on the exchange market if the yen were to continue to rise.
\"We will intervene as we did last time if we notice excessive volatility - at the exchange rate of the yen, explained Mr. Noda in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen returned not far from the historical levels that prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo sold yen massively against dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency that had just established a new record of strength since 1945 in front of the green ticket.
But the yen has been regularly raised since, backed by purchases of investors who regard it as a \"value refuge\" in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar went back on Tuesday under the 77 yen and the euro fell under the symbol bar of the 105 yen, near the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Prior to the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was about 120 yen and the euro was over 160 yen.
This scourge of Japanese currency affects the exports of the archipelago because it has increased the cost of Made in Japan products and reduces the value of foreign revenues by Japanese firms when they convert them into national currency.
Japan struggles to rebuild itself since the earthquake and tsunami of 11 March, which devastated the region of the Tohoku (north-east), stressed Mr. Noda, who fears that this  yen increase will not kill the fragile recovery in the egg.
The third world economic power has renewed with growth in the third quarter - 1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter - for the first time in one year, thanks to a rebound of exports and consumption of the households that were lead by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister felt that the yen's dearest was not a reflection of Japan's economic fundamentals.
The Minister of Finance, Jun Azumi, called for the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Council on Tuesday to take all possible steps to weaken the yen.
But the deputy governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken the appropriate measures, suggesting that no additional monetary relief was to be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting in late October, the issuing institution increased its purchases of Treasury bills by EUR 5,000 billion (EUR 47 billion) totalling EUR 55,000 billion (EUR 519 billion) the ceiling on the amounts it spends on purchases of various financial securities to flood the liquidity market.
Euro Area:
The rates climb, the Stock Exchanges flank
The risk of contagion of the debt crisis still undermines European indices.
Despite the designation of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of fragile countries continue to rise.
Also concerned about the stability of the euro area, the European Stock Exchanges are a little deeper in negative territory on Tuesday, 15 November.
In Paris, at 10h, the CAC 40 loses 1.4% to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt is 0.4% and London 0.1%.
With the new tensions on the returns of euro-area borrowings in difficulty, equity markets around the world continue to make some of their recent gains.
- Investors, nervous, are only too aware of the risk of contagion - says Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters agency.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange has closed down by 0.7%, in turn suffering from the renewed fears of market participants about Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
Japan, like the rest of the world, has the eye on Europe and trade will continue in a corridor of narrow variations as long as investors have no evidence that the situation is stabilized, says Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This renewed concern over the future of the euro area penalises the single currency, which continues its decline on Tuesday.
The euro has been at its lowest level for a month and a half.
Around 10 a.m., the European currency is worth 1.3570 dollars, up from 0.4%.
According to the brokers, it withdrew after the chancellor party Angela Merkel, the CDU, meeting in congress Monday, adopted a motion, including the possibility for a country in difficulty to leave the euro area without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates well beyond 6%
The borrowing rates of Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
This Tuesday morning, the return of Italian bonds to 10 years is 6.85 per cent, that of Spanish titles of the same maturity 6.2%.
These tensions over the interest rates of the countries of the South, but also in France, continue to fuel the fears of the stakeholders.
The head of the future Italian government Mario Monti called for time in the markets to restore the situation in Italy, threatened with asphyxiation by the weight of his debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos stated that the implementation of the decisions taken at the euro area summit on 27 October would be the \"main task\" of his government.
Spain is in the line of sight of the markets, while the legislative elections in the country are held on Sunday.
The difference in rate - spread - between the 10-year obligations of Germany and Spain has reached a new historical level.
Waiting for euro area growth figures
With statistics, France recorded an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, a little better than 0.3% expected, driven by household consumption.
However, the Insee revised the second quarter figure, with a fall of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
And it's really the fourth one that most worries economists.
Germany, for its part, recorded a 0.5% growth over the same period.
A first estimate for the euro area as a whole is expected at 11 a.m. while the European Commission has just warned against the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
the facts must take it on dogmas
If it is a subject that cannot be dealt with from short-term considerations or under the tone of emotion, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly influence the purchasing power and competitiveness of businesses.
It is clear that an election meeting is an opportunity to reflect on such issues and on the place where nuclear is held.
The debate will only be fruitful if it explores all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their views on objective facts, rational data.
While we are 7 billion human beings on the planet, demographic developments will double the demand for electricity by 2050, unless a huge part of the world's population is deprived of a vital element.
At the same time, fossil resources will need to be reduced in order to continue to produce electricity on a permanent basis, not to mention the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate change, a subject that has disappeared from the environmental debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to give up nuclear power.
It is not Belgium, nor Belgium, who submits to the need to find a replacement source capable of replacing itself, nor Switzerland, which just wants to build last-generation plants.
On the other hand, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to name a few, continue their projects with determination.
The United States, they, decided after Fukushima to add a unit to their park by resuming the construction of a power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident.
If the German model, which focuses on renewable energies, is sometimes presented as an example, the reality is contrary to the speech.
The choice of Berlin will result in the increase in the electricity price, an energy dependence aggravated by the increased use of imported gas, in particular Russia, a bond of CO2 emissions resulting from the construction of gas and coal plants.
In a few months, all these unpleasant effects are already felt.
The case of Denmark is to be considered.
Its electricity is also one of the largest users of coal and gas as a result of the wind's intermittentness; hence, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are 65% and 50% higher than the European average respectively.
On the other hand, thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbours pay an electricity bill of more than 40% than that of French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of the maintenance of the industrial tool in the national territory, French companies benefit from the least expensive electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction on the part of nuclear would result in a strong increase in the price of electricity, which would make illusory statements about the re-industrialization of our country and the defense of purchasing power illusory.
A price that a large majority of French people refuse to pay, especially since they do not show any opposition in principle to this energy, polls show it.
Let us remember that our country's energy policy has enabled us to build an industrial network of 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 induced jobs.
Strongly exporting, it results in a galaxy of specialised SMEs in international markets and makes them very job-creating and non-localized.
If France had just decided to come out of nuclear power, it would be sacrificing a large number of these SMEs by reducing the annual US$6 billion of exports of nuclear equipment and services as mourning skin.
Which electrician would order an EPR designed to run sixty years while the decline of its manufacturer would be programmed?
To solve the energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no source of miraculous electricity production, no more than there is a diabolical one.
The development by Areva of low-emitting solutions of CO2, nuclear and renewables, demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear safety, maintaining the highest level of safety is an absolute imperative.
We have in France a Safety Authority that exercises intransigent and transparent control over existing power stations as on the Flamanville construction site.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, are inhabited by the same obsession with security.
In a half-century, the nuclear industry had three major accidents.
One, Three Mile Island, has intervened under normal operating conditions; it has remained without human or environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, the reactor design and unforgivable human errors caused the drama.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident results from two unprecedented natural disasters that have caused the death of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident, as it had done for the previous two.
As a result of this approach and cooperation between the security authorities, operators and French and German manufacturers, the EPR presents a design that makes it capable of resisting such phenomena.
While it is considered by all electricians wishing to build a power plant, the halting of its construction in Flamanville would be a beautiful gift offered to competitors in Areva and EDF by leaving them the free way to take the lead in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is essential and legitimate to seek the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotion, dogmas and partisan maneuvers dominate such a decisive debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy carried out under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized in various angles - engorgement of the police, judicial and administrative services subject to the number policy, compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of France's \"country of human rights\".
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students who have made the news, the Minister of the Interior (Freedom of 23 May) proclaiming to the passage that France - does not need foreign talents, masons and restaurant servers -
But it is rarely analyzed from an economic point of view.
There is a fairly broad consensus between left and right on this subject.
On the right, the tone was given by Jacques Chirac, who stated in 1976 that in a country of nearly 2 million immigrant workers, 900 000 unemployed people should not be a problem, and on the left, by Michel Rocard, explaining that France cannot accept all the misery of the world in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, the fear of invasion of the national territory by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared to the left as well as to the right.
For both sides, immigrants are seen as a burden on the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity that immigrants will be granted.
In his program, François Hollande is meeting banalities, indicating that co-development will solve our \"migration problem\"
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be paid electorally; but it is economically very costly.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recall in a recent book summing up the most recent knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is broad consensus among experts on the positive impact of migratory flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
Restricting anemia immigration to growth and night work.
Fears of the impact of migrants are based on the idea that migrants are likely to substitute for national workers, particularly the low-skilled, with lower pressures on their wages.
But experience shows that immigrants are, in fact, much more complementary than substitutes for national employees, most of which are traded in sectors with a shortage of jobs.
Unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national employees, and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training does not follow job supply.
A positive effect on wages
In the same way that a surgeon will find it difficult to work in a country with a shortage of anaesthetists, these complementaritys between nationals and migrants have a positive effect on the wages and employment of nationals.
Giovanni Peri thus calculated that a 1% increase in migratory flows results in an increase between 0.6 and 0.9% in real wages in the long term.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (strong proportion of naturalized immigrants among the American Nobel prizes; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems, on average up to 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The World Labour Organization, for example, estimates that in Germany, an immigrant who reaches the age of 30 will make a net contribution (less revenue) of EUR 150000 to public budgets on average over his entire life.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted, at the beginning of the mandate, to search for missing growth points - with teeth -
The teeth in question, using to deter immigrants, had the exact opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, European democracy remains to be thought
Democracy is a valuable asset; it is also a fragile one.
The European continent should be able to remember him who, in order to have invented it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, throughout the twentieth century experienced the tragedies of the Great War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Goulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some may have thought that it would be enough, in order for democracy to finally triumph over its enemies, to exercise the vote, and to exercise it in the most direct way.
We know, since Napoleon the Little One, that this was an ease of thought.
Universal suffrage, in order to be the necessary condition of democracy, is not the sufficient condition and can even become - an instrument of oppression - as the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and control of powers, an education, lights, economic and social solidarity, a justice.
The crisis in Europe we live in is an economic crisis, but it is also, first and foremost, a crisis of politics and democracy.
The paleness of the true Greek referendum will have had in this regard the value of double revelation: that of the need for a powerful return of the policy, but also that of the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
This ambivalentness must be thought to be exceeded.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have now moved, and that, for many of them, Republican soldiers are no longer heading in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain to demand a succession of national referendums, organized in order for needs and in order to be dispersed.
A white-sealing at the European absolute monarch or a foot jump attached in the void of the nationalist fold: what choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want cuts, but a common exercise, of full right, serene and continuous, of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - there is no longer any place to stop the numbering - because there is only a crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that is filled with the dictates of markets and rating agencies, which suffer from its impotence and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is humiliated on the international stage.
We are concerned about transfers of sovereignty to Europe - but it is the whole of Europe that loses its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The urgent need is to give people sovereignty back the piloting of the European project.
Because it is together that Europeans can reduce the weight of their debts, release markets and prepare for the future by investing.
The outcome of the crisis will involve decisions at European level that cannot be made without total democratic legitimacy, except of course to lead us to disaster.
After long fighting this proposal by the socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone today calls for the European economic government.
Right.
But to think of it without a stronger political and democratic integration, and lived as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and a new impasse.
We must take a new step in the construction of Europe.
In order to do the Republic in France, it had to be done by the Republicans.
The Revolution in Interests could not be enough.
This lesson remains valid.
We need to build a more economically integrated Europe.
This can only be done by building a more politically democratic Europe, a true European popular sovereignty.
To make Europe, let's make Europeans.
The smart cards - without contact - are widespread
The world's fleaboard salon opens on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, in an optimistic climate.
The year 2011 is expected to end on an 11% increase in world sales of microprocessor cards (bank card, telephone with SIM card...), to more than 6 billion units, according to Eurosmart firm.
The most important segment is that of uncontacted technology that allows you to pay for public transportation or to settle your purchases by simply approaching a reader's card.
This year, 460 million flea cards without contact should be sold around the world, compared to 320 million a year earlier!
Their share is still expected to grow in 2012 (580 million units expected) and represent almost 10% of the overall bid market (6,925 million cards).
Long on the trail of the Asia-Pacific region, Europe earns ground for payment without contact.
Some 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 cards without contact Visa have been deployed.
But the large surfaces put the caps double.
This year, Carrefour issued 2.5 million Pass MasterCard cards without contact.
To get to the top speed, it is now necessary for banks to equip their customers.
“Two major French institutions have committed themselves to systematically spread to their customers banking cards equipped for contactlessness,” announces Gérard Nebouy, Director General Visa Europe France.
Banks test payment by mobile
But it is only a first step towards the way of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
Few devices are now equipped with the necessary NFC (Near Field Communication) technology to perform transactions.
\"They're late.\"
\"But they should finally know a real boom next year\"
“We are tabling on the sale of 80 to 120 million units in 2012 worldwide,” explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But banks take the lead.
The Agricultural Credit announced yesterday the launch of a test from December to June next in Caen.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and collaborators will be equipped with a case allowing payment without contact.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the General Company, too, said yesterday to prepare the market for an offer allowing its customers to pay without contact with their mobile.
From Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front extends
Paris is concerned about the links between al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
Long-standing suspects, the links between the al-Qaida terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs Abdelkader Messahel even claimed that Algiers has now - acquired the certainty -
\"The way the two organizations operate and the reports of intelligence services show that there is good cooperation,\" he explained without further clarification.
Paris seems to do a similar analysis.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two French people in Niger last January would have updated bridges.
Kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by close relatives of Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the next day along with several of their ravistors during an operation launched by the French special forces.
In the breakdowns of the intervention, the French and Nigerian investigators had to find several telephone chips belonging to the terrorists.
Terrorist Axis
The analysis of past calls guides several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two issues are of particular interest to the investigators: one leads to a Nigerian who has long stayed in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram and the other to a man who says himself close to Aqmi and the sect.
\"It's an advance, but you probably have to wait for more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram.\"
\"But it's possible\"
\"It has been known for years that the sect has received financial and intellectual support from outside and that it is becoming increasingly active,\" says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, this support had been increasingly evident in the evolution and discourses of Boko Haram or in its operating modes, which now involve the use of kamikazes or explosive devices that are increasingly complex and invoiced as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has therefore pressured Abuja to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have long considered the group as a community of illuminated little worth of interest.
A rapid success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and fundamentalist magnet Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means in haousssa - Western education is a sin - - it advocates the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the northern Muslim of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association has a rapid success.
It is polite and requires strict respect for the sharia while its activists engage in the fight against the central government.
The latter are aimed first at churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram's militants were particularly active, increasing attacks on police stations.
Abuja's reaction is, as usual, without nuances.
The army is investing the city, 800 of us are dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested alive, is killed in prison.
Therefore the sect will radicalize and leave its fiefs from the north.
Last Christmas, she claimed an attack that killed 80 in Jos, then another in Abuja.
In June, it was still in Abuja that Boko Haram took it to the police-secured QG during a suicide attack, his first.
In August, the United Nations headquarters will be its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa that would navigate from Mauritania to Somalia by passing through Nigeria is now a matter of concern to all security specialists.
While Aqmi invested Mali and Niger, which al-Shebab Somalis operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears to be a new threat to the heart of the continent.
Last week, at a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Haram and said he was ready to share all the information.
The world according to Republican candidates to the presidency
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry are rivaling simplicity and ignorance.
Can an America weakened by the crisis manage a complex world with simple, even simplistic ideas?
To listen to Republican presidential candidates, voters might believe that.
In the past few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the others have been multiplying the upsurges and cuts in foreign policy, traditionally a strong republican point.
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, slogans - often not supported - flee.
Mitt Romney, best placed in the race for the appointment of the \"Great Old Party\", threatened to drag the Chinese to the WTO and challenge them - for the manipulation of their currency - a theme that leads to an America exasperated by the migration of the entire lines of its industry to Asia.
Whether this should involve the outbreak of a commercial war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former ambassador to China of Obama and the only candidate to have a sophisticated foreign policy vision, has failed to strangle against an attitude that - inflates - emotions.
He called for a muscular but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama's current position).
But Huntsman, who stagnates in the depths of the polls, remains inaudible.
In Reagan's image
Romney has also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear programme.
\"If I'm elected, I'll stop Iran, he bragged.\"
\"If Obama is re-elected, they'll have the bomb\"
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing his obligations to this partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best-placed candidate, shows him a embarrassing ignorance of the files.
Recently, he called for the Chinese military threat because Beijing - trying to develop nuclear capacity - apparently unaware of China's military atom since 1964!
The Texan Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikes against Iran, says he is ready to hire the American army in Mexico against drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
We are far from the 2008 Republican candidate, John McCain, a heavy foreign political force.
The opponents of the current president replied that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the cold war.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to put water in his wine on anti-terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of their naïve dialogue with Iran, on the over-precipitation of the \"boys\" of Iraq, on its hijackings in Libya, thus picking up a low label.
But the attack is not that easy.
The population is rather positive about Obama's national security balance sheet, which eliminated Ben Laden.
Since Iraq, she has been wary of military interventions that lead to enlistment.
And, arguing that it is necessary to rebuild America economically to raise its leadership, Obama strikes fairer.
North Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The North Stream pipeline, directly connecting Western Europe to Russia through the bottom of the Baltic Sea, entered into service.
It must provide gas for the equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with bursts.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, participated last Tuesday on the shores of the Baltic, between the orchestra and the final buffet, at the inauguration of the North Stream, this new pipeline that directly connects Russia to Germany under the sea.
Symbolically, the German chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte together turned the wheel of the valve commanding the entrance of Russian gas into the western European network.
With this new pipeline, 27.5 billion cubic metres of additional Russian gas will arrive each year in Western Europe by a first 1,224 km tube connecting the St. Petersburg region to the Land of Mecklembourg-Pomerania.
A second tube must be completed at the end of 2012, allowing a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas to be delivered, i.e. the equivalent of all French consumption.
And we already mention the possibility of building a third on the same course.
For Gazprom, the completion in time and time of this huge construction site has won airs.
The project had been strongly contested by Poland and the Baltic countries.
The North Stream will allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany, avoiding any land passage through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
These two countries, in turn, lose a little of their power: it becomes more difficult for them to weigh on Russia by threatening to shut down access to western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare North Stream to a new German-Soviet pact, in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is whether the issue is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, by supporting this Russian project, has gained greater security of its supplies.
But it is at the cost of a weakening of Europe's energy, as the project has created a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
Russia had only five years to triumph over its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, which are heavily gas-consumer, and whose deposits are declining.
This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that binds us organically, and it has confirmed François Fillon by inaugurating this gas pipeline, demonstrating to what extent large gas contracts are both political and economic.
All this explains the wide smiles displayed by the Gazprom leaders, present in number in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical feat.
The submarine tube is made of concrete-boiled steel to protect it against the anchors of the ships.
It rests on the bottom of the sea, at 200 m on average.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating from World War II.
A hundred have had to be removed or destroyed, with caution, by Jens Müller, spokesperson for North Stream.
It was also necessary to increase measures to protect wildlife and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake, heavy as 242 Eiffel towers, which nothing interrupts on its entire length: neither valve nor maintenance station.
A control platform was planned outside Sweden, but the project managers abandoned it while the Swedish people were reluctant to see a Russian State company established permanently off their coasts.
- In case of failure, we stop the gas passage in less than a minute - Jens Müller says.
In the event of a leak, the gas contained in the gas pipeline therefore escapes into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by manufacturers who have planned welds to experience a leak every 100,000 years.
The surveillance of the state of the gas pipeline is carried out by a submarine robot, driven by a ship, for external observation, as well as by a device that circulates inside the gas pipeline.
In the form of a cigar, it is introduced inside the tube, wide by a meter of diameter, and is pushed by the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of trip at the speed of 3 meters second, he delivers accurate information on the possible deformations of the metal.
The pipeline was designed to operate for fifty years without having to undergo any repairs.
The flow of gas is simply driven by pressure.
It is 200 bars from the start, and 100 bars from the finish.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
German E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as Dutch Gasunie and French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have set up a joint venture, named North Stream, which is responsible for building and operating the pipeline.
It has its headquarters in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased to this company, for twenty years renewable, the full capacity for gas transport.
“Gazprom will pay for total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported,” says Jens Müller.
Funding for the construction of the pipeline was provided to 30% by shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the work is expected to reach EUR 7.4 billion for both tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, investment has risen to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure to return to their fees, since only Gazprom takes the risk.
The gas pipeline emerges from the Baltic to Lubmin, on a sandy coastline planted with pines.
Valves, 4.5 metres high, form the gas outlet door.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specificities of the gas that happens before it is transferred to the German gas pipelines.
Since Tuesday, this terminal has been receiving a million cubic metres of Russian gas every hour.
At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012, 6 million.
Moleskine, a brand name book.
Created 15 years ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to restore the taste of writing.
It has a scent of adventures, hours spent writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine Carnet is easily recognizable, with its black rectangular cover, elastic, leaves of a broken white colour, like old ages over time.
However, the Moleskine Carnet as we know it today was born... in 1997.
The Italian Modo Modo company, based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a design but distinguished notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then consultant for the company, is responsible for the launch of the new product.
The notebook is inspired by an old production technique, the mole skin (tape skin) which means a varnish cotton used to cover banquets, for example.
This type of notebook was very popular with writers and travelers.
· Moleskine has given to the taste of the day an old and forgotten object, which was an icon of the avant-garde artists, until the 20th century - , tells Maria Sebregondi, who has become responsible for the brand at Modemo.
The success is there.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to 12.7 million coins.
We are far from the confidential production of the first years, where only 3,000 books were designed.
Moleskine goes beyond the Italian borders and exports to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to establish a portrait-robot of the buyer, as the notebook seduces both the businessman and the student and the professionals.
Like Moleskine, its consumers are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultivated.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees at its beginning, has almost 100 today and has since 2008 two offices; one in Milan and the other in New York.
It distributes its books in bookstores, from Fnac to small shops in downtown and has been able to impose its identity.
“We followed the air of time and this new need for writing, despite the appearance of e-mails,” explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand has launched an exhibition - Detour - where architects or artists exhibit their own notebook.
In August, she also launched a leopard cover on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and cultural aura, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: bags, agenda, pens, computer covers...The brand declines over a wide range of media.
A success that made some envy: in the fall of 2006, Modo was bought by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why does the unemployment rate of disabled workers remain so high?
Approximately 19% of people with disabilities are looking for work.
The 15th week for the employment of disabled people is now open.
Despite a voluntary public policy set up in 2005, the unemployment rate of persons with disabilities is still twice as high as the average: 19%, compared with 9% for the entire population.
Discouraging?
No, says Éric Blanchet, Director General of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of the disabled.
- The progress made over the past 15 years is considerable. -
At the time, the unemployment rate was not two but three times higher.
“However, there is still a great deal to be done.”
It must be said that, for the disabled, obstacles remain many before accessing employment.
They are rather older: 37% are over 50 (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% do not have the bac and on the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is widespread: 53% for the disabled, compared with 38% on average.
In short, so many criteria that make the return to employment particularly difficult, and which - the core of the problem - are, according to Christian Grapin, Director General of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help businesses recruit disabled workers.
This is for the objective brakes.
There remains the non-say, the attitudes that evolve, of course, but too slowly.
A study carried out in April by the IMS-Entrepreneur for the City indicated that the managers interviewed had a low level of knowledge of disability, with an over-representation of people in wheelchairs, psychic or intellectual deficits.
As a result, private enterprises with more than 20 employees are still far from reaching the employment target of 6% disabled workers, set out in a law of... 1987.
The last known figures from 2008 reported a ratio of 2.6%.
We are now around 3%, says Pierre Blanc, Chief Executive Officer of the Agency, the agency responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with this law.
The evidence: the number of establishments - taxed -, as well as the amounts paid, decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
The 2005 Act, which increased contributions, created a strong pressure on businesses, explains Pierre Blanc.
However, this improvement also translates into real awareness, especially in large groups.
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of institutions from 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared with 82% of enterprises from 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: “What a joy”
Before facing the Blues Tuesday night (20h45) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure of getting them this friendly game.
We will not until we write that there was a conniency between them, but the image is symbolic.
Standing side by side on the stage of the stadium of France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have made peace well.
Five months after the act of humor of his attacker against Turkey, the Belgian selectioner has only praise to do so.
\"I am very pleased with Eden, his progress and his being a Belgian.\"
\"I want to move forward,\" said Lillois.
As for the contrast between his club and selection benefits, -it is a whole, it is justified -
\"In Lille, I am there all year, which is not the case with Belgium\"
\"I have to take my marks.\"
Mixed against Romania Friday night for this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally-briller-
However, it does not omit the notion of “pleasantness”
The Bleus has been encouraging them since the age of 7 and the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
\"I've always been supportive,\" he says.
This must be involved in further strengthening the \"particular\" character of this meeting.
So far, there is Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami), and remember him.
\"We've been through it all the time.\"
\"Can play against them, it's just happiness.\"
With bonhomie, Leekens for his part spoke of \"fierty\"
‘Fierté de puuter — un match de galatia
\"Believed - also to note - as \"a neighbour\" - that France has become a very high-level team - a little more than a year after Knysna's trauma.
\"Laurent Blanc has done a tonner work,\" he was excited.
While Belgium will miss the next Euro, the technician would like to share the aircraft with the Blue Directions... Brazil in 2014.
“In small Belgians, it has become great,” he stressed.
\"We're building something, players are ambitious, they're hungry\"
\"You're going to find out about it in the next matches - the one against France included.
Portugal is very confident
The Portugal of Paulo Bento starts with a lot of optimism its dam back to Bosnia (22:00), this Tuesday in Lisbon.
On the way, the two teams lacked realism.
At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country.
Paulo Bento is already in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no shadow of a doubt, the Selecçao, which has been at the hands since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 Euro.
Portugal is, in fact, only 90 minutes from happiness.
But there's a game to play, and an opponent, Bosnia, to roll.
In view of the match going (0-0), Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seemed obvious that the games are not made.
Portugal dominated the party for more than an hour, of course, but it was unable to mark this precious goal, which would have relieved it.
- This is a good result, but it has a certain risk because we have no purpose outside it -
But in their home, in their bright Light Stadium in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to pass, in front of a public who should be there as boiling, even though the part clearly announces - very tight - said an optimistic but lucid Bento.
“We are waiting for a very tight match, but we are quite convinced that we can take over,” said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
We continue to have 50% chance of being at the 2012 Euro, but the successor of Carlos Queiroz has also been relativized.
The no-reported Bosnia Friday forces the Portuguese to mark and win.
A zero can be enough for the Bosnians, who also need to mark.
It's a good result, but it has a certain risk because we haven't had a sense of purpose outside - Bento regrets.
We are going to play against a team that has many technical qualities and has players with many individual qualities, he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will have the intention to put a maximum pressure on the Bosnians so as not to - give them time to think about it. -
A good idea, provided to be realistic, this time.
