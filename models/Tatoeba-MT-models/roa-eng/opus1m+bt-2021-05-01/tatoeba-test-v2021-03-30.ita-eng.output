Tom wasn't very active.
We cleaned the way out of the snow yesterday.
I'm not at all busy right now.
Tom doesn't think he'll win.
Maybe you should listen.
He's a brilliant artist.
Get a move on, guys.
I like your painting.
I waited for an hour and a half.
I'm not good at math.
Tom refused to say what he did.
I don't like your hat.
I can't be happy when Tom's so sad.
I want to share this with you.
I'm studying at Hyogo University.
We'll participate in the marathon.
Maybe I should tell you.
I know what to study.
His life was going smoothly.
Nobody wants to help us.
They speak very quickly.

It's urgent to go to the bathroom.
Mary really looks like her mother.
He had no money to buy the farm.

Tomorrow, God willing, we'll be with your parents.
It's from Sweden.
He had no money to buy the farm.
Did you really believe that?

I feel protected.
You're the tallest.
Isn't that funny, Tom?
Tom was born on October 20.
It's a beautiful photograph.
I'll leave her alone.
Tom won't even look at me.
We humiliated them.
He's already here.
I know who my enemy is.
Tom needs to sleep now.
Tom's not honest.
Tom's father is a cop.
Tom works here?
That's what Tom was looking for.
What did you do to her?
Tom wanted to send a message.
I wasn't happy to see them.
Don't break my heart.
I don't have plans for tonight.
Stop being constantly sarcastic!
She was crying.
I wish I could be rich like you.
We had fun.
She's dishonest.
I often read books.
Tom and I want to talk to her about something.
I can meet you at 2:30.
Tom got angry.
I'm already old.
I've got the dirty criminal record.
Good night, my friends.
He bought a book in English in a bookstore.
I'll go to the bookstore tomorrow and buy some books.
What would the world be without women?
They tell us funny stories.
Can you hear what Tom's saying?
What's your favorite historical movie?
We can't see her.
Tom and I still love each other.
Tom needs to eat.
Everybody go.
Giant pandas live only in China.
I'm on my way.
Don't say things like that.
It's worse than that!
Jim's a Canadian.
You've done well here.

Tom was playing football.
Stop snooping.
I know her.
The real heroes are us.
We're waiting for Tom.
Unfortunately, my birthday is only once a year.
Put your bike away.
I understood it as a compliment.
They called President Roosevelt pirate.
I could go to the movies.
It's not a date.
It makes me nervous.
Who do you think told them?
Why did Tom give it to Mary?
Listen to her!
He's good at this game, isn't he?
Take care of them.
I live in the islands, Figi.
You want to eat with us?
You don't seem too surprised.
I'm not going to school on Saturday.
It's my job to protect you.
Tom's pissed, isn't he?
Does this cage have the purpose of protecting from sharks?
Tom wants to get to know Mary better.
I'm very disappointed.
Tom wants more coffee.
Who do you think is the author of this novel?
I wish you'd called me.
Don't you want a job?
I played the trombone when I was younger.
I'm faithful.
To write in Braille?
I don't know what happened to him.
I'm free today.
Why do you want to kill us?
He ate an apple.
I caught him.
He adopted the orphan.
I guess they're talking French.
Take a step forward.
You need to become more active.
Are Tom and Mary kidding?
She broke the smoke.
I have no choice.
I think Tom knows who lives in that house.
He's smarter than him.
What will you do this summer?
It gets irritated.
Do you know how to speak shanghainese?
It narrowed down because I washed it.
Tom was wearing an old pair of shoes.
Tom wondered what happened to Mary.
Something bad happened to them.
How much was paid?
They didn't touch anything.
Do you like horror movies?
I know a lot about animals.
Don't hold your breath.
Am I in London?
She's still there with you, isn't she?
This will make a big difference.
Tom didn't have much money with him.
Tom doesn't have a big appetite.
Were you with them that night?
I was running.
The village died after sunset.
What's your favorite rapper woman?
Say hello to Tom for me.
It's nice to see you so happy.
I usually swim in summer.
Why is he leaving soon?
I'm pretty proud of it.
I smell gas.
I'll tell them it's not true.
Here's his picture.
I can depend on my friends.
The experiment confirmed his theory.
Tom's lucky.
Pass me the ketchup, please.
It happened that I sat next to you at a convention.
There are no furniture left in the room.
Tom showed up early for the lesson.
He's a little overweight, isn't he?
Who's the man playing the plan?
I decided not to do it again.
No, I haven't written it yet.
You have to listen to Tom.
He slept in the car.
Tom and I are going to Boston with Mary.
He spends all his drinks.
Search harder on Google!
It's not the only problem with your idea.
You talk like you're the boss.
You want me to go with you?
I came to see her.
Do you look familiar?
I'll check your game tomorrow.
So, what should I tell him?
It's starting to rain.
Are you playing any instruments?
Will they die?
I really like it.
Are you guys coming in?
Tom stabbed her.
I have no feelings.
She's incredibly stupid.
We're landed on a lonely island.
It takes patience.
He convinced the teacher.
When does your new novel come out?
I would never betray her.
Are you aware of any problems?
The mystery remains unresolved.
I will never forget Germany.

You're good.
How would you like to change it?
It's snowy today.

I wasn't born deaf.
We should leave you alone.
I can't raise our son alone.
Go get some milk.
Tom seemed surprised.
I love being right.
Tom married a rich girl from Boston.
I forgot whether you drank wine or not.
Who warned them?
Abbia faith in God.
\"I will give 50 thousand for this statue.\" \"Who will offer more\"
Why would anyone want to kiss her?
He should have bought a used car.
I'm going to stay at the hotel.
I didn't grow up like that.
You can park here.
Please tell him to hurry.
Tom hated them.
I miss almost every day.
I won't apologize.
We really like picnics.
I haven't talked to him yet.
It was a hot summer night.
I always walk.
It's decisive.
You're not very fun at parties, are you?
He searched his bag for the keys to the car.
I don't really want to talk.
So it must be Argentine.
I really like my job.
I would suggest you be more cautious.
She's shocked.
He was supposed to do it yesterday.
I'm a big fan of American cuisine.
Tom's dancing with Mary.
Your destiny is in my hands.
No, you don't have to go now.
Nobody wants to help you.
He'll move in the afternoon.
Get blind.
We subscribe to a newspaper.
I thought it was a combination.
What do you imagine when you look at that picture?
How many continents are in the world?
He's good at singing, isn't he?
Tom's mad at Mary, right?
His idea is superior to his.
Tom never forgave me.
I'm the expert.

I'm still busy.
I appreciate your intuitions.
I went to the park this morning.
Tom loves fly fishing.
We have no choice but to risk it.
I don't want to play chess.
Mary is jealous.
I should have changed the oil.
Do you have a calculator?

We need to inform Tom.
Tom's still asleep.
Tom's a little impulsive, isn't he?
You agree with Tom, right?
Tom didn't take much money.

Must be hot.

He hired me.
I said I'd take it.
I knew they were watching me.
I have plans with them tonight.
I could meet someone who could help you.

It was published in 1969.
We just need to relax.

Look, I'll show you.
I said she was innocent.
Fear of failure is one of the most widespread fears in the world.
Why are you so jealous?
You think Tom killed Mary?
How come you don't have anything to say?
Scandalous!
Come on, Tom, aren't you curious?
Keep your tongue down.
I drank the wine.
He's more popular than I am.
When can I get out of here?
You're back in advance.
We left this.
All I want is to go fishing.
Would you like to take this?
Tom didn't want to go back to the orphanage.
Gold is heavier than iron.
I'll find one later.
At least I'm older than you.

Forgive me for interrupting the other day.
Can you believe us? We are in Europe!
I was waiting for a bus to arrive.
He found the chemist.

You're overwhelmed by the bad news.
This car doesn't belong to me.
Are you listening, Tom?
He often shows his anger.

Let's listen to music.
I think it's dangerous for kids to play in the pond.
She bought me a nice coat.
The bell rang.
Take him to the men in room 318.
I'm falling in love with her.
We must postpone our departure.
Tom doesn't even care.
We were separated.
It's early.
You saved Tom's life twice.
I don't like big cities.
That happened to me.
He doesn't have a few friends in America.

You're disturbing her.
Sami is not here to ruin your day.
I took my shoes.
I'm learning Esperanto now.
He hired mercenaries to kill Sami.
Is that yours?
The woman drinks water now.
Tom was a lawyer.
People here are demanding about what they eat, so even if a restaurant is inexpensive, it will soon close the beat if the food does not taste good.
The man Tom and Mary are talking to is a lawyer.
He changed his diet.
He's a man of his word.
I'm free tonight.
You think I'm too tall?
What should we do now?
Tom tried a new technique.
Were you bandaged?
Are you interested?

You look raised.
You should have kissed Tom.
I know I'm wrong.

Complete the sentence.
The clock's broken.

He's becoming famous.
What are you indicating?
I became friends with him while I was in Taiwan.
He was intimidated by his intelligence.
You've got the balloon.
We have to go.
Staying home is not fun.
I'm sure Tom will be awake.
She can't find her hat.
Mr. Young would like his son to study more.
I opened an account in a bank nearby.

I'm really worried about them.
He clearly wants to go.
I knew Tom would do something romantic.
How much letter do you need?
Can you confirm that?
It was a waste of money.
Tom's talking to Mary on the phone.
Bring some wine.
I was very proud.
You're very fast.
How about a beer?
I had no idea you guys were so stupid.
They're not alive.
I'm hiding in Japan.
You're a brave man.
Aren't you surprised?
It only costs one coin.
I hope Tom and Mary are wrong.
My spoon is too big!
Give them a moment.
Let's eat together tonight.
I don't expect you to remember.
Take the picture.
You're my three best friends.
Have you tried talking to him?
Where'd you eat?
He's the last person who can tell a lie.
June isn't that far.
Why does Tom hate it so much?
Do you know who said that?
I'm going to bed early tonight.
He kicked me out of the house.
My shoes were wet.
The key was left in the room.
You're gonna leave me?
You always liked Tom.
Why do you care?
Give him a hand, okay?
You wanted to ask me some questions?
Don't play Tom.
You'll land on your feet.
I took risks.
Two people were killed in a road accident.
You know Tom, right?
It wasn't my idea to hire them.
Last night my grandmother died without suffering.

You know Tom likes cars.
You passed the exam.
Tom imitated Mary.

Don't fall out of the chair.
Tom sent us Christmas gifts.
Can't Tom swim?
Kids usually get up early at Christmas.

Why doesn't he sit with me anymore?
I want you to look for them.
I left the party too soon.

I'm not sure George will like this idea.
They're afraid to say it publicly.

You're leaving us.
It would be nice to spend the summer in the mountains.
I lost it.
I almost dropped the plates.
There's a phone in my room.
Is it serious?
Tom made 911.
We're brother and sister.
Are you interested in Buddhism?
This week was beautiful.
You want a tray with that?
You don't know me.

Please drive more slowly.
How do we fix it?

It's a bundle of nerves.
Tom arrived late.
Tom stayed back.
This point will be discussed tomorrow.
How'd your vacation go?
When he left the Army, Roger Miller moved to the country music house in Nashville, Tennessee.

Can I get you some coffee?
He left the village so he could study.
I've never seen you dance.
Tom's been lying for a closer look.
Can you save them?
So you and Hanna are thinking about getting married?
You can drive, right?
They need us to finish the job.
I've been here twice now.

Mary accidentally crashed into Tom.
I'm nobody's enemy.
I forgot her number.
The two teams fought very hard.
I think there's a mistake in my account.
Tom didn't convince me.
Sami had some painful secrets.
You want me to be honest?
What are you gonna do?
Tom seems tired, take him home, please.
May all your wishes come true!
He's already done it.
He is expert with a word processor.
He was at the death gate.
You're hurt, aren't you?
His table is ready.
Will it be hot again tomorrow?
Tom and Mary have a car, right?
Now let's talk.
I can't solve this problem.
He hit her in the head.
It's gonna be a lot of fun.

Do your business!
She was extremely scary.
I'm telling a story.
You're homesick, aren't you?
What are you going to eat tomorrow?

Do you like to travel?
I want to go back to Tom's house.

He was buried in this cemetery.
Again, bye.
Lucky to meet you here.
Is anyone waiting?
You're an over-optimistic girl.
Is this your umbrella?
