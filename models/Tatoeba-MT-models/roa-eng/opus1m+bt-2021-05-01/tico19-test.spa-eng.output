Cumulative incidence on rapid increase in coronary virus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union or the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronary virus disease (COVID-19) shows similar trends in the European Union or the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, confirming that, although at different stages according to the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is moving rapidly across all countries.
Based on the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should improve their preparation for a wave of patients with CVID-19 who will require medical care and, in particular, intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a conglomerate of cases of unknown etiology pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, province of Hubei, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of China reported that the causing agent was a new coronavirus that is now known as coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronary virus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence to date indicates that 80% of people with CVID-19 have a mild disease, i.e. respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, and that most are recovered.
In 14% of cases, CVID-19 evolves into a more serious disease requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% of cases develop a critical disease requiring intensive care.
Mortality in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we examined trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each European Union country or the European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compared them with those in the province of Hubei, China.
We also compare the current number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEE countries and the UK with Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK countries
After China, the COVID-19 continued to geographically spread and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world currently follows that of this country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In the 5 March edition of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported on the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe in accordance with the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were recorded in France on 24 January 2020 in persons returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As at 15 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 had been detected in the 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), according to which between 31 December 2019 and that inclusive date, 39 768 cases and 1727 deaths had occurred, of which 17 750 cases and 1441 deaths had occurred in Italy only.
Accrued amount and accumulated incidence of CVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), the case counts of COVID-19 reported in each country of the world, obtained only from official sources, such as the Ministry of Health of countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO, are updated daily at 8:00 a.m.
These data were used to examine the trends of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK and to compare them with that of Italy.
As an indicator of the prevalence of the active cases of COVID-19, we calculated the cumulative incidence of cases of COVID-19 truncated to 14 days; thus, we took into account the natural course of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA country and the UK, during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also present the accumulated number of cases reported in each country as at 15 March 2020, at 8 a.m., compared with that of Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Trends of COVID-19 in EU/EEA and UK countries
Trends in the cumulative incidence of CVID-19 cases truncated to 14 days in the EU/EEE countries and the UK, in general, followed that in the province of Hubei (China) (Figure 1).
In the EU/EEA and the UK in general, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase around 21 February and then significantly increased around 28 February 2020 (complementary material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of reported cases in Italy, but all other EU/EEE countries and the UK showed upward trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 similar (complementary material).
Figure 2 shows the accumulated number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the UK, compared with that of Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It points out that, as at 15 March at 8:00 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had already recorded a total number of cases comparable to Italy only 3 weeks before or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported CVID-19 cases is rapidly increasing in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Trends in the cumulative incidence of VOC-19 suggest that the pandemic is progressing at a similar rate in all countries.
This is despite the different stages in which countries are located, variations in national public health responses, and possibly different case definitions in different countries and protocols to select patients to be tested to confirm COVID-19, including delayed tests.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors in the regions affected by Italy described a situation where 10% of patients with CVID-19 required intensive care, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on admissions of CVID-19 cases to a hospital or intensive care unit are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6 % and 1 % of cases, respectively (no data are shown).
However, they should be systematically collected to complement current monitoring data that focus on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study conducted in 2010-11 showed a wide variation in the availability of intensive care beds and intermediate care in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 inhabitants in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12,5 beds of intensive care and intermediate care every 100,000 inhabitants in 2010-11).
Model scenarios relating to the saturation of the medical care capacity, with calculations for each EU/EEE country and the RU of the prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalization cases associated with a risk >90 % overcoming the capacity of intensive care beds, are provided in the sixth update of ECDC's rapid risk assessment on COVID-19.
Since so far, conglomerates of cases have been formed in certain regions of EU/EEA countries and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units are usually attended by a defined regional catchment population, information on cases and intensive care beds should preferably be made available at the nomenclature of statistical territorial units 2 (NUTS-2).
Italy's experience and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is moving rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should therefore prepare for a sustained community transmission scenario of SARS-COV-2 and an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 requiring medical care and, in particular, intensive care, such as in the affected regions of Italy.
As indicated in ECDC's rapid risk assessment, it is essential to take a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2, with a shift from a containment approach to a mitigation approach, since the rapid increase expected in the number of cases may not give sufficient time to decision makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly if not implemented in advance.
The rapid risk assessment also lists the public health measures necessary to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a brief opportunity period during which countries have the possibility to deepen their control efforts to curb the spread of SARS-COV-2 and reduce the pressure on the health system.
If this is not done, health systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to face a wave of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days and weeks.
The disease outbreak by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (SARS-COV-2), has so far caused the death of 3000 people and has infected more than 80,000 in China and in other parts of the world, resulting in a catastrophe for humans.
Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-COV, which provoked SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-COV-2 could also be transmitted from the bat and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality than SARS, but it is much more transmissible and affects older people than young people and more men than women.
In response to the growing number of publications on emerging disease, the purpose of this article is to provide a timely and comprehensive analysis of the research topic, which is being developed rapidly.
We will address the basic aspects of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and disease prevention.
Although many questions have not yet answered, we hope that this analysis will help to understand and eradicate this threatening disease.
The Spring Festival of 25 January 2020 has become an inaudible memory for all Chinese, who were urged to stay home throughout the holiday and for several more weeks due to the outbreak of a new viral disease.
The virus has almost the same name as coronavirus (COV) that caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, on 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) called SARS-COV-2, and the associated disease was called coronaryvirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China and spread rapidly across the country and almost 50 more countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus has caused more than 80 000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients discharged and more than 3000 patients died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is the “public enemy number” and is potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 scientific articles have been published on COVID-19, including its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report of 7 January 2020, which determined the sequence of the isolated virus of multiple patients.
The aim of this analysis is to summarize the progress made in research into this new subject that is being developed rapidly.
When possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another disease caused by a COV, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, an outbreak in 2012).
We will also examine what is known so far about the prevention and prognosis of the disease, as well as some crucial questions that have not yet been answered.
Coronaviruses have traditionally been considered non-lethal pathogens for humans, mainly causing about 15% of the common colds 4.
However, in this century, we have met twice with highly pathogen coronaviruses in humans, namely SARS-COV and MERS-COV, which caused an outbreak originally in China, in 2003, and Saudi Arabia, in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other countries with appalling morbidity and mortality.
Therefore, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is the third by coronavirus of which is recorded in the history of humanity.
As shown in Fig. Fig. 1, 1, unknown-origin pneumonia conglomerates were first reported on 31 December 2019 by Wuhan to the China National Health Commission.
Seven days later, the coronavirus sequence became known.
On 15 January 2020, the first fatal case was recorded in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to cities, provinces and neighbouring countries.
On 20 January, the infection of health care providers was reported, suggesting that inter-human transmission was possible.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was quarantined and all public transport was suspended.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on the disease reported that, of the 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market that was considered the site of origin of infection of an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, WHO declared a global health emergency at the outbreak.
At the date of this report, the disease has already spread throughout China and almost 50 more countries around the world (fig. (fig. 2).
As the situation evolves rapidly, the final dimension and severity of the outbreak still cannot be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multicenter study of 8866 patients, including 4021 patients with COVID-19 confirmed, presented a more up-to-date illustration of the epidemic described below (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but mainly people aged 30 to 65.
Almost half (47.7%) of the infected people were over 50 years old, very few were under 20 and only 14 were under 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 more infected men (0.31/100 000) than women (0.27/100 000).
The COVID-19 expanded into conglomerates mostly in Hubei and its surroundings.
On average, 5 days (2 to 9) elapsed between the occurrence and diagnosis of VOC-19.
The mean incubation period was 4.8 days (between 3.0 and 7.2).
The average time from appearance to death was 9.5 days (between 4.8 and 13).
The basic reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of people infected increased exponentially before January 23, 2020, which coincides with the era of mass mobilization prior to the Spring Day in China.
The mortality of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10%-1.86%), and the adjusted mortality of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for CVID-19 were gender (male), age (≥60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large and wrapped viruses that contain a unique sense chain RNA.
They can be divided into four genera, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alphacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus are the ones that infect humans.
The spiga (S) glycoprotein of the wrapper binds to its cell receptors, the angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptide 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-COV respectively, and then membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released to the cytoplasm; after the replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA, along with the glycoproteins of the envelope and the proteins of the nucleopsidus, forms vesicles containing virions, which then fuse with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first gene sequence of SARS-COV-2 was announced on 10 January 2020.
It was found that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of betacoronavirus with a genetic identity of more than 99.98 % in 10 sequenced samples taken from the original outbreak site: the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.
SARS-COV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-COV than MERS-COV.
With an electronic transmission microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in ultra-delated sections of the human respiratory epithelium.
Human ACE2 was determined to be a recipient of SARS-COV-2, as well as SARS-COV.
However, SARS-COV-2 S protein binds to human ACE2 more weakly than SARS-COV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-COV-2 causes a less serious infection in patients than SARS-COV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein coded by orf3b and a secreted protein coded by orf8.
The orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 could have a function in viral pathogenicity and inhibit IFNβ expression; however, the orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or motif.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al., revealed the electronic cryomicroscopy structure of the ACE2 human complete length in resolution 2.9 Å, in complex with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They discovered that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was assembled as a dimer, and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can unite two S proteins, which provides evidence for the recognition and infection of the coronavirus.
B0AT1 could become a therapeutic target for drug study to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The origin and the intermediate guest
It is known that SARS-COV and MERS-COV originated in bats and were transmitted to humans through civets and camels, respectively.
In a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-COV-2 with other coronaviruses, bats were considered to be the native host of SARS-COV-2, since the new virus is identical in 96 % to two coronaviruses similar to SARS of bat-SL-COVZX45 bat-SL-COVZ21.
However, it is still unknown which intermediate host helped the virus cross the barrier of species to infect humans, and remains to dilucidate the transmission route.
Ji, et al., proposed snakes as carriers of the bat virus to humans, which involved homologous recombination within the protein S.
According to one study, researchers from Guangzhou, China, suggested that pangolines (long-hoc mammals that feed on ants and usually use in traditional Chinese medicine) are a possible intermediate SARS-COV-2 host based on a 99% genetic homology in a coronavirus discovered in pangolines and SARS-COV-2.
However, a 1% difference propagated by the whole of two genomes remains a major difference; therefore, conclusive results are expected to provide concrete evidence (fig. (Fig. 33).
The physicochemical properties of SARS-COV-2 are still widely unknown.
SARS-COV and MERS-COV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at less than 20 °C with a humidity of 40-50 %.
SARS-CoV-2 might have similar properties.
SARS-COV-2 has been reported to be sensitive to ultraviolet rays and to heat at 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol at 75%, chlorine disinfectant, perchloric acid, chloroform and other fat solvents, but not chlorohexidine, are effective in disabling the virus.
The entire human population in general lacks immunity to SARS-COV-2 and therefore is susceptible to the new coronavirus.
So far, no detailed study on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 has been announced.
Therefore, we can only resort to previous studies with other coronaviruses, especially SARS-COV and MERS-COV (fig. (fig. 4).
In general, after the virus invades the host, it is first recognized by the innate immune system of the host through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including C-type lectins receptors, Toll-type receptors (TLRs), NOD-type receptors (NLRs) and RIG-I (RLRs).
Through different pathways, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of interferons type I (IFN) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophagic phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, SARS-CoV N protein can help the virus escape immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response joins in the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce specific antibodies to the virus, and CD8+ T cells directly kill virus infected cells.
Co-operating T cells produce proinflammatory cytokines to assist defense cells.
However, coronaviruses can inhibit T-cell functions by inducing T-cell apoptosis.
Humor immunity, which includes supplements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, is also essential for combating viral infection.
For example, isolated antibodies from a recovered patient neutralized the MERS-COV.
On the other hand, an exaggerated reaction of the immune system locally generates a large number of free radicals that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst case, multiorganic failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by the occurrence of conglomerates, is more likely to affect older people with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is common for people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised to be more likely to become infected than others.
The estimated mean incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1 to 14 days, mostly between 3 and 7 days, according to a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a 1099 case study shows that the incubation period was 3 days on average and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, shows that the incubation period was 4.8 days (between 3.0 and 7.2) based on the demographics of 8866 cases.
It is very important that the health authorities adapt the effective quarantine time according to the most accurate incubation period; this is how asymptomatic infected persons will be expected to transmit the virus to others.
As a usual practice, people exposed to the virus or infected should normally remain quarantined for 14 days.
Should quarantine be extended to 24 days?
The fever is usually the main and initial symptom of the COVID-19, which may be accompanied by no other symptoms or other symptoms such as dry cough, dysne, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, throat pain, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients had dyspnea or hypoxemia one week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients evolved rapidly to develop acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with respiratory fever or symptoms and acute fever, even without pulmonary abnormalities in imaging studies, should be tested for early diagnosis.
A demographic study at the end of December 2019 indicated that the percentages of symptoms were 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnea and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients required respiratory assistance.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies of a family conglomerate and a conglomerate caused by the transmission of an asymptomatic person.
Comparably, a 2012 demographic study showed that patients with MERS-CoV also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnoea (55%) as major symptoms.
However, 80% of them required respiratory assistance, much more than patients with COVID-19 and in line with the MERS' highest lethality with respect to COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in patients with MRS.
In patients with SARS, it was shown that fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhea (20%-25%) and sore throat (13%-25%) were the main symptoms and respiratory assistance was needed in approximately 14% to 20% of patients.
By 14 February, the mortality of COVID-19 was 2% when the confirmed cases reached 66,576 worldwide.
Similarly, the mortality of SARS for November 2002 was 10% in 8096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, according to a demographic study in June 2012, mortality was 37 % in 2494 confirmed cases.
In a previous study, R0 of SARS-COV-2 was reported to be high and to 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) from 5.71 to 7.23, while the SARS-COV R0 ranged from 2 to 4.
A comparison of SARS-COV-2 with MERS-COV and SARA-COV in terms of symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The above figures suggest that SARS-COV-2 has a greater propagation capacity than MERS-COV and SARS-COV, but its lethality is lower than that of the latter two.
Therefore, it is much harder to control the SARS-COV-2 epidemic than MERS-COV and SARS-COV.
The occurrence in conglomerates usually occurs within one family or from the same meeting or vehicle, such as a cruise.
Patients usually have a history of travel or residency in Wuhan and other affected areas or contact with infected persons or patients within two weeks prior to the occurrence.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and that patients discharged from the hospital may contract the virus again, an alarm signal that quarantine time should be increased.
Patients have a normal or reduced amount of white blood cells in the peripheral blood (especially lymphocytes) at the early stage.
For example, lymphopenia was observed with a white blood cell count of <4×109/l, including a count of lymphocytes of <1×109/l, and elevated levels of aminotransferase aspartate in 1099 patients with COVID-19.
Liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin were elevated in the blood of some patients, and reactive C protein and erythrocytic sedimentation were elevated in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the level of dimer-D, a product of the degradation of fibrin in the blood, was high, and the count of lymphocytes was progressively reduced.
Anomaly in chest X-rays are detected in most patients with COVID-19, characterized by shadow or bilateral emerald glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients usually develop an atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA).
When SDRA occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis seriously affect gas exchange.
The dysfunction of type I and type II pneumocytes decreases the level of surfactant and increases the surface tension, which reduces the ability of the lungs to expand and increases the risk of lung collapse.
As a result, the worst findings in chest X-rays are usually in parallel with the maximum severity of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the desquamation of the pneumocytes, the formation of a hyalin membrane and infiltration of lymphocytes in the interstitium, and multinucleated sincial cells in the lungs of a patient who died from the disease, which is consistent with the pathology of viral infection and SDRA, and similar to that of patients with SARS and MERS.
The detection of SARS-COV-2 RNA by a polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcriptase (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which could accelerate the epidemic, the clinical manifestations for diagnosis (which was no longer based solely on RT-PCR) were used in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation also occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological findings is essential and imperative for effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol for using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to detect SARS-COV-2, which detects synthetic fragments of SARS-COV-2 RNA between 20 × 10-18 mol/l and 200 × 10-18 mol/l (10-100 copies per microliter sample) using a graduated wand in less than an hour that does not require complex instruments.
Fortunately, the new technique can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience if it is found in clinical samples.
Due to the lack of experience with the new coronavirus, physicians can mostly provide support care to patients with COVID-19, while at the same time proving with a variety of therapies that have been used or previously proposed for the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-COV, and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include treatment currently in use or potential with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma of recovered patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
It was even proposed to use the plasma of recovered patients for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies compete to see who first develops antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-COV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at first and probably also attacks, to a lesser degree, other organs that express ACE2, such as digestive apparatus and kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and insufficiency are the greatest threat to patients and the main cause of death.
Therefore, respiratory assistance is critical to alleviate symptoms and save lives, and includes general oxygen therapy, high-flowing oxygen, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation according to the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (OMEC), a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique that is used for the treatment of potentially fatal heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shocks, and protecting vital organs functions are also essential in patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It is known that the cytokines storm is the result of an exaggerated reaction of the immune system in patients with SARS and MERS.
Cytocin storm is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release an enormous number of free radicals that are the main cause of the SDRA and multi-organic failure.
Immunosuppression is essential for the treatment of cytokines storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, a monoclonal anti-receptor antibody of IL6, have been used to treat the cytokines storm.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for the cytokines storm are the modulation of the T-cell-led immune response; the blockade of IFN-γ, IL-1 and TNF; the inhibition of JAK; blinatumomab; a suppressor of the cytokines signalling pathway 4 and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosuppressors, were widely used in SARS treatment to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, steroids at high doses were not beneficial for serious lung lesions in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
On the other hand, they can cause serious side effects, particularly osteonecrosis, which affects the prognosis significantly.
However, prudent use of corticosteroids in low to moderate doses over a short period of time for patients with COVID-19 in critical condition has been recommended.
At the time of this analysis, the effectiveness of any antiviral therapy has not been confirmed.
However, the efficacy of remedivative, a nucleotide analogue, administered intravenously in an American patient with COVID-19, has been proven.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead initially for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg virus.
Subsequently, remdesivir also demonstrated the potential to inhibit other monocatenary RNA viruses, such as MERS and SARS.
Based on these, Gilead has provided the compound to China to carry out a couple of tests in people infected with SARS-COV-2, and there is great expectation for the results.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon alfa, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been suggested as possible therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur after therapy combined with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other drugs used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma of recovered patients and antibody generation
The blood extraction of patients who recovered from a contagious disease to treat other patients who contracted the same disease or to protect healthy people from contracting the disease is not something new.
In fact, recovered patients usually have a relatively high level of antibodies to the blood pathogen.
The antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign objects, and recognize certain molecules in pathogens and neutralize them directly.
On this basis, plasma was extracted from the blood of a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 and injected into 10 seriously ill patients.
Its symptoms improved in 24 hours, accompanied by a reduction in inflammation and viral loads and a better saturation of oxygen in the blood.
However, it is necessary to verify and clarify this in order to propose the method for large-scale use until specific therapies are developed.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some plasma-associated disadvantages should be considered carefully.
For example, antibodies may overstimulate the immune response and cause cytokines release syndrome, possibly leading to fatal toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and plasma demand is high to treat patients in critical condition.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies with sufficient speed to combat a global pandemic.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from recovered patients and identify genetic codes that encode effective antibodies or seek effective antibodies against the essential proteins of the virus.
In this way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
MCT has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases in China.
However, its effects largely depend on a combination of several components in a formula that varies according to the diagnosis of a disease according to the theories of the MCT.
Most effective components remain unknown or inaccurate, since it is difficult to extract and verify such components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific therapy for COVID-19, CMD has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for those who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, it was determined that Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules are effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
The main rates of recovery in the treatment of patients with CVID-19 were observed in several provinces of China who used TCM in 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50 %) and Hunan (50 %), while the province of Hubei, which used TCM in only about 30% of its patients with CVID-19, had the lowest rate of recovery (13%).
However, this is a fairly approximate comparison, as many other impact factors, such as patient quantity and severity, should be included in the evaluation.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and his colleagues published a study comparing the treatment of western medicine (MO) only with the combined treatment of MO and MCT.
They found that the time needed for the recovery of body temperature, the disappearance of symptoms and hospitalization were significantly lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO+MCT group only.
What is more surprising, the rate of worsening symptoms (from mild to severe) was significantly lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group only (7.4% versus 46.2%) and mortality was lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group only (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of the TCM is still awaiting further well-controlled trials at larger scales and in more centres.
It would also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of the actions and to determine the effective components of the treatments of the MCT or their combinations if possible.
Patients with suspicion or confirmation of COVID-19 are generally very afraid of highly contagious and even deadly disease, and people in quarantine also experience boredom, loneliness and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as the adverse effects of treatments, such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, can lead to more anxiety and mental distress.
In the early phase of SARS outbreak, a number of psychiatric morbidity were reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitation, psychotic symptoms, delirium and even suicidal tendencies.
The tracking of contacts and mandatory quarantine, as part of the public health responses to the outbreak of COVID-19, can make people feel more nervous and guilty about the effects of contagion, quarantine and stigma on their family and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to patients with COVID-19, to persons with suspicion and to persons in contact with them, as well as to the general public who need it.
Psychological support should include the formation of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communications with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-COV-2 outbreak and treatment plans and the use of electronic devices and professional applications to avoid close contact between people.
Effective vaccines are essential to interrupt the transmission chain of infected animal and human reservoirs to susceptible guests, and often complement antiviral treatment in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop protein-based S vaccines to generate powerful and long-term neutralizing antibodies or immunity that protect against SARS-COV.
Atenuated live virus vaccines have been evaluated in animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these possible vaccines in older people and lethal stimulation models and their protection against zoonotic-derived virus infection should still be determined before a clinical study is started.
This is probably because SARS was extinct 17 years ago and no new cases have been registered since.
On the other hand, there are still cases and conglomerates of MERS sporadicly in the Middle East that are propagated to other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using disabled viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for non-immune people is an urgent and decisive task to control the ongoing pandemic.
However, it is difficult to overcome the difficulties due to the long period (18 months on average) necessary for the development of a vaccine and the dynamic variations of the coronaviruses.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has recently begun to manifest its complete clinical course in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover gradually without sequelae.
However, as with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, creating a health forecast model is essential so that health agencies can prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients with CVID-19 (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor for SARS forecast, which was also successful for COVID-19.
CVID-19 occurred mostly in people aged 30 to 65 and 47.7% of these patients were over 50 years of age in a study of 8866 cases, as described above.
Patients requiring intensive care most likely had comorbidities and underlying complications and were considerably greater than those who did not require them (meaning 66 versus 51), suggesting that age is a predictor of the evolution of patients with CVID-19.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100 000 versus 0.27/100 000), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: patients with CVID-19 who require intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute cardiac injury and arrhythmia.
Heart events were also the leading cause of death in patients with SARS.
It has been reported that SARS-COV-2 may also join positive ACE2 collangocytes, which may lead to liver dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It should be noted that the age and underlying diseases are strongly correlated and may interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: the level of C-reactive protein (RCP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and has been proposed as a possible prognosis factor for the disease, response to therapy and final recovery.
In addition, the correlation between the level of PCR and the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 has been proposed.
In addition, a high level of dehydrogenase lactate (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) can also help predict patient evolution.
These enzymes are intensely expressed in several organs, especially the heart and liver, and are released when the tissue is damaged.
Therefore, they are traditional markers of cardiac or hepatic dysfunction.
Major clinical symptoms: chest X-ray and temporal progression of clinical symptoms should be considered together with other symptoms for predicting clinical outcomes and complications of CVID-19.
Use of steroids: as previously described, steroids are immunosuppressants that are commonly used as adjuvant therapy for infectious diseases in order to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since the use of high doses of corticosteroids was widespread in patients with severe SARS, many survivors developed avascular osteonecrosis with permanent disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used in low doses and for a short period in patients with COVID-19.
Mental stress: as described above, during the outbreak of COVID-19, many patients have suffered extraordinary stress, as they generally endured long periods of quarantine and extreme uncertainty, and witnessed the death of close relatives and other patients.
It is essential to provide psychotherapy and long-term support to these patients to help them recover from stress and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies conducted so far, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics than SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower airways, SARS-COV-2 can be efficiently replicated in the upper airways and causes mild or non-symptoms in the early phase of infection, as is the case with other coronaviruses that cause common colds.
Therefore, patients infected at an early stage or during incubation may produce a large amount of viruses during their daily activities, which greatly hinders the control of the epidemic.
However, transmission of SARS-CoV was considered to occur when patients were seriously ill, while transmission mostly did not occur in the early phase.
Therefore, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more serious and difficult to control than the outbreak of SARS.
Major efforts are currently being made in China, including the closure of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the continued quarantine of almost the entire population in hopes of interrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures are causing significant damage to the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is declining, indicating the deceleration of the epidemic.
According to the most optimistic forecast, the outbreak will have ended by March and the downward phase will last for 3 or 4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimated that COVID-19, which appears to be considerably more infectious than SARS, will not end by 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., created a model to predict the evolution of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
One Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in both nasal and pharyngeal exudates in patients who had recovered and had left the hospital 2 weeks earlier, indicating that the newly identified virus could become an influenza-like cyclic episode.
However, promising signs have been seen in China given the decrease in the number of new cases, indicating that current strategies could be working.
It was originally predicted that Ebola would cause up to one million cases with half a million deaths.
However, through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease has been controlled.
Like SARS-CoV, SARS-COV-2 may be weakened in terms of infectivity and eventually extinguishes or becomes a less pathogenic virus than coexists with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with that of SARS and MERS is given below (fig. (fig. 55).
SARS-COV-2 is highly transmissible through cough or sneezing, and possibly also through direct contact with virus-contaminated materials.
The virus was also detected in faeces, which poses a new possibility of fecal-oral transmission.
A recent 138-case study reported that 41% of cases may have been caused by nosocomy infections, including 17 patients with other previous diseases and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, precautions should be taken to protect humans, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues and, even, passersby in contact with patients or infected persons.
The first line of defense that could be used to reduce the risk of infection is the use of masks; the use of surgical masks and masks with N95 respirator (series number 1860) helps control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent liquid droplets of a potentially infected person from being transmitted by air or attached to the surfaces, from which they could be transmitted to other persons.
However, only N95 masks (series number 1860) can protect against inhalation of virions as small as 10 to 80 nm, and only 5% of virions can penetrate them completely; SARS-COV-2 is similar to SARS-COV in size and both measure about 85 nm.
Since particles can penetrate up to five stacked surgical masks, medical care providers in direct contact with patients should use N95 masks (series number 1860) and not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, medical care providers should use custom insulation robes to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor infected SARS-CoV-2 despite using a N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Medical care providers should therefore also use protective care or transparent glasses while working with patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is strongly suggested that the population wash their hands with disinfectant soaps more followed by the usual, try to stay at home in voluntary quarantine and limit contact with people who may be infected.
Three feet are considered to be an adequate distance for people to stay away from a patient.
These measures are effective methods of reducing the risk of infection and preventing the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-COV-2 appeared as a new virus for the human world, its high homology with SARS-COV, as reported on January 7, 2020, should have caused great alert in China for its experience with SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, it was not until 19 January 2020 that the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control reassured citizens that the new virus had low contagion and limited reproductive capacity among humans, and that there would be no problem preventing and containing the disease.
This message greatly relaxed the alarm of the public, especially at a time when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical moment was wasted to contain the disease at a minimum level in Wuhan.
China's disease control agencies should learn from this hard lesson and adopt decisive improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should be (1) more cautious when making public announcements, as every word matters for citizens and may change their attitude or decisions; (2) more sensitive and reactive to unusual information from clinics, rather than waiting for formal reports from doctors or officials; (3) more restrictive to contain a possible epidemic at its early stage, rather than trying to reassure the public; and (4) more regular in implementing adapted and effective simulations to increase public awareness of epidemic diseases and to test and improve the society's response system periodically.
The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the new SARS-COV-2 virus began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China and some 50 more countries around the world at the time of this analysis.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-COV and there are also many similarities between the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS, the outbreak of COVID-19 has generated the recurrence sensation of SARS.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential to contain the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and more men than women, and severity and mortality are also higher in older people than in young people.
SARS has a greater mortality than COVID-19 (10.91 % versus 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 transmit the virus although they do not have symptoms, whereas patients with SARS usually do so when they are seriously ill, which creates a much greater difficulty in holding the spread of COVID-19 compared to SARS.
This explains, in part, why SARS-CoV-2 spread much faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA testing for SARS-COV-2 may be negative in some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, cured patients can be positive in the virus again.
These results dramatically increase the risk of spread of the virus.
Given the rapid progress made in the investigation of COVID-19, a number of important issues remain to be resolved, such as:
Where did SARS-COV-2 come from?
Although 96 % of genetic homology was found between SARS-COV-2 and two mutilation coronaviruses similar to SARS, it is still not possible to conclude that SARS-COV-2 comes from bats.
What animal was the intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original host, say, bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to number 1 and 2, it is not possible to stop transmission efficiently, and the outbreak can resurgence at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-COV-2 binds to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter the respiratory tract cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to cells that express ACE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is not possible to achieve a rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically while being transmitted among humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, become extinct like SARS or resurgence periodically as the flu?
While it may take some time, it is essential to seek answers to these and many other questions.
However, whatever it takes, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to our normal life.
Zoonotic sources of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have spurred the co-evolution of the coronaviruses and their guests, including human beings, for thousands of years.
Until 2003, it was known that two human coronaviruses caused mild diseases, such as common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have invested the coin in revealing how devastating and deadly an infection by human coronavirus can be.
The emergence of SARS-COV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 put the coronaviruses in the attention center again and surprised us with high transmissibility and reduced pathogenicity compared to their brother, SARS-COV.
Human coronavirus infection is a zoonosis and we would be useful to know the zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses.
Most human coronaviruses have their origin in bats, in which they are not pathogens.
Guests of intermediate reservoirs of some human coronavirus are also known.
Identifying animal guests has direct implications for the prevention of disease in humans.
Investigating the interactions between coronavirus and animal guests could also shed important information on the pathogenesis of coronavirus in humans.
In this analysis, we present a general description of the existing knowledge about the seven human coronaviruses, with emphasis on the history of their discovery, as well as their zoonotic origins and transmission among species.
Notably, we compare and contrast the different human coronaviruses from the perspective of the evolution of the virus and the recombination of the genome.
The current disease epidemic by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is analyzed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for successful guest changes and the implications of the evolution of the virus in the severity of the disease are also highlighted.
Coronaviruses belong to the Coronaviridae family, which includes a positive monocatenary RNA virus group with wrapper.
These viruses, which house the largest genome, from 26 to 32 kilobases, among RNA viruses, were called \"coronaviruses\" because of their morphology, by the form of crown they have under an electron microscope.
As for its structure, coronaviruses have unsegmented genomes that share a similar organization.
About two-thirds of the genome contains two large open-reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which translate into the replication polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab.
Polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 non-structural proteins, called nsp1~16.
The remaining part of the genome contains ORF for structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
A number of protein accessories specific to each lineage are also coded by different coronavirus lines.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, coronaviruses are classified into four genera (alphacoronavirus, betacoronavirus, gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus), among which the genus betacoronavirus contains the majority of human coronavirus and is subdivided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
The phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents are the source of genes of most alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus, while birds are the main reservoir of gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus.
For thousands of years, coronaviruses have constantly crossed the barriers of species and some have emerged as important human pathogens.
To date, seven human coronaviruses are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alphacoronavirus.
The other five beta-coronaviruses are HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV), coronavirus of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-COV) and SARS-COV-2.
HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms such as common cold or diarrhea.
On the other hand, SARS-COV, MERS-COV and the newly identified SARS-COV-2 are highly pathogenic and cause severe infection of the lower airways in a relatively larger number of patients, with a higher likelihood of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (DSRA) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from nasal secretion of patients with common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been accumulated through comprehensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCOV-OC43, which cause self-limited symptoms.
In fact, up to the outbreak of SARS, it was a widely accepted concept that coronavirus infection of humans is usually harmless.
The SARS outbreak that occurred in 2003 is one of the most devastating in current history and infected more than 8000 people, with a crude lethality of about 10%.
Ten years later, the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) resulted in a persistent epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic spread to the rest of the world.
The new 2019 human coronavirus (2019-nCoV), later known as SARS-COV-2, is the cause agent of the ongoing disease epidemic by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), which has been charged more than 3120 lives and has infected more than 91,000 people by 3 March 2020.
The alarm has been ringing and the world must prepare for the approaching SARS-COV-2 pandemic.
The seven human coronaviruses have a zoonotic origin in bats, mice or domestic animals.
Several lines of evidence support the evolutionary origin of all human coronaviruses in bats, in which viruses are well adapted and not pathogens, but present great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has posed enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges in China and the rest of the world.
Tracking the zoonotic origins of human coronavirus provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving force and the factors of restriction of jumping among species.
This could also guide or facilitate the search for the reservoir and the intermediate animal guests and amplifiers of SARS-COV-2, which would have important implications for preventing the spread in the future.
In this analysis, we present a general description of zoonotic origins, the transmission between species and the pathogenesis of human coronaviruses.
In particular, we highlight and analyze the common theme that the parental viruses of human coronaviruses are usually not pathogens in their guests of natural reservoir, but become pathogens after transmission between species to a new host.
We also examine the evolution trend of human coronaviruses, in which increased transmissibility usually leads to decreased pathogenicity.
The evolution of the ongoing outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 is also analysed in this context.
The coronaviruses of animals have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the B814 strain of HCoV-229E was first isolated from the nasal secretion of patients who had contracted a common cold, different coronaviruses had been isolated in different infected animals, such as turkey, mouse, cow, pig, cat and dog.
In recent decades, seven human coronaviruses have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of the discoveries of human coronaviruses in chronological order (Table 1) would be informative and instructive.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated from the airways of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966 and subsequently adapted to grow in cellular lines WI-38 of the lung.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E had symptoms of common cold, such as headache, sneezing, general discomfort and throat pain, with fever and cough in 10~20% of the cases.
Later, in 1967, the HCOV-OC43 was isolated from organ cultivation and the later serial pass in lactating mice' brains.
The clinical characteristics of HCOV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those caused by HCOV-229E, whose symptoms are identical to those of infections by other respiratory pathogens, such as influenza A and rhinovirus viruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed throughout the world and tend to be broadcast predominantly during the winter season, in temperate climates.
In general, the incubation time of these two viruses is less than a week, followed by a period of disease of about 2 weeks.
According to a study with human volunteers, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E developed a mild common cold.
Only some immunocompromised patients had a serious infection of the lower airways.
SARS, also known as atypical pneumonia, caused the first pandemic caused by a well-documented human coronavirus in the history of humanity, and the etiologic agent is SARS-CoV, the third human coronavirus that was discovered.
The first case of SARS dates back to late 2002 in the province of Guangdong, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8096 cases reported with 774 deaths and spread across many countries and continents.
Apart from the superpropagators, it was estimated that each case could cause approximately two secondary cases, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and the occurrence of the maximum viral load at the tenth day of disease.
Patients infected with SARS-COV initially have myalgia, headache, fever, general discomfort and chills, followed by dyspnea, cough and respiratory distress as late symptoms.
Lymphopenia, altered liver function and elevated level of creatine kinase are common abnormal results in SARS laboratory tests.
Diffuse alveolar damage, proliferation of epithelial cells and an increase in macrophages are also observed in patients with SARS.
Approximately 20-30% of patients subsequently require intensive care and mechanical respiratory assistance.
In addition to lower airways, several organs, including the gastrointestinal tube, liver, and kidney, can also be infected in these serious cases, usually accompanied by a cytokine storm, which could be fatal, particularly in immunodepressed patients.
The virus was first isolated from the open-air lung biopsy of a family member of the initial patient who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, enormous efforts have been made to investigate human coronaviruses.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
Initially, it was found to be prevalent in young children, older adults and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
Coriza, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis are common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from a nasal sample taken from an 8-month-old child suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was identified in the Netherlands, it is actually distributed throughout the world.
HCoV-NL63 has been estimated to cause approximately 4.7 % of common respiratory diseases, and its maximum incidence occurs early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as the crup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to community-acquiolysis, HCoV-HKU1 was reported to be associated with acute exacerbations of asthma.
Like HCOV-NL63, HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 were worldwide, causing mild respiratory diseases.
These four acquired human coronaviruses in the community have adapted well to humans and are generally less likely to mutate to cause highly pathogenic diseases, although there have been accidents due to unknown causes, such as in the rare case of a more virulent subtype of HCoV-NL63, which has recently been reported to have caused serious infection of lower respiratory tract in China.
In general, when these human coronaviruses acquire the ability to transmit efficiently and remain continuously in humans, they also become less virulent or pathogen.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient who had developed acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most of the cases confirmed in the laboratory are originating in the Middle East, there have been cases imported occasionally into close contacts in several European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The MERS clinical manifestations are similar to those of SARS, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MRS also developed acute renal failure, which so far only occurs with MRS among diseases caused by human coronavirus.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As at 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 confirmed cases were recorded in the laboratory, with a high mortality of 34.4%, making MERS-COV one of the most devastating viruses for humans known to be.
From mid-December 2019, conglomerates of patients with pneumonia were detected in Wuhan, province of Hubei, China, which retrospectively associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The World Health Organization declared the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-COV-2 an emergency of international importance public health and also called the disease COVID-19.
As at 3 March 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a crude mortality of 3,4%.
Notably, the lethality in Hubei, China, is 4.2%, while outside it is 1.2%.
SARS-COV-2 causes severe respiratory infection, such as SARS-COV and MERS-COV, which is presented as fever, cough and dysne.
Diarrhea has also been observed in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can rapidly evolve into acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2 are very similar due to a high nucleotide sequence homology of 82 %, they are classified into different branches of the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-COV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but more transmissible compared to SARS-COV and MERS-COV.
Cases of asymptomatic individuals infected with SARS-COV-2 have been reported, which could contribute to their rapid spread throughout the world.
When comparing and contrasting SARS-COV-2 with the other six human coronaviruses, similarities and differences of great interest are identified.
First of all, the incubation period and the duration of the course of human coronavirus disease are very similar.
In this respect, SARS-COV-2 follows the general trend of the other six human coronaviruses.
Secondly, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 is between SARS-COV and the four acquired human coronaviruses in the community (i.e. HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-COV-2 infection presents characteristics that are most commonly observed in coronavirus infections of acquired humans in the community, including non-specific or mild symptoms, or even the absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, there is also a small subgroup of serious cases of COVID-19 as is the case with SARS-COV infection, although the relationship is a little smaller.
Thirdly, the transmission of SARS-COV-2 also shows interesting patterns characteristic of both coronaviruses of humans acquired in the community and SARS-COV.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is, at least, as high as that of the coronaviruses of humans acquired in the community.
On the other hand, it remains to verify whether the transmissibility of SARS-COV-2 decreases after human passage, as is the case with SARS-COV and MERS-COV.
Finally, as with other human coronaviruses, SARS-COV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.
If the fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 performs an important function, as in the case of SARS-CoV, at least in some circumstances, it should still be diluted in future studies.
It is also of particular interest to find out whether SARS-COV-2 could exhibit seasonality, as is the case with the coronaviruses of humans acquired in the community.
However, the characteristics of SARS-COV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable propagation after human passage, will have an influence on the final outcome of the current outbreak of COVID-19.
The four acquired human coronaviruses in the community that cause mild symptoms have adapted well to humans.
From another perspective, it might also be true that humans have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, both could be survivors of old human coronavirus pandemics.
Coronaviruses have been eliminated from humans causing severe human and human diseases that have developed severe human coronary virus diseases.
In order for this to happen, human coronaviruses must be replicated in humans to a sufficient extent to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that counter the restriction factors of the host.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-COV-2 outbreak persists and the more people infect, the greater the likelihood that it will be fully adapted to humans.
If adapted well, its transmission in humans would be difficult to stop by quarantine or other infection control measures.
For many years, the four coronaviruses acquired in the community have circulated in human populations and have caused common colds in immunocompetent people.
These viruses don't need an animal reservoir.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-COV and MERS-COV have not adapted well to humans and their transmission among humans is unsustainable.
They need to be maintained and propagated in their zoonotic reservoirs and seek the opportunity to spread to susceptible human objectives, possibly through one or more intermediate guests and amplifiers.
SARS-COV-2 has similar characteristics to both SARS-COV and MERS-COV as well as the four acquired human coronaviruses in the community.
It is highly transmissible as the coronaviruses of humans acquired in the community, at least for the moment.
However, it is more pathogenic than the coronaviruses of humans acquired in the community and less pathogen than SARS-COV or MERS-COV.
It remains to be seen whether it will fully adapt to humans and circulate among humans without an animal reserve or intermediate host.
Before analyzing the animal origins of human coronaviruses, we will find it helpful to examine the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate and amp of human coronaviruses.
An animal acts as an evolutionary host of a human coronavirus if it hosts a closely related ancestor that shares a high homology at the nucleotide sequence.
The ancestral virus is usually well adapted and is not pathogen in this host.
Similarly, a reservatory guest houses a human coronavirus in a continuous and long-term way.
In both cases, guests naturally become infected and are the natural guests of the human coronavirus or their parental virus.
On the other hand, if the human coronavirus was introduced into the intermediate host just before or almost at the same time as its human introduction, it is not well adapted to the new host and is usually pathogen.
The intermediate host can act as the zoonotic source of infection in humans and fulfill the amplified host function by allowing the virus to replicate transiently and then it is transmitted to humans to amplify the scale of infection in humans.
A human coronavirus can cause an infection in the terminal host if it cannot sustain its transmission in the intermediate host.
On the contrary, human coronaviruses can also adapt to the intermediate host and even generate long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate guest becomes a natural reserve guest.
Epidemiological data retrospectively revealed that SARS's initial case had had had contact with hunting animals.
Subsequent seroprevalence investigations indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG compared to that of the general population.
Civettes of masked palm trees (Paguma larvata) and a mapache dog in live animal markets were the first identified carriers of SARS-COV-like viruses that are almost identical to SARS-COV.
This was indirectly backed up by the fact that no more SARS cases were registered after killing all the civets in the markets.
However, it was reported that the civets of wild masked palms or farms without exposure to the markets of live animals were mostly negative in SARS-COV, suggesting that the civets of masked palm trees would only act as intermediate amp, but not as a natural reservoir of SARS-COV.
Notably, since 80 % of the different animals on the Guangzhou markets have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the chances of several species of small mammals acting also as intermediate amplors of SARS-COV cannot be ruled out.
All of them appear to be SARS-CoV terminal guests.
Subsequent searches of SARS-CoV's natural animal host revealed a coronavirus of closely related bats, known as the HKU3 CoV of Rhinolophus related to SARS (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in Chinese herrature bats.
These bats are positive in anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genome sequence.
This and other bat coronavirus share a nucleotide sequence homology of 88-92 % with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for the new concept that bats house emerging pathogens in humans.
Several SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-COV) have also been identified in bats, but none, except one named WIV1, can be isolated as a live virus.
The converting enzyme of angiotensin 2 (ACE2) human is known to be the SARS-CoV receptor.
It was shown that the WIV1 obtained from a fecal sample of bats uses the ACE2 of bats, civets and humans as a receptor to enter the cells.
Amazingly, serums from patients with convalescent SARS were able to neutralize the WIV1.
So far, the WIV1 represents the most closely related ancestry of SARS-COV in bats, which shares a 95% nucleotide sequence homology.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, in general, it is believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parental virus of SARS-COV and that bats are not the immediate reserve host of SARS-COV.
According to phylogenetic analysis, the MERS-CoV is categorized in the same group as the COV-HKU4 bat and the COV-HKU5 bat.
The COV-HKU4 bat and MERS-COV use the same host receptor, dipeptidyl peptide 4 (DPP4) for the virus entry.
The polymerase RNA sequences dependent on MERS-CoV RNA are phylogenetically closer to their beta-coronavirus counterparts identified in Europe and Africa.
So far, there can be no MERS-COV alive in wild bats.
MERS-COV and its closest relative, the COV-HKU25 bat, share a nucleotide sequence homology of only 87 %.
Therefore, the bat might not be the immediate reserve host of MERS-COV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromedarians are seropositive in specific neutralizing MERS-CoV antibodies, as well as camels originating in the Middle East in several African countries.
A MERS-COV that is alive identical to the virus found in humans was isolated from the nasal exudate of drromedaries, which further supports that camels act as guests of the MERS-COV bona fide reservoir.
It should also be noted that mild symptoms were generally observed, but a massive spread of the virus in camels infected for MERS-COV investigations.
Notably, infected camels propagate viruses not only by respiratory means, but also by fecal-oral means, which is also the main route of the spread of bats virus.
However, there are still questions, as many confirmed MERS cases do not have a history of camel contact prior to the occurrence of symptoms, which is reasonably attributed to transmission between humans or unknown transmission pathways involving unrecognised animal species hosting MERS-CoV.
SARS-COV-2 shares a 96.2 % nucleotide homology with a bat coronavirus, RaTG13, an isolated Rhinolophus affinis bat.
As with SARS-COV and MERS-COV, the difference in sequence between SARS-COV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to assign a parental relationship.
In other words, bats may not be SARS-COV-2's immediate reserve guests unless they are in the future virtually identical bat coronaviruses.
Presumably, the intermediate animal guests of SARS-COV-2 should be among the wild species that are sold and killed in the wholesale market for shellfish in Huanan, with which many of the initial cases of COVID-19 were associated, indicating a likely event of transmission from animal to human.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of endangered small mammals, known as pangolines (Javanic Manis), could also host ancestral betacoronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2.
The genomes of this new pangoline coronavirus share a 85-92 % nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-COV-2.
However, they are equally closely related to the RaTG13, with an identity of about 90% at the nucleotide sequence level.
They are grouped into two sublinear viruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a receptor binding domain (RBD) more similar to SARS-CoV-2, with an amino acid sequence identity of 97.4%.
In sharp contrast, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 RBDs are more divergent, despite a higher degree of sequence homology throughout the genome.
A previous study in sick pangolines also reported the detection of viral contigos in lung samples, which prove to be equally related to SARS-COV-2.
This study adopted different methods of manual assembly and healing to generate a partial genome sequence comprising about 86.3% of the complete-length viral genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility that the pangolin is one of the intermediate animal guests of SARS-COV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence that it supports a direct origin in the SARS-COV-2 pangolin due to the divergence of sequence between SARS-COV-2 and the betacoronaviruses related to SARS-COV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-COV-2 and RaTG13 is even lower than the distance between SARS-COV-2 and the betacoronavirus of pangoline related to SARS-COV-2.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-COV-2 in bats, pangolines and other mammals must still be established.
Although the highest sequence homology was found in RBDs between SARS-COV-2 and pangolin, the betacoronaviruses related to SARS-COV-2, SARS-COV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest complete genome sequence homology.
It is highly speculative that the high degree of similarity between the RBDs of pangoline betacoronavirus related to SARS-COV-2 and SARS-COV-2 was due to the convergent evolution mediated by selectivity.
A counter proposal defends a recombination between the betacoronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 in the third species of wild animal.
As a driving force in evolution, recombination is extended between betacoronaviruses.
A conclusion on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-COV-2 has not yet been reached.
In addition to highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, the zoonotic origin of HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-HKU1 were also studied.
The phylogenetic evidence indicated that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E could have originated from mouse coronaviruses, while the parental viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in rodents.
A kronavirus of bats called ARCoV.2 (Cronavirus of the Apalaches Mountains) detected in a tricolor muralago of North America was reported to have a close relationship with the HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, the HCoV-229E was genetically related to another mozambican coronavirus, known as Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, although it has also suspected camels as intermediate guests.
For greater clarity, the knowledge that is so far contained in the animal origins of known human coronaviruses is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
The phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of events in the transmission of human coronavirus between species in history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed between species to infect humans from livestock in 1890, a respiratory infection pandemic was recorded.
The history of transmission between species of HCoV-229E is not known so precisely.
Alcoronaviruses of bats have been found closely related to HCoV-229E.
Among them is an alpacas alphacoronavirus.
Several lines of evidence support the transmission of bat virus to humans directly.
First, unlike the alpacas, humans could have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
Instead, humans have close contact with the alpacas.
Secondly, bat alpha-coronaviruses related to HCoV-229E are diverse and non-pathogens in bats, while alpace alfacoronavirus caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alfacoronavirus has not been found in wild animals.
Therefore, it is not possible to rule out the possibility that alpacas acquire the alphacoronavirus related to HCoV-229E from humans.
In fact, bats are the direct source of pathogens in humans, such as rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it would not be too surprising for bats to transmit HCoV-229E to humans directly.
Alternatively, while bat alpha-coronavirus acts as the genetic acquis of the HCoV-229E, alpacas and dromedaries could act as intermediate guests who transmit viruses to humans, in particular in the case of MERS-COV.
The MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of transmission between species, from bats to dromedars, and from drromedaries to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-COV in bats is discovered with its initial identification, and has also been supported by later findings.
It is evident that bats contribute, with an abundance of virus species, to the exchange of genetic fragments between species and to the transmission between species.
Longevity, densely populated colonies, close social interaction and the great ability to fly are all favorable conditions that make bats the ideal “virus propagator”.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has been introduced into the drromedaries for decades.
It is well adapted to these camels, which have since been an intermediate guest, to be a stable and natural reserve guest.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low rate of mutation in these animals.
Its sporadic transmission to humans is an accident and humans remain a terminal guest of the MERS-COV, since transmission is unsustainable.
Compared to the role of camels in MERS-COV transmission, the role of pangolines, if any, in the transmission of SARS-COV-2 is different.
In particular, pangoline beta-coronaviruses are highly pathogenic in pangolines.
They may be a terminal host of beta-coronaviruses related to SARS-COV-2, as is the case with SARS-COV.
Several transmission possibilities between SARS-CoV-2 species from animals to humans, should be confirmed or discarded in future studies.
First, bats could be the reserve host of a SARS-COV-2-related virus, almost identical to SARS-COV-2.
Humans could share the ecological niche with bats, through the slaughter or coal mining.
Secondly, pangolines could be one of the intermediate amplifying guests in which a SARS-COV-2-related virus had recently been introduced.
Humans contract the virus through slaughter and consumption of hunting meat.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-COV-2.
There is a need for a study of antibodies in domestic and wild animals.
Thirdly, as mentioned earlier, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-COV-2 could have occurred in a third species that has contact with both bats and pangolines.
The search for the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 continues.
Apart from the different types of animal guests, three main factors in viral terms also play an important role in facilitating coronavirus crossing the barriers of species.
First, their relatively high rates of mutation in RNA replication.
Compared to other monocatenary RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rates of the coronaviruses could be considered - moderated - at -high - with an average substitution rate of ~10-4 substitutions per year, per site 2, according to the coronary virus adaptation phase to new guests.
Coronaviruses have an exorribonuclease reading check, whose elimination results in extremely high mutability and attenuation or even inviability.
Interestingly, it is known that the nucleotide analogue remedisive suppresses the replication of coronavirus by inhibiting this exorribonuclease and RNA polymerase dependent RNA.
Remembrance is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents that have been tested in clinical trials.
However, kronavirus mutation rates are about a million times higher than those of its guests.
Furthermore, the mutation rate is usually high when the coronaviruses are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-COV, which has a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-COV-2 is apparently lower, suggesting a higher level of adaptation to humans.
It is to be hoped that it has already adapted to another guest close to humans.
In addition to SARS-COV-2, this also applies to MERS-COV, which is well adapted to the drromedaries.
In theory, genetic drift is unlikely to cause vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 to lose their effectiveness quickly.
Secondly, the long RNA genome of the coronavirus exerts additional plasticity in the modification of the genome for mutations and recombination and thus increases the likelihood of co-evolution between species, which leads to the emergence of new coronaviruses when the appropriate conditions are given.
This is supported by the single copious open reading frameworks and the functions of the proteins encoded towards the 3' direction of the genome.
Thirdly, coronaviruses change randomly and frequently from templates during RNA replication through a single, \"copy-choice\" mechanism.
In a guest acting as a mixing vehicle, the chain change occurs frequently during coronaryvirus RNA transcription.
Complete-length RNA and highly homologous subgenomics could recombinate to generate new coronaviruses.
phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCOV-OC43, as well as in animal coronaviruses, such as bat SL-COV and bat CoV-HKU9.
Virus-hospital interaction in relation to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with the host receptor is another key factor that influences inter-species transmission.
At present, the recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example, which also showed evidence of positive selection in transmission events between species.
Based on the comparative analysis of human and civet SARS-COV isolated strains, SARS-COV is believed to experience rapid adaptation in different guests, particularly with mutations in the S-protein RBD.
In general, the S-protein RBD of a coronavirus interacts with the cell receptor and is strongly selected by the response of the host's antibodies.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is found in amino acids 318 to 510 in S1, which binds to the human ACE2 and its rectifiers for viral entry.
The SARS-CoV RBD is able to recognize the ACE2 receptors of several animals, including bat, civet, mouse and mapache dog, which allows transmission between virus species.
In fact, it was observed that only 6 amino acid residues were different from the isolated strains of human and civet viruses in the RBD and 4 of them are found in the reason for binding the receptor to the ACE2 receptor.
The Civet SARS-COV has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which could increase the affinity of the spin protein interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions could be essential for the adaptation of the virus to humans.
It should be noted that SARS-COV-2 shares the same cellular receptor with SARS-COV.
A 30% difference between SARS-COV-2 and SARS-COV in the S1 unit of S protein implies that the affinity of S protein binding with human ACE2 could have changed.
In fact, an electronic cryomicroscopy study indicates the 10 to 20 times greater affinity of this binding compared to that of human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also be of interest to determine whether any other corrections might be necessary for the transmission of SARS-COV-2.
Surprisingly, the HCoV-NL63 also joins the ACE2, but with a different part of the S.
There are many other human coronavirus receptors, such as aminopeptidase N in HCoV-229E and sialic acid 9-O-acetylated in HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses in humans, after transmission between species from their animal guests.
In addition to cell receptors, the result of transmission between species of human coronavirus is also determined by other factors of dependence and restriction of the host.
The divergence of these host proteins between humans and the guests of natural reservoir of human coronaviruses, such as bats, dromers and rodents, could constitute an obstacle to transmission between species.
Human coronaviruses must usurp the dependency factors of the host and subvert the restriction factors of the host in order for transmission between species to be successful.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of virus-hospital interaction still need to be identified and characterized.
An objective full genome research of the dependency and restriction factors of the host for SARS-COV-2 could be beneficial using advanced CRISPR technology.
New Human Coronavirus Apparition: Let's start from scratch
The diversity of mouse coronaviruses provides numerous opportunities for the emergence of new human coronaviruses.
In this sense, bat coronaviruses act as the genetic acquis of human coronaviruses.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also drive the evolution of human coronaviruses and are two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein coding genes have the potential to drastically modify viral phenotypes.
Among the accessory proteins of SARS-CoV, it has been considered that ORF8 is important in the adaptation to humans, since bat viruses related to SARS-CoV have been isolated, but they have been determined to encode divergent ORF8 proteins.
A 29 characteristic nucleotide elimination of SARS-CoV was found in isolated strains at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This elimination divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is believed to be an adaptive mutation that promotes the change of guests.
In addition, SARS-COV has a possible history of recombination with alpha and gammacoronavirus lines, in which a large number of smaller recombinant regions were identified in RNA-dependent polymerase RNA.
Recombination locations were also identified in nsp9, most of the nsp10 and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the epidemic MERS-CoV suffered recombination events between different lines, which occurred in dromedaria in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-COV and MERS-COV, recombination events have also been observed in other human coronaviruses, in which human coronaviruses are recombined with other animal coronaviruses in their non-structural genes.
It should also be warned that artificial selection can contribute to unwanted changes in viral genomes, which most likely results in the release of the viruses from the selection pressures exerted, for example, by the hospital's immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of a full-length ORF4 in the prototyping strain of HCoV-229E, due to the elimination of two nucleotides.
Although an ORF4 could be observed intact in bat viruses and camels related to HCoV-229E, alpace alfacoronavirus presents an insertion of a single nucleotide, resulting in a change of frame.
Last but not least, the evolution of the new human coronaviruses is also driven by the selection pressure on their reservory guests.
No symptoms were detected or only mild symptoms were detected when bats were infected with coronavirus, indicating mutual adaptation between the coronaviruses and bats.
The bats appear to be well adapted to anatomical and physiological coronaviruses.
For example, defects in the activation of the proinflammatory response in bats effectively reduces the pathology caused by coronaviruses.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in bats is suppressed due to the positive regulation of the NKG2/CD94 natural killer cell inhibitory receptor and the low level of expression of class I molecules of the major histocompatibility complex.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen (ROS) species generated from the high metabolic activity of bats could suppress coronavirus replication and affect the reading check of exorribonuclease, which provides selection pressure for the generation of highly pathogenic virus strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic coronavirus strains could also evolve by recombination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for adaptation to the host.
It is therefore no coincidence that three new human coronaviruses have appeared in the last two decades.
Coronaviruses are not pathogens or cause mild symptoms in their reserve guests, such as bats and camels.
They are strongly replicated without causing a strong immune response from the host.
In this are the secrets of why asymptomatic carriers exist and what causes serious cases of human infection.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to the hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokines storm, in which the stronger the immune response, the more severe the pulmonary damage.
Instead, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response has been dissociated from coronavirus replication.
The same delinking strategy for the immune response could have beneficial effects on anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon response is especially strong in bats.
Therefore, the administration of type I interferon at least at the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of NLRP3 in bats is defective.
According to this reasoning, the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammation with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The appearance of SARS-COV-2 follows the general line leading to the emergence of SARS-COV and MERS-COV.
Although a bat beta-coronavirus has been found that shares a 95 % nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, there is also a bat coronavirus that shares a 96 % nucleotide homology with SARS-COV-2.
Although it has been determined that the civets and other animals on the markets are infected with SARS-COV-like viruses, immediate intermediate guests of SARS-COV-2 have not been identified.
Betacoronaviruses of pangolines have been found to be remarkably homologous to SARS-COV-2, indicating that pangolines could act as one of the intermediate guests or that pangoline betacoronaviruses could contribute gene fragments to the final version of SARS-COV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-COV-2 is made by man, whether deliberately or by accident.
Coronaviruses have recovered prominently due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of coronaviruses in bats and other animals has profoundly changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs of human coronaviruses in human transmission.
Vast evidence has shown that SARS-COV, MERS-COV and SARS-COV-2 originated in bats and are transmitted to humans through intermediate guests.
Since SARS-CoV infection originates in the contact between humans and civilians in the markets, closing the wet markets and killing the civets in them could have been effective in curbing the SARS epidemic.
Following this same reasoning, pangolines should withdraw from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, given the discovery of several beta-coronavirus lines of pangolines closely related to SARS-COV-2.
However, if and how SARS-COV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolines and other mammals remains to be diluted in future research.
On the other hand, the MERS-COV has existed in the dromedaries for a long time.
These camels are an important transport tool, as well as a main source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the local population.
They are widely distributed across the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as was done in China with wild animal markets to prevent the spread of SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2.
To prevent recurrent outbreaks of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop effective MERS-CoV vaccines for camels, in combination with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes that cause outbreaks may appear.
A variety of zoonotic coronaviruses, are circulating in wild state.
In particular, bat coronaviruses with zoonotic potential are very diverse.
There are great possibilities for these zoonotic coronaviruses to evolve and recombin themselves, which would result in the emergence of new coronaviruses that are more transmissible or more deadly in humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
From the bad experiences with SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better plan for preparation and response should be adopted.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until the opportunity to propagate is presented.
Although bats have many characteristics that favor the spread of viruses, human contact opportunities with bats and other wild species can be minimized if the population is educated to get away from them.
Continuous surveillance of mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of coronaviruses and their natural guests, which will be useful to prevent the transmission of animals to humans and future outbreaks.
To conclude, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonoses is for humans to stay away from the ecological niches of the natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.
Several pieces are still missing in the zoonotic origin puzzle of SARS-COV-2.
First, if bats transmit an ancestral SARS-COV-2 virus to pangolines, it will be interesting to analyze in what circumstances bats and pangolines could share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if bats have a more direct role in human transmission, it should be determined how humans come into contact with bats.
Thirdly, if a third mammal acts as the true intermediate host, it should be diluted how it interacts with the different species, including humans, bats and pangolines.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, could be susceptible to SARS-COV-2, experimental monitoring and infection should be carried out.
Whether it is a bat, pangolin or other mammal, SARS-COV-2 or its parenting viruses that are almost identical are expected to be identified in their natural guests in the future.
Continuous research in this area will dilute the evolutionary pathway of SARS-COV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of VOC-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria for the ‘suspected cases’ and ‘confirmed cases’ of COVID-19
On February 6, 2020, our team published a quick advisory guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of infection by the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), and this guideline included our experience and is a good reference for fighting this pandemic worldwide.
However, the disease by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and our knowledge gradually increase on the basis of the results of ongoing research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our guideline and provide the most recent diagnostic criteria of - suspicious case - and - confirmed case - according to the latest Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 (seventh edition) published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) triggered an outbreak, which is now officially known as the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the virus was called the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO described COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a rapid advisory guideline that was published online in Military Medical Research on February 06, 2020.
It's attracted a lot of attention since it was published.
However, it should be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge gradually increase based on the results of ongoing research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
For example, the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, have published a total of seven editions and some contexts have changed considerably.
Now, our guideline received a comment from Zhou et al., presented a simple classification proposal based on their clinical experience.
His work added new evidence for our guideline and also constitutes a valuable reference for this pandemic worldwide.
We support his important work and express our gratitude.
However, his work also needs update according to the latest Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of VOC-19 (seventh version of the trial) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), in order to confirm a suspicious case, it is necessary to combine any point of epidemiological background with two points of clinical manifestations in order to carry out an exhaustive analysis, or three points of clinical manifestations should be met if there is no clear epidemiological background:
Epidemiological background: (1) history of travel or residency in the city of Wuhan and the surrounding areas, or other communities where cases of CVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with positive nucleic acid test); (3) history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in the city of Wuhan and the surrounding areas, or other communities where cases of CVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the occurrence of symptoms; (4) history of contact with confirmed groups of cases (≥ 2 cases with fever or respiratory symptoms occurring within 2 weeks in small areas, such as home, office, school class, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever or respiratory symptoms; (2) characteristics in images of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell counts showing a number of normal, decreased or reduced lymphocytes in the early stage.
The diagnosis of a confirmed case should be based on a suspected case with some characteristic of pathogen or serological testing as follows: (1) positive real-time polymerase chain reaction test for SARS-COV-2; (2) complete viral genome sequencing showing high homogeneity to the recognized new coronaviruses; (3) positive outcome for specific IgM antibody and specific IgG antibody against SARS-COV-2 in a serum test; or a specific antibody change IgG against SARS-COV-2 from negative to positive, or increased titration ≥4 times more in the recovery phase than in the acute phase.
We can see that the real-time polymerase chain reaction test to detect nucleic acid in blood samples or airways was added to the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions.
The detection of blood sample pathogens was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; then, the serological tests were added to the seventh edition.
{NS}
In addition, there is more and more evidence that reminds us that we should be cautious with asymptomatic and symptomatic atypical patients.
Therefore, the flow diagram of Zhou et al. should be updated, since they classified the person without clinical symptoms as \"under risk\"
The scoring system should also be verified in other clinical studies and practices.
To conclude, we expect more direct evidence to arise and we ask readers to send us their comments.
For the diagnosis of - suspect case - and - confirmed case - we recommend looking for and complying with the latest guidelines in their countries of origin.
Our team will also update our guideline in a timely manner to provide help.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19, the largest in one day
Bangladesh yesterday confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19 in one day.
It's the largest number of deaths in a day due to the virus.
Until yesterday, the Institute for Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) of Bangladesh reported that the number of registered infected cases included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases remaining in their homes.
A total of 17 deaths have been reported.
At an online briefing, the director of the IEDCR, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said the victims were four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were over 60 years old, two between 51 and 60 years old and one between 41 and 50 years old.
He also said that two of the victims were from Dhaka.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local media outlet, that one of the deceased was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Commission, who was attending the Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, the Bangladesh Ministry of Road and Bridges, Obaidul Quader, said that public transport would be suspended for longer than originally planned, until next Saturday.
This suspension of public transport had begun on 26 March and was expected to end on Saturday, 4 April.
The transport of essential products, such as medical supplies, fuel and food, was still permitted.
The first recorded cases of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh occurred on 8 March, it was two men who returned from Italy and also the woman of one of them.
By March 19, these three had already recovered.
More than a million SARS-CoV-2 infections worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronary infections exceeded one million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
At least 52,000 deaths were related to COVID-19, the disease caused by coronavirus.
The hit took place the same day that Malaui confirmed his first coronary virus infections and Zambia had his first kronavirus-related death.
North Korea stated on Thursday that it was one of the few countries without coronavirus infections.
Yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1 051 635 confirmed cases, including 79 332 cases in the twenty-four hours prior to 10:00 a.m., European Central Time (UTC-0800), of 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus were reported, linked to at least 5900 deaths.
CBS News reported, citing Johns Hopkins University data, that on Wednesday there were more than 1000 deaths in the United States caused by coronavirus infections.
Throughout the world, countries announced stricter measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, Moscow's mayor, extended the closure of the city until May 1.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin stated that the Russians would continue to receive their wages without going to work until 30 April.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the state of national emergency 15 days; the vote was adopted by 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions and one against.
Saudi Arabia extended the curfews in the holy cities La Mecca and Medina throughout the day; previously, the curfew was only maintained between 3:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.
Thailand planned to implement a curfew between 10:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state had extended its order to stay home until May 1.
Supermarkets in Australia lower toilet paper limits by transaction
On Sunday and Saturday afternoon, the Woolworths and Coles Australian supermarket chains lowered their purchase limits of toilet paper to two and one package per transaction at all supermarkets in the country, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also applied the boundary of a package.
These limitations were published as messages in the boxes and on the Facebook pages of the chains.
Consumers were reportedly providing for fear of COVID-19 in case people had to self-insulate.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the purchase of toilet paper for home delivery to a package on request.
These changes were introduced after the previous restriction of four packages per transaction applied by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March, respectively.
Coles, in his press release of March 8, reported that, with the application of the restriction of four packages, -many supermarkets still exhaust the product within one hour of delivery - and said the demand - was unprecedented - while ALDI, in a Facebook release on Tuesday, said it was -unexpected -
The sales went up with a \"strong increase\" last week, according to a voicer from Woolworths.
The Costco supermarket in Canberra also limited the amount to two packages last week.
To further alleviate the scarcity, Coles requested larger packages from suppliers and increased the frequency of deliveries, Woolworths ordered additional stocks, while ALDI made stocks available for a special scheduled Wednesday offer in advance.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said that retailers are trying to increase stocks, but local town hall restrictions on truck delivery times make it difficult.
It provides for an increase in production costs, as suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer offers.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that, after the early release of stocks, some supermarkets cannot make the special offer of Wednesday.
In a report at News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retailer at the University of Technology in Queensland, said supermarkets supply stocks every night.
He pointed out that toilet paper is a bulky item, which causes a low number of stocks in numbers, and, when it is exhausted, leaves a wide empty space on shelves, which intensifies the feeling of scarcity.
Coles and Woolworths have the idea of [that] if there was an abundant amount of the article on the shelves, if products such as toilet paper rolls and disinfectants could [buy] and there were large amounts, the panic would probably be minimized, Russell Zimmerman said by ABC News.
The recycled toilet paper manufacturer Who Gives a Crap said last Wednesday they exhausted the stocks.
Kimberly-Clark, who manufactures the toilet paper Kleenex, and Solaris Paper, which manufactures Sorbent, noted that they were working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to maintain the supply, according to the report at News.com.au.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that some property vendors offered free toilet paper to the first auctioner in Melbourne, when less auctions were made because buyers had free time the long weekend of the Workers' Day.
The edition of the Thursday of NT News, a newspaper printed in Darwin, included an eight-page package designed to be cut and used as a toilet paper.
Supermarkets at first were reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a report by ABC Australia dated 3 March, in which they said they had no plans to place restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also have a lot of demand, including masks, disinfectant, dry products, liquid soap and flour.
Similarly, out of Australia, on Sunday afternoon it was observed that the online British supermarket Ocado limited the purchases of the toilet paper Andres to two packs of 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization declares the COPID-19 pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-COV-2 coronavirus.
Although the word ‘pandemia’ refers only to the extent of the spread of a disease, not to how dangerous the specific cases are, the WHO stressed the need to encourage Governments to take action:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries detect, test, treat, isolate, identify and mobilize their inhabitants in the response, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director General.
We are very concerned, both at alarming levels of propagation and gravity, and at alarming levels of inaction.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States, the pandemic - it is unprecedented -
In statements published by CNN in February, he stated, in addition to the influence, no other respiratory virus has been traced from appearance to continued global spread.
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar opinion, and said, \"Never before have we seen a pandemic caused by a coronavirus\"
\"And we've never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time before,\" he added.
The new pandemic condition arises following the WHO decision in January to declare the outbreak of an international public health emergency.
The director of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases of the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about the outbreak, - in conclusion, it will get worse -
Until Thursday, Associated Press reported that there were at least 126 000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, and more than 4600 deaths.
Coronavirus pandemic 2019-20 is an ongoing disease pandemic by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, as a public health emergency of international importance on 30 January 2020, and was recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As at 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 were reported in 210 countries and territories, and about 97 000 deaths as a result.
Around 364,000 people recovered.
It was estimated that the case-by-case fatality rate is 4 % in China, while globally, it ranges from 13.04 % in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to the occurrence of symptoms is usually about five days, but may range from two to fourteen days.
There is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment.
The primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. The recommended preventive measures include hand washing, mouth covering when coughing, maintaining distance from other people, and controlling and self-insulation of people who suspect that they are infected.
Authorities around the world responded by implementing travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace hazard controls and closures.
The pandemic caused a serious global socio-economic disorder, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and the widespread shortage of supplies aggravated by panic-driven purchases.
Schools and universities closed at the national or local level in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of the world's student population.
Misinformation on the Internet virus was disseminated, and there were incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, other people of Eastern and South-East Asian descent and appearance, and other areas with significant virus cases.
Owing to reduced travel and closures of the heavy industry, a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions occurred.
On 31 December 2019, health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of the province of Hubei) reported a group of cases of unknown cause pneumonia, and an investigation was initiated in early January 2020.
The cases, in most cases, were related to the wholesale market for shellfish in Huan, so the virus was thought to have a zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-COV-2, a newly discovered virus closely related to the coronaviruses of bats, the coronaviruses of the pangolines and SARS-COV. Subsequently, it was found that the first person who was known to have manifested symptoms was ill on December 1, 2019, and that person had no visible connections with the last group of wet market.
Of the first group of cases reported in December 2019, it was determined that two thirds had a link with the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified South China Morning Post report suggested that, a case dated 17 November 2019, of a 55-year-old person from Hubei province, could have been the first. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that, as the new cases reported, they decreased in China but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had for the first time exceeded the number of new cases within China.
There may be a considerable number of uninformed cases, especially among those with milder symptoms.
As at 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported in young persons, and those aged 19 and under accounted for 2.4 per cent of cases worldwide. Patrick Vallance, the UK’s leading scientific adviser, estimated that 60% of the British population would have to be infected before effective collective immunity could be achieved.
The cases relate to the number of persons who underwent evidence of COVID-19 and who obtained a positive result confirmed by the official protocols.
As at 23 March, no country had conducted tests in more than 3% of its population, and many countries have had official policies not to perform tests in persons with only mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March revealed that, in China, up to 23 January, an estimated 86 % of CVID-19 infections had not been detected, and that these unregistered infections were the source of infection of 79 % of registered cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the amounts of infections in Italy were considerably higher than reported cases.
The initial estimates of the basic reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention determined that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 are recovered.
For those who do not, the time from the development of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, being the most common 14 days.
As at 10 April 2020, approximately 97 000 deaths had been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, on 5 February, about 80% of deaths corresponded to people over 60 years of age, and 75% had pre-existing diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Official death records by the CVID-19 pandemic usually refer to the deceased who gave positive evidence of CVID, according to the official protocols.
The number of actual deaths due to COVID-19 may be much higher, as people who died may not be included without proof, for example, in their homes, in elderly homes, etc.
Italy's partial data revealed that the number of additional deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID death registration in a factor of 4 to 5 times.
A spokesperson for the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted - We know that [the number of deaths declared] is a underestimation - a statement corroborated by the anecdotal sub-content reports in the United States. This underestimation is common in the pandemics, as in the 2009 H1N1 swine influenza pandemic. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on 14 February.
On 28 February, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths occurred in each of the countries of Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As at 13 March, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths, on all continents except Antarctica. Generally, several indicators are used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary depending on the region and over time, and are influenced by the number of tests, the quality of the health system, treatment options, the time elapsed from the initial outbreak and the characteristics of the population, such as age, sex and general health. The proportion of deaths in cases reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a given period of time.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global proportion of deaths in cases is 6.0% (97 039/1 617 204) as at 10 April 2020.
The number varies according to the region.
In China, estimates of the proportion of deaths in cases decreased from 17.3% (in those with symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (in those with symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other indicators include the case-by-case mortality rate, which reflects the percentage of diagnosed individuals who died from a disease, and the rate of mortality from infections, which reflects the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who died because of a disease.
These statistics do not have a specific deadline and consider a specific population from infection to resolution of the case.
Some academics have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Oxford University Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates that the rate of mortality due to pandemic infections as a whole is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The higher estimate of this range is consistent with the results of the first random tests for VOC-19 in Germany, and a statistical study that analyzed the impact of the tests on the estimates of the lethality rate by case.
WHO states that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and final duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may differ according to the location.
Maciej Boni from Pennsylvania State University indicated, -Infectious outbreaks, if they are not controlled, generally stabilize and then begin to decrease when the disease is without guests available.
But, right now, it's almost impossible to make any reasonable forecast when that happens.
The main medical adviser to the Government of China, Zhong Nanshan, argued that, in June, it could be done if all countries could be mobilized to follow the WHO recommendation on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, stated that SARS-COV-2 - will possibly circulate for one or two years -
According to the Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be necessary - until a vaccine is available (possibly 18 months or more) -
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, \"I think this coronavirus is unlikely, given that it is transmitted so easily, it disappears completely,\" and - it could become a seasonal disease, which reappears every year -
The virulence of the reappearance would depend on collective immunity and the magnitude of the mutation.
Symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively non-specific and infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less frequent symptoms include fatigue, production of foam in the airways (flame), loss of sense of smell, lack of air, muscle and joint pain, throat pain, headache, chills, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhoea or cyanosis. WHO states that approximately one in six people is seriously ill and has difficulty breathing.
According to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), emergency symptoms include difficulty in breathing, pressure or persistent pain in the chest, sudden confusion, difficulty in waking up and blue color in the face or lips; in the event of these symptoms, immediate medical care is recommended. The greatest advance of the disease may result in severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, do not have clinical symptoms, although the test results confirm infection, therefore, researchers advised to monitor and examine closely those who have close contact with confirmed infected persons in order to rule out infection.
The Chinese estimates of the proportion of asymptomatic people range from a few to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between infection and the onset of symptoms) ranged from one to 14 days; most often it is 5 days. As an example of uncertainty, the estimation of the proportion of people with CVID-19 who lost their sense of smell at first was 30% and then decreased to 15%.
Some details of how the disease spreads are still being determined.
It is believed that the disease is spread mainly during close contact and through small drops that occur when coughing, sneezing or talking; close contact is considered a distance of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
According to the studies, when coughing is not covered the mouth the droplets can move from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some have proposed that the virus can also be transmitted through small drops that remain in the air for longer periods, which can be generated when speaking. Also respiratory droplets may occur during exhalation, even when talking, although, generally, the virus is not transmitted by air.
The droplets may enter the mouth or nose of people who are near or possibly inhaled to the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as cardiopulmonary intubation and resuscitation (CPR), can cause aerosolization of respiratory secretions and thus air propagation.
It can also spread when one touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches the eyes, nose or mouth.
While there is concern that it can be transmitted through faeces, this risk is believed to be low.
The Chinese Government denied the possibility of oral faecal transmission of SARS-COV-2. The virus is more contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although the spread may be possible before symptoms are manifest and in more advanced stages of the disease.
People achieved positive results in disease tests up to three days before symptoms occurred, indicating that transmission is possible before developing significant symptoms.
There are only a few reports of laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic cases, but some countries have identified asymptomatic transmission during contact tracking investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) argues that although it is not fully clear how easy the disease is to spread, usually one person infects two or three others. The virus survives from hours to days on the surfaces.
Specifically, it was determined that the virus is detectable for up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel 304, one day in cardboard and up to four hours in copper.
This, however, varies according to humidity and temperature. Positive results were obtained in tests of COVID-19 performed on pets and other animals.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although the British authorities recommend washing their hands after contact with animals, as well as after contact with other surfaces that may have touched infected people.
Coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia linked to the group of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
All features of the new SARS-COV-2 virus are found in the coronaviruses related to nature. Outside the human body, the virus dies when it comes into contact with soap, which dissolves its protective wrapper. SARS-COV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-COV.
It is believed to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus is genetically grouped with the genus betacoronavirus, its subgener sarbecovirus (line B) along with two strains derived from the bat.
At the full genome level, it is 96 % identical to other mucielago coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one difference in amino acids in certain parts of genome sequences between pangoline viruses and those of human beings.
To date, the comparison of the complete genome indicated that the coronavirus of pangolines and SARS-COV-2 share a maximum of 92% of the genetic material, which is not sufficient to show that pangolines are the intermediate host.
Virus infection can be provisionally diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, although, ultimately, it is confirmed by the chain reaction of polymerase with reverse transcriptase (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or by computed tomography.
According to a study conducted in Wuhan in which the polymerase chain reaction was compared with computed tomography, computed tomography is much more sensitive than the polymerase chain reaction, although less specific, and many of the characteristics in the images coincide with the processes of other diseases and pneumonia.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends - not using computed tomography as a detection method or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19 -
WHO has published several RNA test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on 17 January.
The test uses the polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcriptase in real time (rRT-PCR).
The test can be done in blood or respiratory samples.
Results are generally available within a few hours or days.
Usually, this test is performed with a nasopharyngeal hysop, although a hyssop can also be used for the throat. Some laboratories and companies are developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
As at 6 April 2020, none of these proved to be accurate enough to approve its widespread use.
In the US, a serological test developed by Cellex was approved for emergency use by certified laboratories only.
Characteristic features in computed x-ray and tomography images (CTs) of symptomatic individuals include opacities in asymmetric peripheral exposed glass and missing pleural effusions.
The Italian Society of Radiology is compiling an international online database of the results obtained in confirmed case images.
Due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, the unconfirmed imaging diagnosis by polymerase chain reaction has a limited specificity in the identification of COVID-19.
A comprehensive study conducted in China compared the results of computed chest tomography with those of polymerase chain reaction and showed that, although imaging diagnosis is less specific for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its consideration as a detection tool in areas affected by the epidemic.
Convolutional neural networks based on artificial intelligence were developed to detect virus characteristics in images, both with X-rays and computed tomography.
Strategies to prevent transmission of the disease include maintaining good general personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with hands without having washed them before, and sneezing or coughing on a disposable cloth and throwing the cloth directly into a waste container.
It is recommended that those who may already be infected use a surgical mask in public.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission. Many Governments have restricted or discouraged all non-essential travel from and to countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached the stage of community spread in many parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some community members don't know where or how they got infected. It is recommended that health care providers who might be infected take standard precautions, contact precautions and use eye protection. The tracking of contacts is an important method for health authorities to determine the origin of an infection and to prevent further transmission.
The use of mobile phone location data by governments for this purpose has generated concerns about privacy, and Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement demanding limits on this type of surveillance.
A number of mobile applications have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working in privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record a user's proximity to other mobile phones.
The users then receive a message if they were in close contact with someone who gave positive in the COVID-19 test. They are circulating misconceptions about how to prevent infection; for example, nasal lavage and mouthwash gargargas are not effective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19, although many organizations are working to develop one.
Handwashing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands often with water and soap for at least twenty seconds, especially after using the bathroom or when they have their hands visibly dirty; before eating and after the nose, coughing or sneezing.
This is because, outside the human body, the virus dies when it comes into contact with soap, which disintegrates its protective bubble.
The CDC also recommended using an alcohol-based hand disinfectant with at least 60% alcohol in volume when water and soap are not available.
WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with their hands without having washed them before.
The surfaces can be decontaminated with several solutions (within one minute after exposure to disinfectant on a stainless steel surface), including ethanol at 62-71%, isopropanol at 50-00 %, sodium hypochlorite at 0.1 %, hydrogen peroxide at 0.5 % and povidone at 0.2-7.5 %.
Other solutions, such as benzoalconium chloride and chlorohexidine gluconate, are less effective.
CDCs recommend that, if a case of COVID is suspected or confirmed in an installation, such as an office or nursery, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common spaces, shared electronic equipment, such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls and ATMs that have been used by sick people are disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with flexed elbow or with a disposable cloth for coughing or sneezing, and that they immediately discard the handkerchief.
It is recommended that those who might be infected use surgical masks, since the use of a mask can limit the volume and distance travelled by the respiratory droplets that are dispersed when talking, sneezing and coughing.
WHO issued instructions on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at Leeds University, using a mask can reduce the tendency of people to touch their faces, which is an important source of infection without proper hand hygiene - the use of masks has also been recommended in people who care for someone who might have the disease.
WHO has recommended the use of masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, for example, those who care for a person with COVID-19, although it also recognizes that using masks can help people avoid touching their faces.
Several countries have begun to encourage the use of masks by the public.
In the US, CDCs recommend using non-medical masks made of cloth. China specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks by healthy members of the public, especially when they are in close contact (1 metre (3 feet) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends using a surgical mask to take public transportation or to be in crowded locations.
Thailand’s health officials recommend that people make cloth masks in their homes and wash them on a daily basis.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia prohibited going out into public spaces without using a mask or covering the nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam requested that all people use a mask by being in public spaces in order to protect themselves and protect others.
The Government of Austria demanded the use of masks by all persons entering a supermarket.
Israel requested that all residents use masks in public.
Taiwan, which has manufactured ten million masks a day since mid-March, on 1 April, demanded the use of masks by passengers on interurban trains and buses.
Panama imposed the mandatory use of masks for outdoors, while it also recommended the manufacture of homemade masks for those who cannot buy them.
Masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes measures for control of infection designed to curb the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between people.
The methods include quarantines, travel restrictions and closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres and shopping centres.
People can implement social distancing methods by staying in their homes, limiting travel, avoiding the areas covered, using forms of health that do not include contact and physically distance from other people.
Many Governments now demand or recommend social distancing in outbreak-affected regions.
The maximum size of meetings recommended by government agencies and U.S. health organizations was reduced rapidly by 250 people (if there was no known spread of COVID-19 in a region) to 50 people, and subsequently to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public meetings of more than two people. Older adults and those with underlying diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension and compromised immune systems are at greater risk of suffering serious diseases and complications, and the CDCs recommend that they remain in their homes as much as possible in the areas of the community affected by the outbreak. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health agencies began to replace the use of the term \"social disengagement\" by \"physical disengagement\" to clarify that the goal is to reduce physical contact while maintaining social connections, either virtually or remotely.
The use of the term “social disengagement” has had as its impact the assumption that people should adopt a complete social isolation, rather than encouraging them to stay in touch with other people through alternative means. Some authorities have published guidelines on sexual health to use during the pandemic.
They include recommendations to only have sexual intercourse with a person with whom you live, who does not have the virus or symptoms of the virus.
Self-insulation at home was recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected of being infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions on adequate self-insulation, and many Governments have required or recommended the self-reliance of entire populations in the affected areas.
The stricter self quarantine instructions were issued for those belonging to high-risk groups.
People who may have been in contact with COVID-19 and who have recently traveled to a country or region with widespread transmission are recommended to make self-care for 14 days from the time of the last possible exposure.
Strategies for controlling an outbreak are containment or suppression and mitigation.
The containment is carried out in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to identify and isolate infected persons, in addition to introducing other measures to control the infection and vaccines to prevent the disease from spreading to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to control the spread of the disease, efforts are moved to the mitigation phase: measures are taken to curb the spread and mitigate its effects on the health system and society.
A combination of containment and mitigation measures can be adopted at the same time.
Suppression requires more extreme measures in order to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic number of reproduction to less than 1. Part of controlling the outbreak of an infectious disease involves trying to decrease the epidemic peak, which is known as flattening the curve of the epidemic.
This decreases the risk of collapsing health services and allows more time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can control the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, the use of masks and self-care; community measures aimed at physical distancing, such as closure of schools and cancellation of mass competition events; community commitment to promote acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures and surface cleaning. In China, more drastic measures were taken to contain the outbreak once its severity was evident, for example, the implementation of quarantines in whole cities and the imposition of strict travel bans.
Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea implemented mass detection and quarantine assessments located, and issued alerts on the movements of infected persons.
Singapore provided financial support to the infected people who decided to quarantine and imposed large fines on those who did not.
Taiwan increased the production of masks and sanctioned the accumulation of medical supplies. The simulations in Britain and the United States show that mitigation (which decreases the spread of the epidemic but does not stop it) and suppression (reverses the growth of the pandemic) have great challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies could reduce the maximum demand for medical care in two-thirds and deaths by half, but still generate hundreds of thousands of deaths and the collapse of health systems.
Suppression may be preferred, but it should be maintained for the whole time that the virus circulates in the human population (or until there is a vaccine available, if that happens first), since, otherwise, the transmission is quickly reactive when the measures are flexible.
Long-term intervention to eliminate the pandemic implies social and economic costs.
There are no specific antiviral drugs approved for COVID-19, but efforts are being made to develop them, including testing existing medicines.
Taking free sales medicines for cold, drinking liquids, and rest can help relieve symptoms.
According to gravity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids and respiratory assistance may be needed.
Using steroids can make the results worse.
Several compounds that were previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being investigated for use in the treatment of CVID-19.
WHO also indicated that some (home and traditional remedies) can alleviate the symptoms caused by SARS-COV-19.
WHO describes the increased capacity and adaptation of medical care to the needs of patients with COVID-19 as a fundamental measure of response to the outbreak.
ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have developed guidelines for primary health care hospitals and services for redistributing resources at different levels, including focusing laboratory services on VOC-19 testing, cancel optional procedures where possible, separate and isolate positive patients in VOC-19, and increase intensive care capacity through staff training and increased number of available breathers and beds.
There are several theories as to where the first case may have originated (the so-called zero patient).
The first case known for the new coronavirus can be traced back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Over the course of a month, the number of cases of coronaviruses in Hubei gradually increased.
These were mainly linked to the wholesale market for shellfish in Huanan, which also sold live animals, and one theory is that the virus came from one of these animals; or, in other words, it has a zoonotic origin. On 26 December, a number of cases of pneumonia unknown to those taken over by Dr. Zhang Jixian at Hubei Provincial Hospital, who informed the Jianghan CDC in Wuhan on 27 December.
On 30 December, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a SARS-like \"coronavirus\"
The police warned eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, for spreading false rumors, and another doctor, Ai Fen, was rebuked by his superiors for giving the alarm.
Subsequently, on 31 December, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public note and informed WHO.
In early January, sufficient cases of unknown cause pneumonia had been reported to the health authorities in Wuhan to initiate an investigation. During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, contributing to migration through the Chinese New Year and the fact that Wuhan is a transportation centre and an important railway crossing.
On 20 January, China reported about 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Later official data show that as of 20 January 2020, 6174 people had already developed symptoms. On 26 March, the United States overcame China and Italy with the largest number of cases confirmed in the world. As of 9 April 2020, more than 1,61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97 000 people have died and more than 364 000 have recovered.
Around 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
Because of the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted free movement and established border controls.
National reactions have included containment measures, such as quarantines (known as orders to stay at home, shelter orders at the place or confinement) and curfews. On 2 April, about 300 million people, or approximately 90 per cent of the population, meet some kind of confinement in the United States, more than 50 million people are confined in the Philippines, some 59 million people are confined in South Africa and 13 billion people are confined in India.
As at 26 March, 17 billion people worldwide had some kind of confinement, which increased to 26 billion people two days later, about one third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 dates back to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report indicates that the first case occurred on 17 November.
On 26 December, Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a group of cases of unknown cause pneumonia, and her hospital informed the Jianghan CDC in Wuhan on 27 December.
The first genetic tests of patient samples on 27 December 2019 indicated the presence of a coronavirus similar to SARS.
On 31 December, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public note.
WHO was informed on the same day.
While these notifications were being made, the police warned the doctors in Wuhan about — spreading rumors — about the outbreak.
The Chinese National Health Commission at first stated that there was no clear evidence of human transmission.
At the end of January, the Chinese Government launched a drastic campaign, later described by Chinese Communist Party Secretary General Xi Jinping, as a \"popular war\" to contain the spread of the virus.
In what was described as - the largest quarantine in the history of humanity - on 23 January a health cord was announced to ban travel within and outside Wuhan, this spread to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, and affected a total of 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles in the city was prohibited.
The celebrations of the Chinese New Year (25 January) were cancelled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, the Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Later, another hospital, the Leishenshan Hospital, was built to receive more patients.
In addition to the new hospitals built, China also became 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as convention and stadium centres, in temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the Government implemented further measures to contain the outbreak of the COVID-19, which included the issuance of health statements for travellers and the extension of the Spring Day holiday.
Universities and schools throughout the country were also closed.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions implemented several measures, especially in relation to schools and universities.
Remote work measures were established in several regions of China.
Travel restrictions were implemented inside and outside Hubei.
Public transportation was modified and museums were temporarily closed throughout China.
Control of the public movement was implemented in several cities, and it has been estimated that about 760 million people (over half the population) faced some kind of restriction on outdoor exits. After the start of the global outbreak phase in March, the Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the -import - of the virus from other countries.
For example, Beijing has imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine for all international travellers entering the city. On 23 March, only one case had been transmitted at the national level in the previous five days, on this occasion, through a traveler who returned from Istanbul to Canton.
On 24 March 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that the spread of cases transmitted at the national level was basically blocked and that the outbreak had been controlled in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions in Hubei, as well as in Wuhan, were relaxed two months after the confinement was imposed. On 26 March 2020, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China announced that the entry of visa holders or residence permits would be suspended as of 28 March, without specific details of when this policy would end.
Those wishing to enter China must apply for visas in Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Government of China encouraged companies and factories to reopen on 30 March and provided economic stimulus packages for signatures. The Council of State declared a day of mourning that it will start with a three-minute national silence on 4 April at 10:00, coinciding with the Qingming Festival, although the central government asked the families to show their respect online to comply with the physical distance in order to avoid the outbreak of the COVID-19.
On 20 January 2020, it was confirmed that COVID-19 spread from China to South Korea.
On 20 February, the health agency of the country reported a significant increase in confirmed cases, primarily attributed to a meeting in Daegu of a new religious movement known as the Church of Jesus Shincheonji.
It is suspected that Shincheonji devotees who visited Daegu from Wuhan were the origin of the outbreak.
On 22 February, out of the 9336 church followers, 1261 or approximately 13% reported symptoms. On 23 February 2020, South Korea declared the maximum warning level.
On 28 February, more than 2000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, which increased to 3150 on 29 February.
All military bases in South Korea remained quarantined after the evidence confirmed that three soldiers were positive for the virus.
Airlines schedules were also affected, and therefore changed. South Korea presented what was considered to be the largest and best organized programme in the world to test the virus in the population and isolate infected persons, as well as to identify and quarantine those who were in contact with them.
The detection methods included mandatory self-reporting of symptoms by newly arrived people from other countries through a mobile application, drive-thru centers to perform virus detection tests with results available the following day and increased diagnostic capacity to test up to 20,000 people every day.
The South Korean programme is considered a success in controlling the outbreak despite not adopting quarantine in entire cities. South Korea's society at first was polarized with regard to President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions to demand the removal of Moon, which they considered to be a mismanagement of the outbreak by the Government, or to praise its response.
On 23 March, it was reported that South Korea had the total number of cases in one day lower in four weeks.
On 29 March, it was reported that, from 1 April, all newly arrived persons from abroad should remain in quarantine for two weeks.
According to media reports, on 1 April, South Korea received applications for virus testing assistance from 121 different countries.
On 19 February, Iran reported its first confirmed cases of SARS-COV-2 infections in Qom, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died later that same day.
Early measures announced by the Government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural events, sporting events and Friday prayers, and the closure of universities, higher education institutions and schools.
Iran has destined five trillions of rinals to fight the virus.
On 26 February 2020, President Hassan Rouhani said that there were no plans to quarantine the areas affected by the outbreak, and that only people would be quarantined.
In March, plans were announced to limit travel between cities, although heavy traffic among cities as a result of the year New Persian Nowruz continued.
The Chinese shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until 16 March 2020. During February, Iran became a center for the spread of the virus after China.
In the midst of a cover-up of the magnitude of the outbreak in Iran, more than ten countries had traced their cases to Iran by 28 February, indicating that the magnitude of the outbreak could be more serious than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian Government by that date.
The Iranian Parliament closed, and on 3 March 23 of its 290 members reported positive results in the virus test.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch urged Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent, and to temporarily release all eligible prisoners.
He indicated that there is a greater risk of virus spread in closed institutions, such as detention centres, which also lack adequate medical care.
On 15 March, the Iranian Government reported 100 deaths on the same day, the largest recorded number in the country since the beginning of the outbreak.
As at 17 March, at least 12 Iranian expolytics or politicians had died from the disease.
As of March 23, Iran experienced 50 new cases per hour and one new death every ten minutes due to the coronavirus.
According to one WHO official, there may be five times more reported cases in Iran.
It is also suggested that U.S. sanctions on Iran might be affecting the country's financial capacity to respond to the viral outbreak.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has demanded relief from economic sanctions for the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On 31 January, the spread of the outbreak to Italy was confirmed, when two Chinese tourists gave positive evidence of SARS-COV-2 in Rome.
Cases began to increase rapidly, leading the Italian Government to suspend all flights from and to China and declare the state of emergency.
Subsequently, a group of unrelated COVID-19 cases was detected, which began with 16 cases confirmed in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced a new decree law to contain the outbreak, which included quarantine of more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
The prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, said, \"It will not be allowed to enter or leave the areas affected by the outbreak.
The suspension of labour and sporting events in these areas has already been ordered. On 4 March, the Italian Government ordered the complete closure of schools and universities throughout the country while Italy reached 100 deaths.
All major sporting events, including the Series A football matches, were to be held at closed doors until April, but, on March 9, all sporting events were fully suspended for at least one month.
On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte ordered the interruption of virtually all commercial activities except supermarkets and pharmacies. On 6 March, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) issued medical ethics recommendations on the screening protocols that could be used.
On March 19, Italy overcame China as the country with the largest number of kronavirus-related deaths in the world after reporting 3405 pandemic deaths.
On 22 March, it was reported that Russia had sent nine military aircraft with medical equipment to Italy.
As at 5 April, there were 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 recoveries in Italy, and most of these cases occurred in the Lombardy region.
A CNN report indicated that the combination of Italy with a large elderly population and the inability to test all people who have the virus to date could contribute to the high lethality rate.
The United Kingdom's response to the virus first arose as one of the most relaxed affected countries, and until 18 March 2020, the British Government did not impose any type of social distancing or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the Government received criticism of the apparent lack of speed and intensity in its response to concerns faced by the public. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made an announcement in which he discouraged social contact and all non-essential travels, and suggested that people work from their homes whenever possible and avoid places such as bars, restaurants and theaters.
On 20 March, the Government announced the closure of all leisure establishments, such as bars and gymnasiums, as soon as possible, and promised to pay up to 80% of workers' wages to a limit of 2500 GBP per month to prevent unemployment during the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced stricter social distancing measures, which prohibited meetings of more than two people and restricted travel and outdoor activities to those who were considered strictly necessary.
Unlike the above measures, the police could require compliance with these restrictions through fines and the dispersion of meetings.
The closure of most companies was ordered, with the exception of those considered essential, including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, gas stations and workshops.

Despite doing so, the United States had a slow beginning in conducting tests, which concealed the true magnitude of the outbreak at that time.
The conduct of tests was thwarted by the faulty test kits produced by the Federal Government in February, the lack of approval by the Federal Government of the non-governmental test kits (of academies, companies and hospitals) until the end of February and the restrictive criteria for persons to qualify for a test by the beginning of March (after a medical order was required).

WHO noted the difference between the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak, when the Chinese secretism authorities were accused of preventing prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis, in which the central government has provided periodic updates to avoid panic at New Lunar Year holidays.
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to implement a transport ban in Wuhan, the representative of WHO Gauden Galea noted that, while, while it was definitely not a recommendation made by WHO, it was - a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic in the place where it is most concentrated - and said that - it had no precedent in the history of public health - on 30 January, following the confirmation of the transmission of human beings outside China and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO declared the outbreak of an international public health emergency (SPII), the sixth SPII since the first time invoking the measure during the 2009 swine flu pandemic.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said that SPII was due - at the risk of global spread, especially to low- and medium-income countries without sound health systems -
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that there are no grounds for taking measures that needlessly interfere with international trade and travel, and that the \"WHO does not recommend limiting trade or movement\"
On 5 February, WHO appealed to the world community for a $675 million contribution to finance a strategic preparation in low-income countries, and cited the urgency of supporting those countries - which do not have systems to detect people who contracted the virus, if any -
Tedros also made statements in which he stated that - we are just as strong as our weakest link - and urged the international community to - invest today or pay more in the future - On 11 February, WHO announced at a press conference that COVID-19 was the name of the disease.
On the same day, Tedros stated that the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, had agreed to contribute the “power of the entire United Nations system in the response”
As a result, a United Nations crisis management team was activated, enabling coordination of the response of all the United Nations, which, according to WHO, will enable them to focus on health response while other agencies can provide their expertise to address the social, economic and wider development implications of the outbreak.
On 14 February, a joint mission team led by WHO with China was activated to provide international and WHO field experts in China to assist in national management and to assess - the severity and transmissibility of the disease - through the organization of workshops and meetings with major institutions at the national level and to make visits to the site to assess - the impact of response activities at the provincial and county levels, including urban and rural environments - on 25 February, WHO stated that - the world must do more to prepare for a possible kronavirus pandemic - and noted that, although it was still very early to call it a pandemic, countries should still be - in a stage of preparation -
In response to a development outbreak in Iran, WHO sent a joint mission team to assess the situation there. On 28 February, WHO officials said that the global assessment of the kronavirus threat would rise from -high to -higher - its highest level of alertness and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergency Programme, warned in a statement that: This is a reality check for all governments on the planet: wake up.
This virus may be on its way and we must be prepared - insisting that adequate response measures could help the world avoid - the worst -
Ryan also said that the current data did not guarantee that public health officials would declare a worldwide pandemic, and said that such a statement would mean that - we are basically accepting that all human beings on the planet will be exposed to that virus -
On 11 March, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak pandemic.
The Director-General said that the WHO was - much concerned, both with alarming levels of propagation and severity, and with alarming levels of inaction - WHO has received important criticisms that are considered inappropriate management of the pandemic, including the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.

The experts emphasized that all persons have the right to health, including persons with disabilities, those belonging to minority groups, older persons, internally displaced persons, homeless persons, those living in conditions of extreme poverty, persons with disabilities, refugees and other unspecified groups in need of government support.
International government organizations are addressing the social and economic impacts of the crisis by COVID-19.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development launched a platform to provide comprehensive and timely information on political responses in countries around the world, as well as views and advice.
From policies to strengthen health systems and the world economy to addressing the effects of containment and travel restrictions, the digital centre includes a country policy tracker, and aims to help countries learn from each other and facilitate a coordinated global response to the challenge of coronavirus.
The Government of China has been criticized by the United States, the Minister of the Office of the Cabinet of the United Kingdom, Michael Gove, and the son of the president of Brazil Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro, for his management of the pandemic, which began in the Chinese province of Hubei.
Several administrators were dismissed at the provincial level of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) because of their management of quarantine efforts in central China, a sign of discontent with the political system's response to outbreak in those regions.
Some commentators believe that this measure was taken to protect the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, from public anger by the outbreak of coronavirus.
Some Chinese officials, for example, Zhao Lijian, have rejected a previous recognition of the onset of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, in favor of conspiracy theories about the origin of COVID-19 in the US or Italy.
The administration of Donald Trump of the U.S. has referred to the coronavirus as the \"Chinese virus\" or the \"Wuhan virus\" and stated that China's \"censorship overpowered a virus that has now become a worldwide pandemic,\" which, in turn, has been pointed out by some critics as racism and \"distraction\" of the failure of its administration to contain the disease.
The Daily Beast obtained a telegram from the U.S. Government describing a stratagem of communications with apparent origins in the National Security Council, and cited the strategy as \"Everything about China\"
We have been told that we are trying to convey this message in any way possible, including press conferences and television appearances.-Media communication such as Politics, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have stated that China's efforts to send help to countries affected by the virus are part of a propaganda to gain global influence.
EU foreign policy representative Josep Borrell warned that - there is a geopolitical component that includes a struggle for influence through propaganda and generosity policy -
Borrell also said that \"China is aggressively pushing the message that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner\"
China also called for the United States to lift its sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while, according to reports, it sent assistance to the latter two countries.
On 3 April, United States sanctions blocked Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba.
The U.S. authorities were also accused of diverting aid from other countries to their own country.
There have been complaints of mascarilla-related disputes between other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, and between the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey seized hundreds of respirators destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian Government criticized the lack of solidarity between the European Union and Italy, affected by the coronavirus.
Maurizio Massari, Italian Ambassador to the European Union, said that only China responded bilaterally.
This is certainly not a good sign of European solidarity.
On 22 March, after a telephone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin arranged that the Russian army send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quoted an anonymous \"high-level policy source\" stating that 80% of Russia's aid was \"useless or of little use for Italy\"
The source accused Russia of undertaking a seduction offensive -geopolitics and diplomatic -
The President of Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio, rejected the journalistic reports and expressed their appreciation.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical help to the United States.
Kremlin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said that when offering help to U.S. colleagues, [Putin] assumes that, when U.S. manufacturers of medical equipment and equipment take the lead, they will also be able to respond if necessary.
NATO's planned military exercise -Defender 2020 - in Germany, Poland and the Baltic, NATO's largest war exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be carried out on a small scale.
The Secretary-General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Kate Hudson, criticized the Defense 2020 exercise: \"In the current public health crisis, it endangers the lives not only of the United States troops and the various European countries involved, but also of the people of the countries in which they operate - the Iranian Government was greatly affected by the virus, with about two dozen members of Parliament infected, as well as fifteen other current and previous political figures.
On 14 March 2020, Iran's President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders asking for help, and said that his country is having difficulty fighting the outbreak due to the lack of access to international markets as a result of United States sanctions against Iran. The outbreak prompted the demand that the United States adopt common social policies in other rich countries, such as universal medical care, universal child care, paid family leave and higher levels of public health funds.
Political analysts anticipated that it could negatively affect Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea worsened due to the pandemic.
South Korea criticized the “ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts” of Japan, after Japan announced that any person from South Korea will be quarantined for two weeks at government designated sites.
South Korea's society at first was polarized with respect to Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed requests to demand the removal of Moon, which they considered to be a mismanagement of the outbreak by the Government, or to praise its response. The pandemic has allowed countries to approve emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators have expressed concern that it could allow Governments to strengthen their control of power.
In Hungary, his Parliament voted to allow the Prime Minister, Viktor Orbán, to rule by decree indefinitely, to suspend Parliament and elections and punish those who are deemed to have spread false information about the virus and the management of the crisis by the Government.
It blamed the outbreak of a number of cases of supply shortages, as a result of the increased global use of equipment to combat outbreaks, panic-driven purchases and interruptions of logistics and factory operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about the shortage of medicines and medical equipment due to the increased demand for consumers and the disruption of suppliers.
Several localities also witnessed panic-driven purchases that left empty shelves of essential products, such as food, toilet paper and bottled water, which caused the shortage of supplies.
The technological sector, in particular, has been warning about delays in electronic product shipments.
According to WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom, demand for personal protection equipment increased 100 times.
This demand generated an increase in prices of up to twenty times the normal price and also caused delays from four to six months in the supply of medical goods.
It also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide, and WHO warned that this would put health workers at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for buyers to sell Australian products in China.
The activity has created a shortage of formula for babies in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian Government. Despite the high prevalence of cases of COVID-19 in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the subsequent demand for food, none of these areas were affected by the acute food shortage.
China and Italy's measures against the illicit accumulation and trade of essential products have been successful, and have avoided an acute shortage of food anticipated in Europe and North America.
Northern Italy, with its important agricultural production, has not had a significant reduction, but prices could increase, according to representatives of the sector.
Food shelves were only temporarily empty, even in the city of Wuhan, while Chinese government officials released the reserves of pork to ensure sufficient food for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy that require food producers to maintain reservations for these emergencies.
The damage to the world economy was felt in China: according to a journalistic report of 16 March, China's economy was greatly affected in the first two months of 2020 due to the measures taken by the Government to stop the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5%.
Since continental China is an important economic and manufacturing centre, the viral outbreak has been considered a significant threat of destabilization for the world economy.
Agathe Demarais of The Economist's Intelligence Unit has predicted that markets will remain volatile until a clearer picture of potential consequences emerges.
In January 2020, some analysts felt that the economic consequences of the global growth epidemic could outweigh those of the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak.
An estimate by an expert at the University of Washington in San Luis indicated an impact of more than $300 billion on the world's supply chains that could last up to two years.
It is reported that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) was “returned” after a sharp drop in oil prices due to China’s lower demand.
On 24 February, global securities markets fell due to a significant increase in the number of cases of COVID-19 outside mainland China.
On 27 February, due to growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, several U.S. bursatile indexes, including NASDAQ-100, the S&P 500 index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average published their most pronounced drop since 2008, the Dow dropped 1191 points, the biggest drop in one day since the financial crisis in 2007-08.
The three indexes ended the week with more than 10% casualties.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH affirmed China's sovereign credit rating, but held a negative perspective.
The actions fell again on the basis of the fears of the coronavirus, the biggest fall occurred on March 16.
Many consider that there is likely to be an economic recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures of states and central banks.
Central banks are reacting faster than they reacted to the 2008 financial collapse.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to travel bans, closure of public places that include travel attractions and the recommendation of Governments not to travel anywhere in the world.
As a result, numerous airlines have cancelled flights due to the lower demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, while the British regional airline Flybe collapsed.
The impact on the cruise business sector has reached a level never seen before.
Several railway stations and ferry terminals have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chunyun, a major travel season related to New Chinese New Year holidays.
Several events involving large crowds were cancelled by national and regional governments, including New Year's festivals, while private companies also independently closed their shops and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many events and tourist attractions of the New Lunar Year have been closed to avoid massive concentrations, including the Forbidden City of Beijing and the traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities and regions of China, the authorities extended the New Year's holiday until 10 February, and ordered most of the workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions account for 80% of GDP and 90% of the country's exports.
Hong Kong raised its level of response to infectious disease to the highest and declared an emergency, closed schools until March and cancelled its New Year celebrations. The retail sector was affected globally, with reductions in attention times or temporary closures.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East experienced a fall of 50 to 60 per cent.
This also resulted in a fall from 33% to 43% in pedestrian transit to commercial centres in March compared to February.
Operators from shopping centres around the world imposed additional measures, such as hygiene, the installation of thermal scanners to control the temperature of buyers and cancellation of events. According to an estimate by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the pandemic-induced recession could leave between 14 million and 22 million more people in a situation of extreme poverty in Latin America than they had remained in that situation without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the highest point of the Wuhan epidemic, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China’s nearly 300 million migrant rural workers were swept away in their homes in provinces of the interior or trapped in the province of Hubei. By March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government aid.
The outbreak of coronavirus could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate can reach 32%, according to estimates from the Bank of the Federal Reserve of San Luis. The confinement in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (who receive daily wages) unemployed. According to the Angus Reid Institute survey, 44% of Canadian households experienced some kind of unemployment. About 900 000 workers have lost their jobs in Spain since the seizure began in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers requested a universal credit plan. Almost half a million companies in Germany have implemented short-term work schemes subsidized by the Government, known as Kurzarbeit, for their workers.
The German short-term work compensation scheme has been adopted by France and Britain.
The scenic arts and cultural heritage sectors were deeply affected by the pandemic, which affected the operations of organizations and people, both employed and independent, all over the world.
Cultural and arts organizations tried to carry out their mission (often funded by public funds) to provide the community with access to cultural heritage, maintain the security of their employees and the public and support artists when possible.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, venues and other cultural institutions had closed indefinitely, and their exhibitions, events and shows were cancelled or postponed.
In response, great efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent consequence that increases at an accelerated rate of disease is the cancellation of religious services. Important sporting events and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The film industry also suffered interruptions. The Vatican announced the cancellation of Holy Week celebrations in Rome, which take place during the last week of the Lent Christian penance season.
Many dioceses have recommended that older Christians stay in their homes rather than attend Mass on Sundays; some churches have offered religious services through radio, live transmission via the Internet or television, while others offer places to pray from the automobile.
Following the decision of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome to close its churches and chapels and with the Plaza de San Pedro empty of Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also cancelled their services and limited public concentrations in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
The Ministry of Health of Iran announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the areas affected by the outbreak and then closed the shrines, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims and their residents to the sacred places in La Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most significant alteration in the world sports calendar since World War II.
Most major sporting events were cancelled or postponed, among them, the UEFA Champions League 2019-20, the Premier League 2019-20, the UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019-20 season of the NBA and the 2019-20 season of the NHL.
The outbreak interrupted the plans of the 2020 Olympic Games, which were originally scheduled to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event will be - scheduled for a date after 2020 but not after the summer of 2021 - Casinos and other gaming venues around the world closed and online poker tournaments were postponed or cancelled.
This caused many gamblers to resort to the Internet, many online betting sites reported significant increases in their new registration rates. The entertainment industry was also affected, several music groups suspended or cancelled concert tours.
Many large theaters, such as Broadway, also suspended all shows.
Some artists have explored ways to continue to produce and share their work over the Internet as an alternative to the traditional live show, such as live concert broadcasts or the creation of “festivales” on the Internet for artists to interpret, distribute or publish their work.
Online, numerous Internet memes were spread over the coronavirus, as many resort to humor and distraction in the midst of uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudices, xenophobia and racism towards people of eastern Chinese and Asian descent, and towards people in the areas of Europe, the United States and other countries where the situation is critical.
Incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
February reports (when most cases were still limited to China) have documented racist feelings in several groups around the world expressing that the Chinese deserved the virus or were receiving what they considered a fair reprisal.
Some countries in Africa have also seen an increase in ancient feelings.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination on the basis of their regional origin.
The Chinese and those in the areas affected by the virus have received support, both on the Internet and outside the virus.
Following the advance of the outbreak to new countries where the situation is critical, the people of Italy, the first European country that experienced a severe outbreak of COVID-19, could also be the subject of suspicions and xenophobia. Citizens from countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions to achieve the ban on Chinese entry into their countries in an effort to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan was trending on Twitter.
The Chinese, in addition to other Asian people in the United Kingdom and the United States, have reported higher levels of racist insults, as well as aggression.
The president of the United States, Donald Trump, was criticized for referring to the coronavirus as the \"Chinese virus\" a term that many critics considered racist and anti-Cyprus.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainian and foreign evacuees from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
According to reports, students from the northeast of India, who share a border with China, who study in major Indian cities, were harassed in connection with the outbreak of coronavirus.
The president of the state unit of the Bharatiya Janata party in West Bengal, Dilip Ghosh, said that the Chinese had destroyed nature, and that is why God gave up on them.
China's consulate in Calcutta then condemned the comments and said that they were \"false\" in China, increased xenophobia and racism towards non-Chinese residents as a result of the pandemic, and described foreigners as \"foreign bass\" and destined for the \"desict\"
Many newspapers with pay walls have removed them for parts or all of their coverage of the coronavirus.
Many scientific editors published scientific articles related to the available outbreak with open access.
Some scientists have opted to share their results quickly on preprint servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory tests for respiratory disease by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and associated SARS-COV-2 virus include methods that detect the presence of the virus and those that detect antibodies produced in response to the infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed through the chain reaction test of polymerase with reverse transcriptase, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and is designed to detect only the SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
The detection of antibodies (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and monitoring of the population.
The antibody tests show how many people have had the disease, including those who had too mild symptoms to inform them or who were asymptomatic.
Based on the results of this test, an accurate mortality rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity in the population can be determined.
Due to limited evidence, until March 2020, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
As at 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there were large variations in the number of tests carried out in different countries.
It is also likely that this variability is significantly affecting the mortality rates for reported cases, which are likely to be highly overestimated in some countries.
Through the chain reaction of polymerase with reverse transcriptase in real time (rRT-PCR), the test can be done in respiratory samples obtained through various methods, including nasopharyngeal hysopate or spurt samples.
The results are usually available within a few hours to 2 days.
The polymerase chain reaction test with reverse transcriptase performed with pharyngeal hysopates is only reliable in the first week of the disease.
Subsequently, the virus may disappear in the throat, but it continues to multiply in the lungs.
In those infected with the test in the second week, as an alternative, the sample material can be obtained from the deep parts of the airway by sucking catheter, or the material that is expelled from the coughing (spute) can be used.
One of the first polymerase chain reaction tests was developed in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020, using the real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and formed the basis of the 250 000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
As of 23 January 2020, the United Kingdom had also developed a test. On 28 January 2020, the South Korea Kogenebiotech company developed a SARS-COV-2 detection kit based on the clinical grade polymerase chain reaction (PowerChek Coronavirus).
Search for the “E” gene — shared by all beta-coronaviruses and the SARS-COV-2 specific RdRp gene. In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to obtain emergency approval from the Chinese National Medical Products Administration of a SARS-COV-2 detection kit based on the polymerase chain reaction. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are distributing their real-time reverse transcriptase reaction diagnostic panel for the new Coronaryvirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) to public health laboratories through the International Reagent Resource.
One in three genetic tests in the previous versions of the test kits generated unconcluded results due to defective reagents, and a hit in the CDC test in Atlanta; as a result, on average, fewer than 100 samples were successfully processed per day throughout February 2020.
The reliability of the tests using two components was not determined until 28 February 2020, and only from then on were State and local laboratories allowed to begin testing.
The Food and Drug Administration approved the test under an emergency authorisation. U.S. commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
As at 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced national availability of evidence for COVID-19 based on reverse transcriptase chain reaction.
Similarly, as at 9 March 2020, this Diagnostics provided evidence for COVID-19 at the national level.
No limits were announced in the quantity; the collection of specimens and the processing must be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDCs.
In Russia, the evidence for COVID-19 was developed and produced by the State Research Centre for Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Medical Care Monitoring Service. On 12 March 2020, it was reported that Mayo Clinic had developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics was approved by the FDA for a test that could be carried out within 3.5 hours in large volume, allowing a machine to perform approximately 4128 tests within 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued the Emergency Use Authorisation for Abbott Laboratories for a test in Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued similar authorisations for Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid also received the FDA Emergency Use Authorisation for a test that takes approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test using the isothermal acid amplification technology instead of the polymerase chain reaction.
Since this does not require a series of alternative temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Currently, there are about 18,000 of these machines in the United States and Abbott plans to increase production to perform 50,000 tests per day. In Taiwan, a test using a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the nucleopsid protein (protein N) of the new coronavirus is being developed, hoping that it can provide results within 15 to 20 minutes as well as a rapid test for influenza.
In March 2020, the review of the publications concluded that - chest X-rays have little diagnostic value in the early stages, while CT results [computerizedtomography] can be obtained even before symptoms occur -
Typical features in CT include bilateral multilobar opacitys in glass illustrated with a peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution.
As the disease progresses, it develops subpleural domain, pattern in stonework and consolidation.
According to a study conducted in Wuhan, at the point of origin of the current pandemic, in which the polymerase chain reaction was compared with computed tomography, computed tomography is much more sensitive than the polymerase chain reaction, although less specific, and many of the characteristics in the images coincide with the processes of other diseases and pneumonia.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends - not using computed tomography as a detection method or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19 - Since March 2020, the CDCs recommend the polymerase chain reaction as an initial examination.
Part of the immune system reaction to infection is antibody production, including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to detect infection in people approximately 7 days after the onset of symptoms, to determine the immunity and surveillance of the population. Analysis can be performed in central laboratories or by testing at the point of care.
High performance automated systems in many clinical laboratories may perform these analyses, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For analysis in central laboratories, a single peripheral blood specimen is generally used, although serial specimens can be used to follow the immune response.
For the attention-point tests, a single specimen of blood is usually obtained by a puncture into the skin.
Unlike the polymerase chain reaction methods, there is no need for an extraction step prior to the analysis. On 26 March 2020, the FDA appointed 29 entities that provided notification to the agency as appropriate and can now distribute their antibody tests.
As of 7 April 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA under an emergency authorisation. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received approval from Europe for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in the blood samples.
The test capacity is several hundred samples within hours and is therefore much faster than the conventional chain reaction test of viral RNA polymerase.
Antibodies can usually be detected 14 days after the onset of infection. In early April, the United Kingdom found that none of the antibody test kits it bought were good enough to use them.
Hong Kong has created a program in which suspicious patients can stay in their homes, -the emergency department gives the patient a sample tube - the patient spits in the tube, sends it and gets a result soon. The British NHS announced that it is implementing a pilot program to analyze suspicious cases in their homes, which eliminates the risk that the patient will infect others if he or she goes to the hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance if one is used. In the tests in drive-through centres for the COVID-19 of suspicious cases, a health professional takes the samples with the appropriate precautions.
Drive-through centres have helped South Korea to do some of the fastest and most extensive tests in any country. In Germany, the National Association of Health Insurance Doctors Status Insurance said on March 2 that it had a capacity for approximately 12,000 tests per day in the outpatient environment and that 10,700 people had been tested the previous week.
Health insurance assumes the costs when the test is ordered by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a general capacity to do 160,000 tests per week.
On 19 March, evidence was offered through the drive-through system in several large cities.
As at 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown because only positive results were reported.
A first laboratory survey revealed that, in the natural week of 12/2020, at least 483 295 samples had been analyzed, until and including the week of 12/2020, and 33 491 samples (6.9%) had yielded positive results for SARS-COV-2. In Israel, researchers at the Technoion Institute and the Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method to analyze samples of 64 patients simultaneously, consisting of grouping the samples and only making more analysis if the combined sample was positive. On 5 February 2020, in Wuhan, the BGI inaugurated an improvised emergency detection laboratory of 2000 square meters called \"Huo-Yan\" (chin: xxx, or \"Fire Eye\" in English, which can process more than 10,000 samples per day.
With the construction, which was supervised by the founder of the BGI, Wang Jian, and which took 5 days, the model showed that Hubei cases had been 47% higher and that the corresponding cost to cope with quarantine had been doubled without this ability to perform tests.
After the Wuhan laboratory, Huo-Yan laboratories were immediately built in Shenzhen, Tianjín, Beijing and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities in China.
As of 4 March 2020, the total daily production was 50,000 tests per day. Open source multiplexed designs provided by origami analysis were implemented that allow to evaluate up to 1122 samples of patients for COVID19 using only 93 analyses. These balanced designs can be used in small laboratories without the need to use liquid manipulation robots.
By March, the shortage and insufficient amounts of reagents affected massive evidence in the European Union and the US.
This led some authors to explore sample preparation protocols involving heating samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes to do more testing. On 31 March, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was now making more evidence of detection of coronavirus per person in its population than any other country, and was aimed at increasing the level of testing to cover most of the population.
This was achieved by combining drive-through capacity and purchasing a mass production laboratory at Group 42 and BGI population level (which was based on their emergency detection laboratories -Huo-Yan - in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory has the capacity to perform tens of thousands of chain reaction tests of polymerase with reverse transcriptase per day and is the first in the world of this magnitude that works outside China.
Different test formulas were developed that address different parts of the genetic profile of coronavirus in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted the German formula for making kits that sent low-income countries that did not have the resources to develop their own kits.
The German formula was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States was not available until 28 January, which delayed the evidence available in the United States. China and the United States had problems with the reliability of the test kits at the beginning of the outbreak, and these countries and Australia were unable to provide sufficient kits to meet the demand and recommendations of health experts on testing.
On the contrary, experts say that the great availability of evidence from South Korea helped to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The Government of South Korea achieved its ability to conduct tests, mainly in private-sector laboratories, over a number of years.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for the increase in testing programmes as the best way to reduce the progress of the VOC-19 pandemic. The high demand for evidence due to the widespread spread of the virus caused delays of hundreds of thousands of tests in U.S. private laboratories, and supplies of hysopates and chemical reagents were exhausted.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC had - defects - the government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that had prevented private testing. Spain bought test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but obtained inaccurate results.
The company explained that incorrect results could be due to incorrect sample collection or incorrect use of kits.
The Ministry of Spain said it would remove the kits that produced incorrect results and replace them with a different test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic bought from China yielded incorrect results. Slovakia bought 1.2 million kits to China that turned out to be imprecise.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested that they be thrown to the Danube. Ateş Kara, from the Turkish Ministry of Health, said that the test kits that Turkey bought from China had a \"high error rate\" and did not - they did not - put them into use - the United Kingdom bought 3.5 million test kits from China, but, at the beginning of April 2020, announced that they were not serving.
The conduct of tests, complemented by quarantine of those who achieved positive results and the identification of those with whom they had contact who gave positive results in SARS-COV-2, resulted in satisfactory results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the place where the first death occurred by COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two rounds of trials throughout the population of about 3400 people, with about 10 days of difference.
About half of the people who achieved positive results had no symptoms, and all of the detected cases were quarantined.
With the restriction of travel in the municipality, this completely eliminated the new infections.
With the intensive tracking of contacts, restrictions on travel abroad, testing and quarantine, the kronavirus 2020 pandemic in Singapore advanced much slower than in other developed countries, but did not apply extreme restrictions, such as the forced closure of restaurants and retail establishments.
Many events were cancelled, and on 28 March Singapore began to recommend to residents that stay in their homes, but schools reopened in time after the 23 March holiday.
Other countries have also controlled the pandemic with intensive contact tracking, travel restrictions from abroad, testing and quarantine, but with less stringent confinements, such as Iceland and South Korea.
According to a statistical study, countries that have conducted more evidence, in relation to the number of deaths, have much lower lethality rates, probably because these countries have more ability to detect people who only have mild symptoms or who have no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have the capacity to perform tests and that have national laboratories with limited experience in VOC-19 send their first five positive samples and their first ten negative samples for COVID-19 to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmatory testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the column ‘Position as % of evidence’ is influenced by the policy for conducting tests in the country.
A country that only conducts evidence in persons entering hospitals will have a higher number of positive as % of evidence than a country that tests all citizens, whether they show symptoms or not, the other issues are the same.
Handwashing, also known as hand hygiene, is the action of washing hands in order to eliminate dirt, fat, microorganisms or other unwanted substances.
The washing of hands with soap in a constant way in certain - critical moments - during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example, diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted through fecal-oral.
People can also be infected with respiratory diseases, such as flu or common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
The five critical moments during the day when it is important to wash your hands with soap include: before and after the defecation, after cleaning a child's tail or changing diapers, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing a meal or handling raw meat, fish or poultry meat.
If no water or soap is available, hands can be cleaned with ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, during and after preparing meals.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After changing diapers or cleaning a child who used the bathroom.
After the nose sounds, cough or sneez.
After touching animals, feed for animals or animal wastes.
Hand hygiene concerns hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Handwashing before administering medicines or medical care can prevent or minimize the spread of diseases.
The main medical purpose of handwashing is to remove pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause a disease) and chemicals that can cause damage or disease from the hands.
This is especially important for people who handle food or who work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and reduce the infant mortality rate in childbirth at home.
A study conducted in 2013 showed that improvements in hand-washing practices can generate small improvements in height growth of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases can be reduced by the introduction of simple behavioural changes, such as hand washing with soap.
This simple action can reduce the mortality rate for these diseases by almost 50%.
Interventions that encourage hand-washing can reduce diarrhea episodes by approximately a third, and this is similar to providing drinking water in low-income areas.
48% of reductions in diarrhea episodes can be related to handwashing with soap. Hand washing with soap is the most effective and cost-effective way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections, such as automatic behavior adopted in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, a major acute respiratory disease, is the main cause of mortality in children under five years of age, and the lives of an estimated 1.8 million children per year are charged.
Diarrhea and pneumonia together account for nearly 3.5 million child deaths per year.
According to UNICEF, converting handwashing with soap before eating and after using the bath into a deep-rooted habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, which would reduce diarrhea deaths to almost half and a quarter deaths from acute respiratory infections.
Hand-washing usually integrates with other hygiene interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene programmes (WASH).
Handwashing also protects against impetigo, which is transmitted through direct physical contact.
A small detrimental effect of handwashing is that its frequent realization can cause skin damage due to skin dryness.
According to a Danish study carried out in 2012, excessive hand washing can cause a skin condition that causes itching and causes the skin to become squamous known as eczema of hands or dermatitis of hands, which is especially common in healthcare workers.
Handwashing is also considered to be one of the symptoms of compulsive obsessive disorder (TOC).
There are five critical moments during the day when hand washing with soap is important to reduce oral-fecal transmission of diseases: after using the bath (orinary, defecate), after cleaning a child's tail (change diapers), before feeding a child, before eating and before/after preparing a meal or handling raw meat, fish or poultry meat.
Other occasions when a proper hand washing technique should be practiced to prevent the transmission of diseases include before and after treating a cut or wound; after sneezing, coughing or ringing the nose; after touching animal wastes or handling animals; and after touching trash.
In many countries, there is a low hand washing rate with soap.
A hand-washing study in 54 countries conducted in 2015 found that, on average, 38.7% of families practiced hand-washing with soap. A study conducted in 2014 indicated that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate at 97%; the United States was about half of 77%; and China had the lowest rate at 23%. Currently, there are several methodologies for behavioural change, to increase the adoption of the habit of washing hands with soap at critical times. Group washing of children at school at certain times of the day is an option in developing countries to incorporate hand-washing in children's behavior.
The \" Essential Health Care Program \" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of a tailor-made action to promote the health and education of children.
Disposing twice a year, besides washing hands with soap every day, brushing your teeth daily with fluoride is the basis of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Disposal of skin microorganisms improves when adding soap or detergents to water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce barriers to solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is ineffective to clean the skin because fats and proteins, which are components of organic matter, do not dissolve easily in water.
However, a reasonable flow of water facilitates cleaning.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, may contain bacteria acquired in previous uses.
Some studies that analyzed the transfer of contaminated solid soap bacteria concluded that the transfer is unlikely, as bacteria rinse with foam.
Even so, the CDCs claim that - it is preferable to liquid soap with dispensation controls that do not involve the use of hands -
Antibacterial soaps have been actively promoted for a health conscious audience.
Currently, there is no evidence to show that the recommended disinfectants or antiseptics preserve antibiotic-resistant organisms by nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of strains of resistant organisms.
In this way, even if antibacterial soaps do not preserve antibiotic resistant strains, they may not be as effective as it is promoted.
In addition to the surfactant and skin-protecting agent, sophisticated formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as well as pH regulator, benzoic acid with antimicrobial activity and more skin conditioners (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts). An exhaustive analysis of the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that common soaps are as effective as antibacterial soaps for the consumer that contain triclosan to prevent disease and eliminate bacteria from the hands.
Pleasant hot water to wash your hands is not enough to eliminate bacteria.
Bacteria grow much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, warm soap water is more effective than cold soap water to remove natural oils that hold land and bacteria.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using warm water has no effect on reducing microbial load in the hands.
A hand disinfectant or hand antiseptic is a waterless agent for hand hygiene.
At the end of 1990 and in the first part of the twenty-first century, agents for the hygiene of hands without water and alcohol for rubbing (also known as a solution for hands based alcohol for rubbing, antiseptic solution for rubbing or hand disinfectants) began to acquire popularity.
Most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated with a thickening agent such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) in a gel, or a moisturizer such as glycerin in a liquid, or foam for easy use and to reduce the effect of alcohol dryness.
Adding diluted hydrogen peroxide further increases antimicrobial activity. Hand disinfectants containing 60 to 95 % alcohol at least remove germs effectively.
Alcohol-based disinfectants for rubbing remove bacteria, multi-drug-resistant bacteria (SARM and ERVs), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Bleed alcohol disinfectants containing 70% alcohol eliminate 99.97 % (reduction of 3.5 logarithms, similar to 35 decibels) of bacteria in the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99 % to 99.999 % (reduction of 4 to 5 logarithms) of bacteria in the hands 1 minute after application. Hand disinfectants are more effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand disinfectants are virtually ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk)-type viruses, the most frequent cause of contagious gastroenteritis. A sufficient solution for antiseptic or alcohol-based hands should be used to rub, such as to moisten or completely cover both hands.
The palm and the back of both hands, between the fingers and the ends of all fingers are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is dried.
The finger tips should also be washed well, rubbing them in both palms. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend handwashing before hand disinfectants to rub, especially when hands are visibly dirty.
The increase in use of these agents is based on its ease of use and rapid micro-organism elimination activity; however, they should not be used as a replacement for proper hand washing unless water or soap is available.
The frequent use of hand-based alcohol disinfectants may reseal the skin, unless emollients or skin moisturizers are added to the formula.
The effect of alcohol dryness can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand disinfectants containing emollients caused significantly lower skin irritation and dryness than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic dermatitis by contact, contact urticaria syndrome or alcohol hypersensitivity or additives present in alcohol-based hand solutions are very rare.
The least tendency to cause irritant dermatitis by contact was attractive compared to handwashing with soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, waterless agents do not remove organic matter from their hands, but simply disinfect it.
For this reason, hand disinfectants are not as effective as water and soap to prevent the spread of many pathogens, as pathogens remain in their hands.
The effectiveness of hand disinfectants without alcohol depends to a large extent on the ingredients and the formula, moreover, historically, has been much lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based solutions to rub.
More recently, it has been found that the formulas using benzalconium chloride have a persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose efficacy decreases after repeated use, probably due to progressive adverse skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot buy soap and use ash or land instead.
Ashes or land can be more effective than water alone, but less effective than soap.
One concern is that, if land or ashes are contaminated with microorganisms, this can increase the spread of diseases rather than decrease it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant agent, since, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommended using ash or sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.
The correct hand-washing technique recommended by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent disease transmission includes the following steps:
Stir your hands with warm or cold running water.
Current water is recommended because containers with stagnant water can be contaminated, while the temperature of the water appears to make no difference.
Fleet your hands to form foam with a generous amount of soap, including the backs of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails.
The soap removes the germs from the skin, and studies indicate that people usually wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap than when using water alone.
Restrict for at least 20 seconds.
Restregar creates friction, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and restrict for longer periods eliminates more germs.
Swallow well with running water.
Swiming in a container may recontaminated your hands.
Dry with a clean towel or let dry in the air.
Wet and wet hands become more easily contaminated. The parts that are most often forgotten are the thumb, doll, the areas between the fingers and under the nails
Artificial nails and glazed nails can house microorganisms.
Wetting lotion is often recommended to prevent hands from receding; dry skin can cause skin damage that may increase the risk of transmission of infections.
A number of economic options can be used to facilitate hand-washing when there is no running water or soap available, for example, pouring water from a hanging pot or a pumpkin with appropriate holes or using ash if necessary in developing countries. In situations where there is limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions for saving water, such as \"home farms\" and other economic options.
A home tap is a simple technology that consists of using a suspended jug of a soga and a lever with your foot to pour a small amount of water on your hands and a soap into a bar.
The effective drying of hands is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some debate about the most effective form of drying in public baths.
More and more research indicates that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric hand dryers found in many bathrooms.
In 2008, the University of Westminster, London, conducted a study, sponsored by the association of the European Tissue Symposium paper towel industry, to compare the levels of hygiene offered by paper towels, hot-air hand dryers and hand dryers for more modern air jets.
After washing and drying hands with the hot air dryer, it was found that the total amount of bacteria increased, on average, 194 % in the finger yolks and 254 % in the palms.
Drying with the air dryer resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria of 42% in the fingers and 15% in the palms.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total amount of bacteria decreased, on average, by 76% in the toes and by 77% in the palms. Scientists also conducted tests to determine whether there was a possibility of cross-contamination of other users of the bath and the bathroom environment as a result of each type of drying method.
The air dryer, which blows air from the unit at speeds, as stated, of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), managed to blow the microorganisms of the hands and the unit and potentially contaminate other users of the bathroom and the bathroom environment at a distance of up to 2 meters.
The use of a hot-air hand dryer spread the microorganisms up to 0.25 meters away from the dryer.
Paper towels did not show a significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, different methods of hand drying were evaluated.
The following changes were observed in the count of bacteria after hand drying:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers have been compared to drying with paper towels.
Washing your hands with hand disinfectant towels is an alternative during travel, when you have no water or soap.
The alcohol-based hand disinfectant must contain at least 60 % alcohol.
Handwashing of doctors became mandatory long after Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered his effectiveness (in 1846) for disease prevention in a hospital setting.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff to wash their hands when they are forgotten.
One study found a decrease in infection rates with their use.
Washing hands of doctors is done for at least 15 seconds, with plenty of water and soap or gel to form foam and restrict all parts of the hands.
The hands must be narrowed together by interlacing the fingers.
If there are leftovers under the nails, you can use a bead brush to remove them.
Since germs can remain in the water in their hands, it is important to rinse them well and dry them with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the water (and open any exit door if necessary).
This prevents the hands from becoming contaminated again by these surfaces.
The purpose of hand-washing in the medical care environment is to eliminate pathogen-germen microorganisms and avoid transmitting them.
According to the New England Journal of Medicine, the lack of handwashing continues to exist at unacceptable levels in most medical environments, where many doctors and nurses usually forget to wash their hands before touching patients and thus transmit micro-organisms.
One study showed that the correct washing of hands and other simple procedures may decrease the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infections by 66%. The World Health Organization has published a sheet showing hand washing and standard hand rubbing in the health care sectors.
The preliminary version of the organization's guide to hand hygiene can also be found on your website so that the public can comment.
Whitby and others conducted a relevant review.
Commercial devices can measure and verify hand hygiene if a demonstration of regulatory compliance is required.
The World Health Organization has five times for hand washing:
after exposure to blood or body fluids
before a work aseptic and
after taking care of patients. The addition of antiseptic chemicals in soap (jabons, medicine, or -antibacterials - gives the possibility of removing the handwashing agent.
This removal may be necessary before surgery or in environments where antibiotic resistant organisms are very common. To wash their hands before surgery, you need to have a tap that can be opened and closed without touching it with your hands, a little chlorohexidine or iodine for washing, sterilized towels to dry your hands after washing, a sterilized brush to rub and another sterilized instrument to clean under your nails.
All the jewels must be removed.
This procedure requires washing hands and forearms up to the elbow, in general, for 2 to 6 minutes.
It is not necessary to wash for a long time (10 minutes).
When we rinse, the water of the forearms should be prevented from returning to the hands.
After washing, the hands dry with a sterilized cloth and a surgical robe is placed.
To reduce germ spread, it is better to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after caring for sick people.
In order to control infections caused by staphylococcus in hospitals, it has been found that the greatest benefit of hand cleaning is in the first 20% of washing and that there is very little additional benefit when the frequency of hand hygiene increases more than 35%.
Washing with common soap results in more of the triple incidence of bacterial infections transmitted to food compared to antibacterial soap washing. By comparing handwashing with an alcohol-based solution with hand washing with an antibacterial soap for an average time of 30 seconds in each case, it was observed that the alcohol-freight reduced by 26 % more the contamination of bacteria than the antibacterial soap.
However, water and soap are more effective in reducing the influenza A H1N1 virus and Clostridium spores difficult of hands than alcohol-based hand disinfectants. Interventions to improve hand hygiene in health care centers may include training staff on hand washing, increasing the availability of hand disinfectant for alcohol-based hands and written and oral reminders to staff.
There is a need to investigate more about which of these interventions are the most effective in the various health care environments.
In developing countries, it is considered that hand washing with soap is an economic and fundamental tool for achieving good health and even good food.
However, the lack of a reliable supply of water, soap or hand-washing facilities in homes, schools and workplaces makes it a challenge to achieve universal hand-washing behavior.
For example, in most rural areas in Africa, there are very few hand-washing taps near public or private toilets, although there are economic options for building hand-washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates can also be the result of entrenched habits rather than lack of soap or water.
The promotion of handwashing with soap can influence political decisions, raise awareness about the benefits of hand washing and lead to a change in behaviour in the long-term population.
For this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation is necessary.
In a systematic review of 70 studies, it was observed that community approaches are effective in increasing hand-washing in PRBMs, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. An example of promoting hand-washing in schools is UNICEF's three-star approach, which encourages schools to take simple and economic measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
When minimum standards are reached, schools can move from one to, finally, three stars.
The construction of hand-washing stations can be part of the hand-washing promotion campaigns that are being carried out to reduce child disease and mortality.
The World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness campaign that seeks to achieve a change in behaviour. As a result of the 2019-2020 kronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has promoted the creation of an emoji for hand washing.
Few studies have considered the overall cost-effectiveness of hand-washing in developing countries in relation to avoided AVADs.
However, an analysis indicates that promoting hand washing with soap is considerably more effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of handwashing for human health, particularly for people in vulnerable circumstances, such as mothers who have just given birth or soldiers in hospitals, was first recognized in the mid-20th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, English, the \"founder of modern nursing\"
At that time, most people still believed that infections were caused by unpleasant smells called myasmas.
In the 1980s, outbreaks of food-borne diseases and health-care-related infections led the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote hand hygiene more actively as an important way to prevent the spread of infections.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COPID-19 pandemic in 2020 made many countries more aware of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect themselves from these infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, posters were hung with - correct techniques for washing hands - along with the washbasins of public baths and the bathrooms of office buildings and airports.
The phrase - to wash your hands - is a statement that you do not want to take care of something or share the complicity of something.
It originated in the Bible passage of Matthew in which Pontius Pilate washed his hands before the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but has become a much broader phrase of use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins compulsively washing her hands in an attempt to clean up an imaginary stain, which represents her conscience of guilt over the crimes she had committed and which had led her husband to commit.
It has also been found that after remembering or reflecting on unethical actions, people tend to wash their hands more often than others and tend to value the elements for hand washing.
In addition, those people who have allowed themselves to wash their hands after such reflection are less likely to get involved in other, clean-up, compensatory actions, such as volunteering.
Religions recommend the washing of hands for hygienic and symbolic purposes. The washing of symbolic hands, with water, but without soap, is part of the washing of ritual hands in many religions, such as Bahaism, Hinduism, Tevilah and Netilat yadayim in Judaism, the washing of Christianity and the wudu in Islam. Religions also recommend the washing of toilet hands, particularly after certain actions.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam force hands to wash after going to the bathroom.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam force hands to wash before and after every meal.
Risk controls at the workplace before the COVID-19
Risk controls at the workplace before the COVID-19 refer to the application of occupational hygiene and safety methodologies in risk controls for the prevention of coronary virus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The appropriate risk controls at the workplace depend on the workplace and on the job and are based on a risk assessment of the sources of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community and the risk factors of the workers who may be prone to contract COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), work at lower risk of exposure has minimal work contact with the public and workmates, for which basic infection prevention measures are advised, including handwashing, recommendation to workers to stay at home if they are ill, respiratory hygiene standards and maintenance of a routine of cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
Medium exposure risk work includes those in which frequent or close contact is required with people who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19 but who may be infected by current community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, working environments with a high concentration of people and some large retail environments.
Risk controls for this group, in addition to the prevention measures of basic infections, include ventilation with high-efficiency air filters, protective covers and personal protective equipment available in case there is a person with COVID-19.
The OSHA considers that workers in health care and funeral services, exposed to known or suspected to have COVID-19, have a high exposure risk, which increases to very high if they perform procedures that can generate aerosols in people who are known or suspected to have COVID-19 or take or manipulate samples of these people.
Appropriate risk controls for these workers include engineering controls, such as negative pressure ventilation rooms, and individual protective equipment appropriate for work activity.
The outbreaks of COVID-19 may have several consequences in the workplace.
Workers may lack work because they are sick, because they have to take care of others, or because of fear of possible exposure.
Trade patterns may change, both with respect to what goods are demanded and the means of purchasing such goods (such as buying in hours that are not peak, by means of home-to-home or window-to-mobile delivery services).
Finally, shipments of articles from geographical areas seriously affected by the COVID-19 could be interrupted. A plan of preparation and response to infectious diseases can be used to guide preventive measures.
The plans address risk levels related to various workplaces and work activities, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from domestic and community environments and risk factors for individual workers, such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
They also describe the controls necessary to address those risks and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of outbreaks.
Plans for the preparation and response of infectious diseases may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
The objectives of the response to an outbreak include reducing the transmission among staff members, protecting those who are at greater risk of adverse health complications, maintaining trade operations and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community in which the company is located affects the measures taken.
The hierarchy of risk controls is a widely used framework for hygiene and occupational safety to classify risk controls according to their effectiveness.
If the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are the engineering controls, followed by the administrations and, lastly, the individual protection teams.
Engineering controls involve insulating employees of work-related hazards without resorting to the behaviour of workers and may be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative controls are changes in labour policies or procedures requiring action by the worker or employer.
Individual protective equipment is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can help prevent some exposures.
All types of individual protective equipment must be selected according to the hazard for the worker, placed as appropriate (e.g. the breathers), used in an appropriate and systematic manner, reviewed often, received maintenance, replaced if necessary and removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of correctly to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA), work at lower risk of exposure has minimal work contact with the public and colleagues.
The measures for the prevention of basic infections recommended for all workplaces include thorough and frequent hand washing, recommendation for workers to stay at home if they are sick, respiratory hygiene standards that include coughing and sneezing, provision of paper and container panels for waste, preparation for teleworking or staggered shifts if necessary, deterring workers from using foreign tools and equipment, and maintenance of a routine for cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
The immediate identification and isolation of people who may be infected is a fundamental measure to protect workers, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory disease stay in their homes until they cease to have fever, signs of fever and any other symptoms during at least 24 hours without taking medication to alleviate symptoms or decrease fever; that sick leave policies be flexible and allow employees to stay home to care for a sick relative, and that employees know these policies.
According to OSHA, work at medium exposure risk includes those that require frequent or close contact at less than six feet (1.8 m) with persons who are neither known nor suspected to have COVID-19, but who may have been infected with SARS-COV-2 due to the Community transmission of the moment around the location of the company, or because the person recently made an international trip to a place with widespread transmission of COVID-19.
These include workers who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, work environments with a lot of people and some large retail sales environments. Engineering controls for this group and the higher risk groups include the installation of high-efficiency air filters, the increase of ventilation rates, the installation of physical barriers such as transparent plastic protective decks and the placement of a window for the service of care so that the customer can not be at risk from the car. Administrative controls for this group and the risk groups include recommending to sick workers who stay at home, replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual communications, setting up shifts for the service of care so that the travel is not essential to the sites with existing CVID-19 outbreaks, developing emergency communications plans that include a forum to respond to workers' concerns, provide up-to-date training for workers on other risk factors and the risk-to-use of the risk-to-use avoidance, providing a minimum amount of duty to be used by the workers, which are able to engage in order to provide for workers and to engage in terms.
Workers in this risk group should rarely use respirators.
If a person gets sick on a plane, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include separating the sick person from others at a distance of 6 feet, appointing a crew member to attend the sick person and offering a mask to the sick person or asking him or her to cover his or her mouth and nose with paper cloths when coughing or sneezing.
The cabin crew should use disposable surgical gloves to serve a sick passenger or to play body fluids or possibly contaminated surfaces and, perhaps, individual protective equipment if the sick passenger has fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items must be disposed of in a bag for hazardous biological waste and contaminated surfaces must be cleaned and disinfected later. In the case of commercial navigation, such as cruises and other vessels carrying passengers, risk controls include delaying the journey by illness, self-insulation and immediately informing the medical centre on board if someone has fever or other symptoms while on board.
The ideal is for medical control to be done in the cabin of the isolated person. In the case of schools and child care centres, the CDCs recommend the short-term closure to clean or disinfect if an infected person was in the school building, regardless of community transmission.
When community transmission is minimal or moderate, social distance strategies can be implemented, such as canceling excursions, assemblies and other mass meetings, such as physical or choir education classes or meals in the dining room, increasing space between desks, staggering entrance and exit hours, limiting visits that are not essential and using a separate place for the health room for children with flu-like symptoms.
When there is a significant transmission in the local community, in addition to social distance strategies, it may be considered to extend the cancellation of classes. For the staff of police forces carrying out daily routine activities, the CDCs consider that the immediate risk to health is low.
Police officers are advised to contact persons with confirmed diagnosis or suspicions of COVID-19 following the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including the use of personal protective equipment.
If there is close contact during a detention, workers shall clean and disinfect their work belt and equipment with an aerosol or household cleaning towels before re-use and follow the standard operating procedure for the containment and disposal of personal protective equipment and the containment and washing of clothing.
OSHA considers that certain health workers and morgues are within high or very high risk of exposure.
Among the high risk of exposure, there are those of the delivery workers, support, laboratory and medical transport who are exposed to patients with confirmed diagnoses or suspicions of COVID-19.
These become very high-risk exposure jobs if workers perform aerosol generation procedures in patients with confirmed diagnoses or COVID-19 suspicions or if they take or manipulate samples of these patients.
Some aerosol generation procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations, or invasive sampling.
High-risk exposure morgue work includes those in which workers are involved in the preparation of corpses of people who had COVID-19 or who were suspected to have it at the time of death; these become very high risk of exposure if they perform autopsies. Additional engineering controls for these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with confirmed diagnosis or suspicions of COVID-19, even when they are carried out by aerosol generation procedures.
Specialized ventilation with negative pressure can be adequate in some medical care and morgue environments.
Samples should be manipulated by taking Biosafety Level precautions 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients entering should be separated into different waiting rooms depending on whether or not they are suspected to have COVID-19. In addition to other types of personal protective equipment, the OSHA recommends the use of masks for those working at a distance of up to 6 feet from patients who have been infected or suspected to have been infected with SARS-COV-2 and those who perform aerosol generation procedures.
In the United States, N95 respirators should be used with a filter mask approved by NIOSH or higher in the context of a written comprehensive respiratory program that includes adjustment tests, training and medical examinations.
Other types of masks can provide greater protection and improve the comfort of the worker. WHO does not recommend the use of protective monkeys, since COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, not one that is transmitted by body fluids.
WHO recommends only the use of a surgical mask for the classification staff of patients who enter.
For those who take respiratory samples of patients with COVID-19, give them attention or transport them without performing aerosol generation procedures, the WHO recommends the use of surgical masks, glasses or facial protector, robes and gloves.
If an aerosol generation procedure is performed, the surgical mask should be replaced by a N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Because the supply of personal protective equipment is insufficient, WHO recommends minimizing the need to use them, replacing them with telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, limiting the entry permit to the room of a patient with VOID-19 only those involved in their direct care, using the same mask without removing it while paying attention to several patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the supply chain of personal protective equipment and discouraging the use of masks by asymptomatic people.

QUESTION: [Covid-19] To lighten the burden and prepare us for the future
DATE/END: 14 March 2020, 00:24 h, coordinated universal time
LICENCE: CC0: No rights reserved.
This month, we are in unique circumstances.
The COVID epidemic-19 highlights our global human interconnection and the responsibilities we have with each other.
The challenges presented are unprecedented, but we know that our best response lies in the empathy, cooperation and overall community building that make up the core of this organization.
The camaraderie and concern we have seen among all our peers in email messages, calls and conversations is a great validation of how amazing the people we are lucky to work with.
I couldn't feel more gratitude and pride that you're all my comrades.
Last week, someone shared with me the appreciation he felt for our work.
I was reminded how important it is for the world to be able to go to Wikipedia at this time and the powerful symbol that is the fact that this critical resource remains online and available to everyone.
His work makes this possible, either by keeping the sites in operation, by helping our peers to receive their payment or by keeping our communities safe.
The world needs the information Wikipedia provides, today more than ever.
This is a moment when not only what we do but the way we do it will have a profound effect on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and its role in this, from this next week, we will make some important adjustments to the way we work together.
Adjustments to our work and our schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, Team C met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the next few days and months.
In that conversation, we consider what we believed would be an appropriate response to what we are facing and what would be the best way to maintain the sustainability of the organization at this time.
To a greater extent, we wanted to eliminate stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to slow down, it's okay.
For all staff, contractors and contract workers:
our daily work expectations will be around 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week, until next notice.
We are not declaring a holiday; if you can work on a more normal schedule, this would be of great use to the mission.
However, the world is an unpredictable place now, and whether it has to take care of its loved ones, shop or go to the doctor, our priority is its well-being.
We're not keeping track of your hours.
If you're sick, don't work.
Although I shouldn't have to say it, we say so.
It is not necessary to apply for sick leave or paid free time; just inform your manager and help your team review the schedules and schedules to ensure that the key areas of the work are covered.
(If you receive a positive diagnosis of COVID-19, notify Bryan of T&C Operations, so that T&C can help with the support and ensure that management is aware of your situation).
People who work for an hour will receive full payment.
As we have said, we renew our commitment to our contractors and staff partners who work per hour.
All will be paid on the basis of their normal hours worked under normal circumstances.
This also applies if you are sick and cannot work.
If you want to work, you have our support.
Many people use work as a way to channel their stress with the world around us.
What we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in these times.
Again, it is your personal care.
What we ask you to communicate with your manager so that we know what to expect and can adapt correctly.
Certain work is considered essential.
There are some things we must continue to do.
Site Reliability Engineering Teams, Human Resources Operations, Confidence and Security and Fundraising, among others, perform critical work that may require additional support.
We will begin a process with all departments to assess current objectives and modify our approach in order to support what is essential to our mission.
There are enough tasks for all of us; the only difference is that we will all focus on the most essential projects.
Reducing speed today will not harm us tomorrow.
We don't plan to double the hours to catch up when the pandemic ends.
You will not be expected to work extra hours to meet deadlines that are no longer realistic.
We accept that the circumstances have changed and we will work to establish new goals and deadlines when appropriate.
What about the APP, or Annual Planning?
To adjust to our new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we plan to adjust the schedule for the delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Planning.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan to allocate more time to the budget so that employees can prioritize critical work, personal care and care for loved ones as we adapt to the needs of those who need or wish to work with a reduced schedule for the next few weeks.
This extension of our schedule greatly reduces current planning burdens and pressure throughout the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and we will communicate the next steps to the delegates and to the teams we will not have a confirmation.
Thanks to the APP team for their leadership in this situation.
Status, exhibition and cleaning of the office
Last week we learned that one of our colleagues in the San Francisco office might have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, as a precautionary measure, we hired an antiviral cleaning equipment to disinfect all surfaces of the San Francisco office.
They used an antiviral solution for hospital use to disinfect all surfaces, in addition to reception and lifts that go to our apartment.
The building has adopted its own protocol of duty of care, using products that support the safety of its occupants.
We feel confident that the office will be well prepared for when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in a WeWork, which has shared its protocol for COVID-19 with us and all staff members in DC offices.
Since last week, our DC office has moved its operations to a completely remote environment in accordance with the patterns shared with San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York City already know, we have also talked about renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions are still ongoing but may take a long time.
Some of our peers work remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who have already worked remotely since then know that this mode requires an adaptation, so they offer the following suggestions:
Limit the duration of meetings at intervals of up to one or two hours.
If longer sessions are required, consider how to section them over a number of days.
Clearly define the meeting with a list of topics and send the reading materials in advance.
Adopt the use of the video by default, using tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and live connection.
Design a leader to moderate each meeting, a person who controls questions in the chat and the list of speakers, and someone who helps take notes (or take notes collaboratively).
Send an email to technical support if you need comfortable headphones.
Use the wellness refund for refreshments.
Join the #remotes channel in Slack to talk to your colleagues about the distributed work
The HR HR Operations team is analyzing the guidelines on ergonomics based on web seminars to support the increase in the work distributed throughout the Foundation.
This past week we asked all beneficiaries of community grants to cancel the public events funded by Wikimedia, such as the editorials, until WHO declares the end of the pandemic.
We informed them that we understood that our request for cancellations and other restrictions could make it impossible for them to fulfil their share of the activities agreed for the grant and that there would be no penalty for delaying or modifying those objectives.
This week we will follow up with additional guidelines at Wikimania and other community and regional thematic conferences.
The general feeling of the community at the global level seems to be, in part, sadness over the interruption and, in part, relief from clarity and the ability to focus on their own communities, both those of Wikimedia and others.
Later, CRT will be working to set up a page on Meta-Wiki in order to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and follow our communications with them.
Maintaining contact with the issues of COVID-19
We will send you an invitation through your calendars for next Thursday, 14:00 a.m., coordinated universal time/07:00 a.m., Pacific time, for a special staff meeting.
We will take this opportunity to share additional news, answer your questions and spend time connecting with each other.
We are together on this and we are available to help in the way we can.
Meanwhile, you can still find the information of this email message and all the additional essential information related to COVID-19 in Office Wiki.
CRT will keep these pages up-to-date and all information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communications with staff living in countries currently largely affected.
If you have any questions about travel, events, an important workflow, some coverage problem or anything you may need help with, don't hesitate to notify CRT and work with them.
We're here to help provide support and function as a link when necessary.
If you have confidential or sensitive matters, send an e-mail to Bryan Judah, Director of Global Operations International RR. HH.
None of these changes should be considered a abandonment of our work and our obligations.
Instead, they are a recognition that, at this time, our work and our obligations should probably be adapted in a way that had not happened before.
These are the measures we believe necessary to support each other in order to continue working, to give our movement the necessary support and to give the world the service it trusts.
Our planned work will remain there for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to support each other and make room for important work that will come in the coming weeks and possibly in the coming months.
We need all of you to make this possible and, therefore, we need them to care for and care for their families so that they can find themselves in the best state possible when the need arises.
Now, please, wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S) and the rest of the Leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
The converting enzyme of angiotensin 2 (ECA2) is an enzyme that adheres to the outer surface (cell membranes) of the cells of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ECA2 counteracts the activity of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) related by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing angiotensin (1-7), which makes it a therapeutic target for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ECA2 also serves as a point of entry to the cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is usually called hECA2.
The converting enzyme of angiotensin 2 is a metaloenzyme containing zinc and is located on the surface of endothelial cells and other types.
The ECA2 protein contains an N-terminal domain of peptide M2 and a C-terminal renal transporter domain of amino acids of collectrin.
ECA2 is a type I unipasal membrane protein, with its enzymatically active domain exposed on the surface of the cells of the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ECA2 is excreted from the transmembranal domain by another enzyme known as shedasa and, as a result, the soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and is ultimately excreted by the urine.
ECA2 is present in most organs: ECA2 is primarily attached to the cell membrane of the type II alveolar cells of the lungs, to the enterocytes of the small intestine, to the venous arterial and endothelial cells and to the arterial cells of the smooth muscle of most organs.
The term mARN of ECA2 is also found in the cerebral cortex, striated body, hypothalamus and brain stem.
The main function of ECA2 is to counter the ECA.
The ECA turns off the angiotensin I hormone and forms angiotensin II, which is vasoconstrictor.
In turn, ECA2 turns off the carboxyl-terminal phenylalanine amino acid of angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzeses it to form vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ECA2 may also have several other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradiquinin, apple, neurotensin, dinorphine A and greline.
ECA2 also regulates the membrane traffic of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and has been associated with Hartnup's disease.
As a transmembranal protein, ECA2 serves as the main entry point for some coronaviruses, including HCOV-NL63; SARS-COV (the virus causing SARS); and SARS-COV-2 (the virus causing COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of SARS-COV S1 and SARS-COV2 spin protein with the enzyme domain of ECA2 on the surface of cells results in endocytosis and transfer of the virus along with the enzyme to the endosomes within the cells.
This input process also requires the preparation of S protein by the patient's TMPRSS2 protease serine, the inhibition of which is currently being investigated as possible therapy. This has led to certain assumptions that reducing ECA2 levels in cells could help fight infection.
However, a number of professional associations and regulators have recommended continuing standard ACE and BRA inhibitory therapy.
A systematic meta-analysis review published on 11 July 2012 found that - the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant reduction of 34 % of the risk of pneumonia compared to control cases -
In addition, the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients who received treatment with ACE inhibitors and who had a higher risk of pneumonia, particularly those with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were not so solid for the overall risk of pneumonia -
Recombinant human ECA2 (rhECA2) seems to be a new therapy for acute lung injury and seems to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in lechones with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The mean life of rhECA2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes in addition to the 24 hour duration of effect.
Several findings suggest that rhECA2 could be a promising medicine for those with intolerance to classical inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS inhibitors) or for diseases in which angiotensin II is elevated circulating. rhECA2 infusion was evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The applications of the COVID-19 are software applications for mobile devices designed to help with the tracking of contacts in response to the 2019-2020 kronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying people - contacts - who might have been in contact with an infected person.
Various applications were developed or proposed with official support from the government in some territories and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks have been developed for the creation of contact tracking applications.
Privacy concerns have been raised, in particular, with regard to systems that are based on tracking the geographical location of the application users.
There are other less invasive alternatives, such as the use of Bluetooth signals to record a user's proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Apple and Google jointly announced that they would integrate functionality to support such Bluetooth-based applications directly into their iOS and Android operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, together with Alipay, has implemented an application that allows citizens to verify whether they have been in contact with people who have COVID-19.
It is already in use in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore an app called TraceTogether is being used.
The application was developed by a local IT community, was launched as an open source application and will be handed over to the government. In North Macedonia, a Bluetooth based application was launched to track exposure to potentially infected people and provide a quick response to health authorities.
The implementation was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting approval from Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government reported that the implementation of contact tracking was at an advanced stage of development and that it would be available for implementation in the coming weeks. A similar application is planned in Ireland and France-StopCovid.
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on the TraceTogether application and the BlueTrace protocol of Singapore. Russia plans to introduce a geoperimetering application for patients living in Moscow who have received a diagnosis of COVID-19, designed to ensure that they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Safety Engineering at Cambridge University, presented several potential practical problems with application-based systems, including false positives and the possible lack of effectiveness if implementation is limited to only a small part of the population.
In response to concerns about the spread of ‘coronavirus’ applications, misleading or harmful, Apple limited the types of organizations that can add kronavirus-related applications in its App Store to organizations — officers — or trusted only.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates expressed concern about the consequences of massive surveillance through the applications of the coronavirus and, in particular, about the dismantling of the infrastructure created to deal with the kronavirus pandemic once the threat passes.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations submitted a statement demanding limits on this type of surveillance.
The organizations established eight conditions for government projects:
surveillance should be - illegal, necessary and proportionate -
expansions in monitoring and monitoring would have to have extinction clauses;
the use of data should be limited to COVID-19-related objectives;
security and anonymity should be protected and there should be evidence of this protection;
digital surveillance should avoid exacerbating discrimination and marginalization;
any exchange of data with third parties should be defined in the laws;
protections against abuse should be implemented and citizens' rights established to respond to such abuse;
The significant participation of all relevant stakeholders, including public health experts and marginalized groups, will be mandatory. The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen, RSF) of Germany also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to address the problem of persistent surveillance by removing the tracking mechanism from its operating systems when no longer required.
In some countries, a network-based location trace was used, rather than applications, which eliminated both the need to download an application and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was adopted.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data present significant potential privacy problems.
However, it is not necessary for all systems with central servers to have access to the personal location data; several privacy protection systems that use central servers only for intercom (see next section).
In South Korea, a system was used that is not based on an application to carry out the tracking of contacts.
Instead of using a specific application, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and credit card transaction data, and combined them to generate warnings through text messages for potentially infected people.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government has also made the location information available to the public, which is allowed due to the wide-ranging changes to information privacy laws after the MERS outbreak in that country.
This information is available to the public through various applications and websites. Some countries, including Germany, considered using centralized and privacy protection systems.
As of 6 April 2020, details have not yet been published.
The tracking of privacy-protected contacts is a well-established concept, with a large number of published research going back to at least 2013. On 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as the use of low-energy Bluetooth (BLE) to record a user's proximity to other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that contains both centralized and decentralized approaches and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized proximity tracking to preserve privacy (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, formerly known as contact event numbers, CEN) and protocols and mechanisms for mobile contact tracking for privacy protection (PACT), among others.
In these protocols, personal identification data never leave the device and all matching occurs on the device.
The MIT Media Lab Privacy Group has been developing SafePaths, a platform for using techniques that protect privacy by collecting and using path location or intersection data to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on the research of the technical report - Applications out of control: how to maintain personal privacy during an epidemic - published in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform of Enigma MPC, a company that develops privacy technologies that was also originally founded in the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies that allow its users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials, without compromising the privacy of such data.
On 5 April 2020, a number of groups united around what was essentially the same approach and with highly coincident protocols formed the Global TCN Coalition with the aim of reducing fragmentation and allowing global interoperability of tracking and alert applications, a key aspect in achieving broad adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the government of Singapore announced that it had opened the BlueTrace protocol code used by its official government implementation.
On April 10, 2020, Apple and Google, the companies that control iOS and Android mobile platforms, announced an initiative for tracking contacts that, as they ensured, would protect privacy, which is based on the combination of low-energy Bluetooth technology and privacy encryption.
They also published the specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be implemented in three stages:
implementation of tools for governments to create official coronavirus tracking applications that protect privacy
integration of this functionality directly into iOS and Android. Google and Apple plan to address the adoption and persistent surveillance problems by distributing, first, the system through operating system updates and then removing them in the same way once the threat has passed.
b'The reperfilation (also known as repositioning or therapeutic change) is the readaptation of a drug approved for the treatment of a disease that is not the one for which it was originally developed.
This is in line with scientific research currently seeking to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research lines include the development of a VOC-19 vaccine and covalent plasma transfusion. SARS-COV-2 has approximately 66 chemomodulable proteins, each of which has multiple binding sites with the ligand.
The analysis of these binding sites provides a reasonable basis for the project to develop an effective antiviral drug against VOC-19 proteins.
Among the most important DNA proteins of SARS-CoV-2, there is the papaine-like protease, RNA-directed polymerase, helicase, S protein and ADP ribophosphate.
Hussein A. A. et al. studied several medical-interest compounds that then optimised and analyzed to identify the similarity of their main chain with the most approved drugs that were similar in order to accelerate the development of a potent drug against SARS-CoV-2 in their preclinical study and recommend it for the design of a clinical study.
Chloroquin is an antimalarial drug that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs to be studied in the clinical trial Solidarity.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that the trials of the state of New York with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on 24 March. On 28 March, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulphate and chloroquine phosphate by means of an urgent authorisation (USA).
Treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorized according to a US only as an experimental treatment for urgent use in patients who are hospitalized but who cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDCs said that - the use, dose or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-COV-2 infection - are not yet established.
Doctors have said they use the drug when - there is no other option -
A Turkish research team in Istanbul conducts a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
At Duke University and Oxford University, large studies are under way.
The NYU Faculty of Medicine is conducting a test on the safety and effectiveness of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen showed that favipiravir was - clearly effective -
Thirty-five patients in Shenzhen were negative on an average of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study in Wuhan in 240 patients with pneumonia, half of them received favipiravir, while the other half were given umifenovir.
The Italian Medicines Agency reminded the public that the existing evidence supporting the drug is scarce and preliminary.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan for its reservations and that it would use the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals, where it would be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has made proposals to the Trump Administration on the purchase of the drug. The drug can be less effective in serious cases of the disease if the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or who try to conceive.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir antivirals, concluded that - no benefits were observed -
The drugs were designed to inhibit the replication of HIV by joining the protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drugs to find a compound that joins the SARS-CoV-2 protease. In the scientific community, criticism has emerged about the allocation of resources to the rehabilitation of drugs specifically developed for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the International Solidarity Trial.
The remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences later discovered that the remdesivir had in vitro antiviral activity against multiple phylovirus, neumovirus, paramixovirus and coronavirus.
One problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that may result in a more serious disease and transmission.
Some pre-test studies suggest that remedisiveness may have a high genetic barrier against resistance. Several clinical trials are ongoing, including two conducted by hospitals at the University of Cleveland; one conducted for people with a moderate disease and one conducted for those with a more serious disease.
Three intravenous vitamin C clinical trials are under way for hospitalized and severely affected by CVID-19; two placebo-controlled (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
The state of New York began testing with the Azithromycin antibiotic on 24 March 2020.
Japan's National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning a clinical trial with Alvesco (cyclesonide) of Teijin, an inhalable corticosteroid for asthma, as treatment for asymptomatic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
A form of angiotensin 2 converting enzyme, a phase II trial is under way and 200 serious patients will be enrolled in hospitalizations in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine to reduce inflammation and lung complications in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called COLCORONA, is enrolled in 6000 adults aged 40 and older with a diagnosis of COVID-19 and mild symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Pregnant women, who are breastfeeding or who do not have an affective contraceptive method, are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being evaluated in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, so the Italian Medicines Agency published guidelines on their use.
On 14 April, a multicenter study was announced in Italy with 300 patients investigating the use of sodium enoxaparin in preventive and therapeutic doses.
As SARS-COV-2 is a virus, scientists are paying close attention to the readaptation of antiviral drugs that developed for previous outbreaks of SROM virus, SARG and West Nile.
Ribavirin: ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Humifenovir: Humifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
These are some treatments that were identified for possible readaptations for the treatment of COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (block the IL-6 receptor): approved by China.

b'A vaccine against COVID-19 is a hypothetical vaccine against coronary virus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, there are many ongoing attempts to develop this vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that it did not expect there to be a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease, in less than 18 months.
In April, five possible vaccines were in phase I safety studies.
The COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
An important outbreak spread throughout the world in 2020, triggering significant investments and research activity to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use the genomes published to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
Established in April, the requirements of the CEPI initiative for the development of a vaccine are speed, manufacturing capacity, scale implementation and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were under investigation and developing at the beginning of 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Among the main platforms that went to phase I security studies are the following:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (phase I developer and possible vaccine: Modern, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (phase I developer and possible vaccine: CanSino Biologics, type 5 adenovirus vector)
According to CEPI scientists in April, 115 potential vaccines are in the early stages of development, 78 of which are confirmed in active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute) and 37 of them are announced, but with little information available (it is presumed to be planned or being developed).
A phase I or II trial conducts preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, is usually randomized, is placebo-controlled and is performed at several sites, while determining more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including a control group, and assess the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent the disease, while controlling the adverse effects of the optimal dose.
Of the 79 active development vaccines (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 were not yet in human assessment (continued in the research-preclinical).
Around 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was investigating the potential of a vaccine with molecular subjection that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate the immune reaction.
Around 24 January 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) of the University of Saskatchewan announced the start of work in a vaccine and hopes that human testing will begin in 2021.
Projects for the development of vaccines were announced at the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention in China on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
About 29 January 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that they had begun to develop a vaccine.
Janssen is co-developing an oral vaccine with his biotechnological associate Vaxart.
On 18 March 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing association with Vaxart for the development of the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a document with a design for a vaccine with technology similar to that used in the treatment with neo-antigenic cancer vaccines.
On 25 March, the head of the research institute announced that they had completed the synthesis of the vaccine and that they were starting the tests.
On 27 February 2020, a subsidiary of Generex, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that he was starting a project to create a li-key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a possible vaccine that could be tested in humans - within 90 days -
On 5 March 2020, the University of Washington in San Luis announced its projects to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Material Command in Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army of Research in Silver Spring, both in western Maryland, announced they were working on a vaccine.
By March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it had joined Novavax Inc.
in the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
The partners also announced plans for a clinical trial and a phase I clinical trial by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that it was working with 11 isolated persons and that, although moving fast, it would take at least one year and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported the development of a coronavirus-like particle with partial funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
The possible vaccine is at the laboratory research stage and human testing is expected to begin in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that U.S. President Donald Trump had offered CureVac -'great amounts of money for exclusive access to a COVID-19 vaccine - before which the German Government complained.
On March 17, 2020, the U.S. pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop an RNA-based vaccine.
The possible BNT162 RNA-based vaccine is currently in preclinical testing and clinical trials are expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy, on March 17, 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it will have the results of preclinical tests in April 2020 and that human testing of the possible final vaccine could begin in the fall.
In France, on 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Innovations in Epidemic Preparation (CEPI) announced an investment of USD 4.9 million in an alliance to investigate a vaccine against COVID-19 that includes the Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, leading to the total investment of CEPI for the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 to USD 29 million.
The other partners of CEPI for the development of a VOC against COVID-19 are Modern, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford and the University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists began testing in animals of six possible vaccines.
Researchers at the London Imperial College announced on 20 March 2020 that they were developing an RNA vaccine with self-replication against COVID-19.
The possible vaccine was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequence of China.
At the end of March, the Canadian Government announced an CAD 275 million funding for 96 medical measures research projects to counter COVID-19, which includes a large number of potential vaccines in Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago initiatives and the University of Saskatchewan.
More or less at the same time, the Canadian Government announced the use of CAD 192 million specifically to develop a VOC-19 vaccine, with plans to create a \"national vaccine bank\" with several new vaccines that could be used if another coronavirus outbreak occurs.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh Medical School announced the trials of PittCoVacc, a possible vaccine against COVID-19, in mice and said that - SARS-COV-2 subunit S1 vaccines administered by MNA received powerful responses from antigen specific antibodies (in mice) that were evident two weeks after vaccination -
In Canada, on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo's Faculty of Pharmacy announced the design of a possible DNA-based vaccine as a probable nasal sprayer.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be designated to replicate within human bacteria and produce virus-like innocuous particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the Government, the industrial sector and three U.S. universities gathered resources to access IBM supercomputers, along with computing resources in the cloud of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have non-specific effects.
That means they can have benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Another randomised trial in Australia seeks to register 4170 health workers.
The vaccines being developed may not be safe or effective.
Initial research to assess the effectiveness of vaccines with animal models specific to the COVID-19, such as the transgenic mouse expressed by ECA2, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, shows the need for level 3 biosecurity containment measures for the handling of live viruses and with international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
The vaccines against SRAG and SROM have been tested in non-human animal models.
By 2020, there is no cure or vaccine to protect against SARG that has proven to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research publications from 2005 to 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicines to treat the SARG was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world, and there is also no confirmed vaccine against SROM.
When SROM was generalised, it was believed that existing research on SRAG could be a useful template for developing vaccines and anti-infection treatments for MERS-COV.
As of March 2020, one SROM vaccine (based on DNA) completed phase I clinical trials in humans, three others were in progress, all of which are viral vector vaccines, two adenoviric vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one VAM vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Publications on social media promoted a conspiracy theory that the virus causing COVID-19 was known and there was already a vaccine.
Patents cited by various social media publications refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronavirus strains, such as the RAG coronavirus.
b'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, sore throat, loss of smell and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but may vary between two and fourteen days.
While most cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to viral pneumonia and multi-organic failure.
As at 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases were reported in 210 countries and territories, with more than 153 000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus is mainly spread among people during close contact, usually through droplets that occur when coughing, sneezing or talking.
While these droplets occur while exhaling, they usually fall on the floor or on the surfaces, rather than being contagious over long distances.
People can also be infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces up to 72 hours.
It is more contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although propagation is also possible before the symptoms appear and in late stages of the disease. The standard method for diagnosis is the polymerase chain reaction with inverse transcription in real time (rRT-PCR) of a nasopharyngeal hysopate.
The use of masks is recommended for those who suspect that they have the virus and its caregivers.
Recommendations on the use of masks for the general public vary. Some authorities recommend that they be not used, others recommend that they be used, while others require their use.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment against COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries in the six WHO regions.
Those who are infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or have flu-like symptoms, such as fever, cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, pain or persistent pressure in the chest, confusion, difficulty walking and face or blue lips. If these symptoms are presented, it is recommended to seek medical attention immediately.
It is less common to observe symptoms in the upper respiratory tract, such as sneezing, nasal drip and throat pain.
Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, have been identified in varying percentages.
Some cases in China initially presented oppression in the chest and palpitations.
In some, the disease progressed to pneumonia, multiorganic insufficiency and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period of the COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but may range from two to fourteen days.
97.5% of people with symptoms do so within 11.5 days of infection. Not all infected people have symptoms, according to reports.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers is not yet fully known; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they can contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people who do not have symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied. Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during hospitalization.
The National Health Commission of China began to include asymptomatic cases in daily cases on 1 April. Of the 166 infections of that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic when the test was carried out.
Both sputum and saliva can have large viral loads.
Talking out releases more droplets than talking to a normal volume.
A study in Singapore found that not covering your mouth when coughing can cause droplets to travel 4.5 metres (15 feet).
Although the virus is not usually airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that transmission through biological aerosols is possible and explained that air collectors in the corridor outside the dormitory of people gave positive in viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as cardiopulmonary intubation and resuscitation (CPR) may lead to aerosolization of respiratory secretions and, consequently, air transmission.
While there are concerns about the possibility of spread over stools, it is believed that the risk is low. The virus is more contagious when people have symptoms; although the spread is possible before the onset of symptoms, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) explains that although it is not clear how easy it is to spread, a person usually infects two or three more.
Specifically, the virus was detected during one day in the carton, up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours in products with 99 % copper.
However, this varies according to humidity and temperature.
The soap and detergent are also effective if used in the right way. The soap products degrade the protective lipid layer of the virus and disable it, as well as remove it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzoalconium chloride and chlorohexidine glucanate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken on an average of two days after the initiation of hospitalization.
In five of six patients, the first sample had the highest viral load. In the case of the sixth patient, the highest viral load was observed on the second day of testing.
The coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2) is a new coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected with a group of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
All characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the coronaviruses of related nature.
Outside the human body, the domestic soap kills the virus, as it revives its protective bubble. SARS-COV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-COV.
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19, due to the virus entering host cells through the converting enzyme of type I angiotensin (ECA2), which abounds more in type II alveolar cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called \"spicle\" (peplomer) to connect to ECA2 and enter the host cell.
In 12% of infected people hospitalized in Wuhan, China, acute cardiac injury was identified, which is most common in severe disease.
Cardiovascular symptoms rates are high, due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease evolution, but acute myocardial injury may be related to ECA2 receptors in the heart.
ECA2 receptors have a high expression in the heart and participate in its functioning.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was detected in ICU patients with CVID-19 virus infections and may be related to a poor prognosis. In the autopsies of people who died from VOC-19, diffuse alveolar damage (ADD) and inflammatory infiltrates with lymphocytes in the lungs were detected.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropism by epithelial cells that express ECA2 of the airways, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammatory.
In particular, it was observed that the secretive T lymphocytes of GM-CSF pathogens correlate with the recruitment of secretory IL-6 monocytes and severe pulmonary pathology in patients with COVID-19.
Lymphocytic infiltrates were also reported in the autopsys.
WHO has published several test protocols to detect the disease.
The standard test method is the polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcription in real time (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually done in samples of the airways obtained through a nasopharyngeal hysopate; however, samples of nasal hysopate or spurt may also be used.
The results are usually available within a few hours or two days.
You can also use blood tests, but you should take two samples of blood with two weeks of difference and the results have very little immediate value.
Chinese scientists managed to isolate the coronavirus strain and published the genetic sequence so that the world's laboratories could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect virus infection.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody tests (which can detect active infections and if the person was infected in the past) were developing, but were not widely used.
China's experience with testing has shown that accuracy is only 60 to 70 %.
The FDA in the United States approved the first immediate diagnostic test on 21 March 2020 to use it at the end of that month. The diagnostic guidelines published by the Zhongnan Hospital at Wuhan University suggested methods for detecting infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Opacities in bilateral multilobular emerylated glass with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution are common in the initial stages of infection.
As the disease progresses, subpleural domain may appear, pattern in disorder (lobular septal thickening with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation.
Few data are available on microscopic lesions and physiopathology of COVID-19.
The main pathological results of autopsies are as follows:
Macroscopy: pleuritis, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary oedema
Four types of viral pneumonia severity can be observed:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, hyperplasia of the pneumocytes, atypically large pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytes infiltration and formation of giant cells with multiple nuclei
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (ADD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is causing acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) and severe hypoxemia.
healing pneumonia: organization of exudates in alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular clotting (CID); leukoerythoblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home, avoiding places with many people, washing hands with water and soap frequently for at least 20 seconds, having good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth without washing your hands.
The CDCs recommend covering the mouth and nose with a handkerchief when coughing or sneezing and, in case of not having handkerchiefs, use the inner part of the elbow.
Appropriate hand hygiene is recommended after coughing or sneezing.
The CDCs have recommended the use of cloth caps in public places, one of the reasons is to limit the transmission by asymptomatic people. Social distance strategies seek to reduce the contact of people infected with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and canceling multiple public meetings.
Distance patterns also indicate that people must maintain a distance of 6 feet (1.8 m).
There is no effective medicine to prevent COVID-19. Since there is not expected to be a vaccine until 2021, as soon as possible, a key part to controlling COVID-19 is to try to prevent the epidemic peak, which is known as - flattening the curve -
The CDCs also recommend hand washing frequently with water and soap for at least 20 seconds, particularly after going to the bathroom or when the hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after the nose, coughing or sneezing.
They also recommend the use of an alcohol-based hand disinfectant with a minimum of 60% alcohol, but only when there is no water and soap available in time. For areas where hand disinfectants are not easy to achieve, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, antimicrobial activity results from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; -it is not an active substance for hand antisepsis -
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
Patients are given support care, which may include rehydration, oxygen therapy and treatment for other vital organs affected.
CDCs recommend that those who suspect that they have the virus use a simple mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (OMEC) has been used to address the problem of respiratory failure, but the benefits are still being analysed.
To improve immunity, personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet have been recommended.
Support treatments can be useful for those who have mild symptoms at the initial stage of infection. WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for the care of people hospitalized with COVID-19.
Intensivists and neologists in the U.S. compiled the recommendations of several agencies on a free resource, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For the initial treatment of symptoms, some medical professionals recommend paratamol (acetaminophen), rather than ibuprofen.
Caution should be taken to minimize the risk of virus transmission, especially in health care environments when procedures are carried out that can generate aerosols, such as intubation or manual ventilation.
The CDC recommends that health care professionals who care for people with CVID-19 place the patient in an air infection isolation area (AIIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions and precautions to avoid air transmission. CDCs highlight the guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (EPP) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is EPP, mask, protective jackets and medical gloves. When available, the respirators are preferred (in lieu of masks).
The N95 masks are approved for industrial environments, but the FDA authorized their use through an urgent use authorisation (USA).
They are designed to protect against particles that are in the air, such as dust, but the effectiveness against a specific biological agent that is not stipulated in the product's indications is not guaranteed.
Where no masks are available, the CDCs recommend the use of protective masks or, as a last resort, home masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not serious enough to require mechanical ventilation or alternatives, but a percentage of cases are.
This type of respiratory support is being actively studied for patients hospitalized with respiratory failure related to COVID-19 and there is already some evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high-flow nasal cannula or positive bipression in the airways.
It is still not known whether either of these offers the same benefit to people in critical state.
Some doctors prefer to use invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to the high-flowing nasal cannula. Severe cases are mainly reported in adults older than 60 and, in particular, those over 80 years of age.
Many developed countries do not have sufficient beds per head in hospitals, which limits the health system's ability to handle the sudden increase in severe cases of COVID-19 requiring hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% was admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support and 1.4% died.
In China, approximately 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are finally transferred to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex when a patient with COVID-19 has acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) and oxygenation is becoming increasingly difficult.
Respirators that have different pressure control modes and PPTE are needed to maximize oxygen supply, while minimizing the risk of lung injury associated with the respirator and pneumothorax.
Older respirators may not rely on high PPTE.
Research into possible treatments began in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
The rendezvous seems to be the most promising.
Although the development of new medicines may delay until 2021, several drugs that are being tested are already approved for other uses or are in advanced testing.
Antiviral medicines can be tested in people with severe disease.
WHO recommends that volunteers participate in tests on the efficacy and safety of possible treatments. The FDA granted temporary authorization to covalent plasma as experimental treatment in cases where the person's life is at serious and immediate risk.
It has not been submitted to the clinical studies necessary to demonstrate whether it is safe and effective for a disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to deal with the outbreak of the disease.
Users must enter their name and identification number.
The application can detect “close contact” and therefore a potential risk of infection through surveillance data.
Each user can also control the status of three other users.
If a possible risk is detected, the application not only recommends self-financing, but also alerts local health officials. Analysis of cell information macrodata, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence is used to track infected people and those with whom they were in contact in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli Government allowed security agencies to track data on mobile phones of persons suspected of having coronary virus.
The measure was taken to strengthen quarantine and protect those who can contact infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared the summary data on the location of telephones with the German federal government agency Robert Koch Institute in order to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia implemented facial recognition technology to detect quarantine violations.
Regional health commissioner Giulio Gallera said mobile phone operators have informed her that, in any event, 40% of people continue to travel.
The German Government conducted a 48-hour weekend hackaton with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a worldwide application for creative solutions against the spread of the coronavirus.
People may experience distress over quarantine, travel restrictions, and side effects of treatment or fear of infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying: \"The growing social isolation, loneliness, anxiety for health, stress and economic problems are a perfect storm to the mental health and well-being of people\"
The disease can follow a mild evolution with few or no symptoms, so it will look like other diseases of the upper respiratory tract, such as common cold.
Mild cases usually recover within two weeks, while severe or critical cases may take three to six weeks to do so.
Pregnant women may be at risk of contracting a serious CVID-19 virus infection, according to data from other similar viruses, such as SRAG virus and SROM, but the data from COVID-19 are insufficient. In some people, COVID-19 may affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In the most serious cases, COVID-19 can progress rapidly to the respiratory distress water syndrome (SDRA) that causes respiratory failure, septic shock and multi-organic failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, coagulation disorder, and cardiac, renal and hepatic damage.
Coagulation alteration, specifically the increase in protombin time, has been reported in 6% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19; while renal function alteration is observed in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20 to 30 % of people with CODEV-19 have elevated liver enzymes (aminotransferases).
According to the same report, the mean time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five days of hospitalization.
However, for patients transferred to the ICU, an average time of seven days elapsed between hospitalization and death.
In a study of incipient cases, the mean time from the manifestation of the first symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full range of 6 to 41 days.
In a study by China's National Health Commission (NHC), the male mortality rate was 2.8% and among women was 1.7%.
Histopathological examinations of postmortem samples of the lungs show diffuse alveolar damage with cell fibromixoids exuded in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes in the pneumocytes were observed.
The image of the lungs resembled acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA).
In 11,8% of the deaths reported by the China National Health Commission, cardiac damage resulted from elevated levels of troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to the United States March data, 89% of hospitalized people had a pre-existing condition. The availability of medical resources and the socio-economic aspects of a region may also affect mortality.
Estimates of disease mortality vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
The insufficient count of mild cases can cause the mortality rate to be overestimated.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of cases in the past may indicate that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of CVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely to need intensive care or die compared to non-smokers. They worry about the long-term sequelae of this disease.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20-30% decrease in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and images of the lungs suggest organ involvement.
This can also cause intensive care after recovery.
By March 2020, it was unknown whether previous infections generated an effective long-term immunity in those who recovered from the disease.
It seems that immunity is possible, based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but recovered cases have been reported from the COVID-19 that subsequently gave positive in coronavirus.
These cases are believed to be a worsening of a persistent infection and not a reinfection.
This virus is considered to be natural and of animal origin through an interspecific infection.
The real origin is not known, but by December 2019, the spread of the infection was almost entirely due to transmission among humans.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of CVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, noted as the first date of onset of symptoms as at 1 December 2019.
Official WHO publications reported that the first manifestation of symptoms was on December 8, 2019.
In general, several measures are taken to quantify mortality.
These figures vary by region and in time, in addition to being affected by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, the treatment options, the time elapsed from the initial outbreak and the characteristics of the population, such as age, sex and general health.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned emergency CIE-10 disease codes U07.1 to deaths with confirmation of SARS-COV-2 and U07.2 to deaths with a clinical or epidemiological diagnosis of COVID-19 without confirmation of SARS-COV-2 infection laboratory. The lethality rate reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed in a given time interval.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the overall mortality rate is 6.9% (153 822/2 240 191) to 17 April 2020.
The number varies by region. Other measures include the lethality rate in diagnosed patients (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed individuals who die from a disease, and the lethality rate in infected persons, which reflects the percentage of people infected (with or without a diagnosis) who die from a disease.
These statistics do not depend on time and follow a specific population from infection to resolution of cases.
While not all infected people produce antibodies, their presence can provide information on how many people have been infected.
At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small villa of 4600 inhabitants, 80 (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, his illness spread during carnival festivals and affected the younger, so there was a relatively low mortality, and it is possible that not all deaths by COVID-19 were classified as such.
Moreover, the German health system has not been overtaken.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population has antibodies, as determined by blood donors.
It has been confirmed that 69 (0,004% of the population) died from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the mortality rate are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher among males in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The greatest risk for men is for those who are in their 50s, and the gap between men and women is narrowed only at 90 years of age.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 in males and 1.7 in females.
The exact reasons for this difference by sex are not known, but it could be due to genetic and behavioral factors.
Immune gender-based differences, the lowest number of women smoking, and the fact that males have common conditions, such as hypertension, at an earlier age could have contributed to the highest mortality rate in males.
In Europe, 57% of the people infected were males and 72% of those killed by COVID-19 were males.
As of April 2020, the U.S. Government does not track gender information in CVID-19 virus infections.
Research shows that viral diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and RAS, affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of health workers, in particular nursing staff, are women, and have more possibilities for exposure to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease would be \"COVID-19\"
WHO head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO refers to crown, VI to virus, D to disease and 19 to the date when the outbreak was discovered: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g., China), animal species or group of people, in line with international recommendations raises a name to prevent stigmatization. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called a coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2).
In addition, WHO uses the “COVID-19 virus” and “COVID-19 virus” in public communications.
It is common to use -coronavirus - to refer to both the disease and the virus.
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, it was common to refer to the virus and disease as \"coronavirus\" and \"Wuhan cornavirus\"
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCov and respiratory disease water for 2019-nCoV as temporary names for the virus and disease, as indicated by 2015 not to use locations in the name of viruses and diseases.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-COV-2 were issued on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing health material, such as nasal hysopos and parts of respirators.
For example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed the valve of a respirator and the supplier could not deliver it at the required time, a local emerging company performed reverse engineering and printed the 100 valves needed during the night.
After the initial outbreak of the COVID-19, conspiracy theories, false information and misinformation about origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease that spread rapidly over the Internet emerged.
It seems that humans can transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study found no evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks or chickens.
No medicines or vaccines are approved to treat the disease.
Government organizations, academic groups and researchers in the sector are conducting international research on vaccines and medicines for COVID-19.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the SOLIDARITY Test to assess the therapeutic effects of the four most promising existing antiviral compounds on efficacy.
There is no vaccine, but several agencies are actively developing possible vaccines.
Previous work on SARS-COV is being used because SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2 use ECA2 receptor to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are under investigation.
First, researchers seek to develop a complete virus vaccine.
The use of this virus, whether inactive or dead, aims to generate a rapid immune response of the human body to a new infection by the virus of COVID-19.
A second strategy, subunit vaccines, seeks to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on the S protein that helps the virus to get into the receiving ECA2.
A third strategy is nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique for creating vaccines).
Experimental vaccines of any of these strategies should be studied to determine their safety and efficacy. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine with four volunteers in Seattle began.
The vaccine contains an innocuous copy of the genetic code of the virus that causes the disease. It has been suggested that antibody-based improvement is a potential challenge for the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccines, but this is controversial.
As of April 2020, there are more than 300 active clinical trials.
Seven studies evaluated treatments already approved for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Readapted antiviral drugs constitute most of China's research, including nine phase III trials on remediation in several countries and which are due to report at the end of April.
In April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical developments on vaccines and possible drugs against COVID-19 was under way. A number of antiviral medicinal products for the treatment of COVID-19 were evaluated, including the following: resurgence, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with interferon-beta.
As of March 2020, there is evidence of attempts to improve the effectiveness of the re-desiver.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with the compassionate use of rendezvous.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the U.S., China and Italy. Chloroquina, which was previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020. The results were preliminary.
However, there are requests for peer review for research.
The health authorities of Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, although the Wuhan Virology Institute recommends a daily dose of one gram, it points out that twice that dose is very dangerous and could be lethal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an urgent authorisation for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of doctors treating patients with COVID-19. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes the use of interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are needed to inhibit SARS-COV-2 in vitro.
Further in vivo Nitazoxanide studies have been recommended after determining that low concentrations inhibit SARS-COV-2. Studies have shown that the initial S-protein onion that performs type 2 transmembrane serine protein (TMPRSS2) is essential for the input of SARS-COV-2 through interaction with the receiving ECA2.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have important limitations that prevent the medical community from taking these treatments without further studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and does not have a known function in the treatment of COVID-19.
The release of cytokines can be a complication of the last stages of the severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have properties that prevent the release of cytokines. China’s National Health Commission included tocilizumab in treatment patterns after the completion of a small study.
It is in a non-randomized national test in phase II in Italy after observing positive results in people with severe disease.
It is expected that, in combination with a serum ferritin blood analysis to identify cytokines release, it counteracts these effects, which are believed to be the cause of death of some infected people.
The FDA approved the interleukin-6 receptor antagonist based on past cases for the treatment of steroid-resistant cytokine release syndrome induced by another cause, the treatment of T-CAR T lymphocytes in 2017.
To date, there is no unrandomized controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system of those recovered from COVID-19 to those in need as a passive immunization method without vaccines is being investigated.
This strategy was tested with the SRAG with non-conclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the mechanism of action expected through which passive antibody treatment can defend against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms are possible, such as antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity or phagocytosis.
Other forms of passive antibody treatment are being developed, for example, using monoclonal antibodies manufactured.
The production of convalent serum, which consists of the liquid part of the blood of recovered patients and contains specific antibodies against this virus, could be increased to achieve a faster distribution.
Coronavirus Diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, who later died from COVID-19 after raising awareness about the spread of the virus.
