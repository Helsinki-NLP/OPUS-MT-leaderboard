This not only confirms that at least some of the dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already well accepted, but also offers details that are not so often found in fossils, such as colors and the three-dimensional arrangement.
. Scientists claim that the upper plumage of this animal was brown and the lower part was clear or carotenoid.
The discovery also provides clues to the evolution of feathers in birds.
Dinosaur feathers, known as raccoons, do not have a well-developed stem, but have other characteristics, such as barbs and barbels. In view of this, the researchers concluded that the raccoon was possibly the result of an evolutionary development subsequent to these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight, but rather, to display or regulate the temperature. The researchers suggested that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample has the plumage of an adult, and not that of a puppy.
The researchers suggested that despite the tail being from a young dinosaur, the sample reveals an adult plumage, not a down.
Yesterday morning, a car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty others.
The governor's office said 19 of the injured were police officers.

They found that the sun operated on the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all the stars in the system was determined by their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing else.
The luminosity and rotation are used together to define the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the flow of plasma.
The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star is when it comes to magnetic inversions.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made by the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a pull on the Earth, causing the tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
This theory states that most of the dark matter in the surroundings of a galaxy is located in the surroundings of a galaxy in a kind of halo and is composed of several tiny particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
He warned that the new variant was "very worrying and alarming because of the high mortality rate" in an interview.
According to Dr. Moll, some patients may have contracted the virus in the hospital and at least two were health professionals.
Within a year, an infected person can infect between 10 and 15 close contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the full group of people with tuberculosis still appears to be low; 6,000 out of a group of 330,000 individuals infected at any one time in South Africa.

Infrared images show that the temperature variations from night to day indicate that they are probably caves.
They are colder than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
"Their thermal behavior is not as stable as the large caves on planet Earth, which tend to preserve a fairly constant temperature, but it is consistent with the fact that they are deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the U.S. Geological Survey's Astrogeology Team and the University of Northern Arizona in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and deposit a pre-printed sheet indicating the candidate of their choice in an envelope.
After the officials verify the identity of the voter, the voter inserts the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting list.
The French electoral law codifies the procedures quite rigorously.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent, so that voters and observers can witness that no envelopes are present at the beginning of voting and that no envelopes are added, except those of duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to observe all parts of the process. During the night, votes are counted by volunteers under careful supervision, following specific procedures.

Her other race, the Giant Slalom, took tenth place in the women’s sitting group with a combined result of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 slower than Australia’s Claudia Loesch and 1:09.02 minutes slower than Hungary’s ninth-placed Gy<0xC3><0xB6>ngyi Dani.
Four female skiers failed to finish their races, and 45 of the 117 female skiers in the Giant Slalom failed to qualify for the race.
Police in Madhya Pradesh recovered the stolen laptop and cell phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said: "We arrested five people who raped the Swiss and recovered their cell phone and laptop."
The defendants were named as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
The accused appeared in court with his face covered, said police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki.
Although three people were inside the house when she was hit by the car, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services released the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was initially hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has been at the Edinburgh Sheriff’s Court ever since, charged with the murder of her son.
She is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any eyewitness evidence could be compromised because her image has been widely publicized.
This is a common practice in other parts of the UK, but Scotland’s justice system acts differently, and courts consider the publication of photos to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson, from the University of Dundee, notes that “journalists seem to go in a dangerous direction when they post photos, videos, etc. of suspects.”
The Crown Office, which is in general charge of the proceedings, has told journalists that no further comment will be made, at least until the indictment.
The document, according to the leak, will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants based on the borders before the Six-Day War in 1967.
Other issues covered include the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel requires a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to leave that presence for only five years.
The shooters in the supplemental pest control test were closely supervised by the forestry engineers while the test was monitored and its effectiveness was evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited, according to the Sporting Shooters Association’s hunting program.
According to Mick O’Flynn, NPWS Acting Director of Conservation and Park Heritage, the four shooters selected for the first hunting operation were given comprehensive safety and training instructions.
Yesterday, Martelly promised a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
It is Martelly's fifth post code in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the prior resignation of the CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country toward new elections.
The commission was Martelly’s response to the general protests against the regime, which began in October.
The occasionally violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some scheduled since 2011.
About 60 cases of iPods with overheating problems have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with mild burns.
Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI disclosed that Apple had informed it of 34 more overheating incidents, which the company classified as “non-serious.”
The ministry responded by calling the postponement of Apple’s report “truly regrettable.”
The earthquake hit Mariana at 7:19 a.m. local time. In GMT time, it was Friday at 9:19 p.m.
The Northern Marianas emergency management office said there was no reported damage in the country.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman hijacked a tourist bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and held them hostage in Hong Kong.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were freed earlier, as well as Filipino photographers.
Then the photographers later took the place of an old lady who had to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot dead.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered a career in medicine.
He was educated as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
Although he was working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature births in his spare time.
Their research demonstrated that if a hormone was administered, it would accelerate the fetal lung maturation of the baby.
Xinhua said government investigators recovered two “black boxes,” flight data recorders, on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said that "Luna was the first Queen of the Extreme. My first businesswoman. Luna passed away in a night with two moons. Something exceptional, just like her. Strong woman."
Dustin Goldust Runnels once said, “Luna was as crazy as I was...or maybe even more...I loved her and will miss her...if only she was in a better place.”
Among the 1,400 people interviewed before the 2010 federal election, the percentage of those opposed to the change in Australia to become a republic has grown 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 campaign for the national election that she believed Australia would become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four per cent of those who took part in the survey share this view, wishing Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia’s last monarch.
In the extremes of the survey, 29% of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim in the 100 and 200-meter freestyles and three Commonwealth Games relays, but due to his complaints, his physical condition was called into question.
He was unable to take the necessary medications to overcome the pain, since these are banned at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at Central Missouri University, discovered the largest known prime number as of January 25.
Several people proved the discovery using different types of hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets were a source of water distribution to earth along with organic matter that can develop proteins and make life possible.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, since comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his government earlier this year and signed a law last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as being "politics and nonsense"
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
The NextGen is a system that the FAA says would let aircraft fly on shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon production.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide more accurate information to pilots.
There will be no extra transport and surface trains will not stop at Wembley. Parking and public transport connections will not be available.
The problem of lack of transport increased the possibility that the game had to be played behind closed doors, without the presence of the fan.
On Thursday, the journal Science published a study reporting the discovery of a new species of bird in the Galápagos Islands, Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the US and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although this process was believed to take much longer, due to breeding between an endemic Darwin finch, Geospiza forts, and the immigrant finch cactus, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked in any kind of shape. It can even be rolled into small shapes.
It is possible to stretch to form a fine thread, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be very thin and glued to another metal. Because it is so thin, it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called chemical PH. You can make a marker using purple cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two powders and, with clean hands, mold them into the shape of a ball.
The moisture in the hands reacts with the outer layers, which causes a strange sensation and forms a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had a flush toilet seat in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remaining parts of sewage systems have been found in the homes of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in Ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of the public toilets, frequented by both men and women.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you’re using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then redirects it back, almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts part of our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket more than 100 feet tall to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing the wheel did for us was give us a much easier and faster transport.
He gave us the train, the car and various other forms of transportation.
Below them there are medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including loose pet cats) that eat small animals, much more numerous, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The revelation to their success is the concept of niche, a special function that each cat does that prevents them from competing with each other.
Lions are the most social felines, living in large groups called packs.
The flocks consist of one to three adult males from the same family, along with up to 30 females and cubs.
Women are usually closely related to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion packs act similarly to groups of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
A well-balanced athlete, the tiger can climb (although not well), swim, jump great distances and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as the lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the roar of a lion, but more like a phrase of shouted and growled words.
The jaguars like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the jaguar hunts are much smaller than it.
Scientists believe that the jaguars follow and find their prey by smell, sniffing where they have been by the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and can also move stealthily. Jaguars hunt their prey by mixing with the environment around them and then attack their prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) separates from the main population from which they came (for example, if they transpose a mountain range or a river, or if they go to an island from which it is not possible to return easily), they often find themselves in an environment different from the one in which they lived before.
This new environment has different resources and new competitors, so the new population will need to acquire different characteristics from those it already has and adapt to become a strong competitor.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it becomes less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe in and absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e., exhale)
Plants use the sun as their food through photosynthesis. They also offer shade.
We build our houses using plants and make our clothes using plants. Most of the food we consume is plants. Without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
The Mosasaur was the alpha predator of his era, so the only thing he feared were other Mosasaurs.
Their long jaws were studded with more than 70 sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the roof of their mouth, which shows that nothing that crossed their path could escape.
We're not sure, but he may have had a forked tongue, his diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and he may even have been a cannibal.
He also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex would not be a match for him.
Although most of their food was familiar to us, the Romans still had their share of strange or unusual foods, such as wild boar, peacock, snail and a type of rodent called arganaz.
Another difference was that while the poor and the women ate seated in chairs, the rich men enjoyed holding banquets together where they lay on their side as they ate their meals.
Food in ancient Rome did not include provisions originating in America and Asia for Europe, as it did in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians made a primary temple for each of their gods, who were considered the home of their respective gods.
People brought sacrifices to the gods, and priests sought to meet the needs of these gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an internal sanctuary into which only priests could enter.
Sometimes, special pyramids shaped like towers, called ziggurats, were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the Hebrew family life took place in the open air.
The women cooked in the courtyard, the shops were just open counters facing the street. Stones were used in the construction of the houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
In the Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, while traveling west, found Greenland and gave it that name.
But regardless of their discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there at the time.
Although all countries were "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you’ve ever seen the movie The Legend of the Lost Treasure, you may find that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776." The text appears in the lower corner of the document, upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its existence, the large parchment document (it measures 293<0xE2><0x81><0x84>4 inches by 241<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 inches) was rolled up to be stored.
Thus, it is likely that a note was simply added as a label.
The landings and subsequent battles on D-Day liberated the north of France, but the south was not yet free.
It was ruled by the French "Vichy". They were Frenchmen who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion being called "Operation Dragon".
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were turning toward Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a significant large group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and which also, in some way, defines the size of society.
Cities-states are the precursors of nations. The culture of civilization implies the transfer of knowledge for different generations, a lasting cultural reach and a fair dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without adequate historical evidence and are no longer recognized as civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government—the Congress being its only component—according to the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked the power to exact tribute, and because there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on state authorities, who generally did not cooperate, to enforce all of its laws.
In addition, there was no authority to repeal tax laws and tariffs between states.
The Articles required unanimous consent among all states before they could be amended, and the states gave so little importance to the central government that their representatives were almost never present.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national team, is the second most successful in the world and was the winner of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has about 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to, in a geographical position, as an "archipelago"
The foundation of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when Europeans who sailed through the region named the place as Formosa Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company opened a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation in Aboriginal grain production practices and employing Chinese to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty forces (1644–1912) seized control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was recovered, and this recovery continues to this day.
As an example, the most common form of still image photography on the planet is 35mm, which was the size of film that had the most in circulation at the end of the analog film era.
Currently it is still produced, but the most important thing is that its proportion has been inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually confusingly 36mm wide by 24mm high.
The screen ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to get the lowest ratio between integers) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are the same or very close to this ratio.
The rather abused and often demoralized law of third parties is a fairly simple guideline that provides a dynamic while maintaining a relative order in a figure.
According to him, the intersection of the lines that divide the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see the example) is the most effective place for the main subject.
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has united the European states, despite differences in language and customs.
Everyone was affected by his influence, from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church’s monetary funds are there specifically for that reason.
The central leadership of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this principle was being fulfilled.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy has proven effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although that blockade has violated generally accepted international regulations and provisions in various international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain has mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire areas of the ocean, bringing danger even to neutral-flagged ships.
Germany, since there was limited response to this tactic, expected an attack similar to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were those of pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wished to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States penniless, with a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (the head of his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of demonstrating different eras; each stage of China or each family that was in power was a distinct dynasty.
In addition, between each dynasty there was an unstable era of divided provinces. The best known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms era, which occurred for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, a fierce war occurred between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of Ancient China, thousands of people died fighting to sit on the throne of the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
In addition, after the Revolution, vacancies were opened to all male candidates, enabling the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same goes for the military, since instead of patents being based on social class, they were now based on character.
The French Revolution also inspired many other repressed working class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond worldly life. He used to frequent a cave that became known as 'Hira' on the mountain of 'Noor' (light) for contemplation.
the cave itself, which has survived the times, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's religious inclinations.
Resting atop one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find it, even if you know it exists. Once inside the cave, it is a total isolation.
It is not possible to see anything but the clear blue sky above and the mountains around. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the world that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor dead pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or the "Necropolis of Giza", in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, has several pyramids (among which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu’s wives and relatives.
The "bow pointing up" mark has its similar appearance with a V, and the "bow pointing down" mark has its similar appearance with a clip or a square without the bottom side.
Cima means you should start at the tip and push the bow; bass means you should start at the bead (which is where you hold the bow) and pull the bow.
In general an upward arc produces a softer sound, while a downward arc produces a louder and more assertive sound.
You can write your own notes, but don’t forget that printed bow notes exist for a musical reason, so these should be respected.
On 6 October 1789, the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, her two young children (Marie Thér<0xC3><0xA8>se, aged eleven, and Louis Charles, aged four) and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of market women.
In a carriage, they traveled back to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd of people forced the King and Queen to keep the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point, a protester waved the head of a dead royal guard at Versailles in front of the queen, terrified.
The war expenses of U.S. imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino population itself.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to pay a large portion of the expenses and interest on floating-rate bonds on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the superprofits that stem from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the basic gains of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The time when such events occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period of European history between the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Late Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a range of ideas in practice, from the supply of technology or the technological imperative to a strict notion that human destiny is determined by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: the first, is that technological development itself follows a path that goes beyond cultural or political influence; the second, is the idea that technology, in turn, has "effects" on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one can say that the automobile necessarily results in the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for just a few cars, so new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass car ownership leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new techniques in the healthcare system to heal injured bodies.
Romanticism had a great element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
Geography, in the context of Romanticism, caused citizens to be shaped and that, over time, customs and culture linked to this geography emerged, which, being in harmony with the place of society, became better than the eventually mandatory laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as the epicenter of luxury began around 400 A.D. and lasted until about 1100 A.D.
Its status declined during the 12th century mainly because Crusaders returned bringing gifts such as silks and spices, which were worth more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the title of Fashion Capital of Constantinople was transferred to Paris.
The Gothic language reached its peak in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and also in the 14th century.
At first, the costumes were heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the eastern region.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the west can lag behind for 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advances for the time was that as a result of the crusades, people began to use buttons to close their clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture carried out to produce enough food to meet only the needs of farmers and their families.
Subsistence farming is a simple, usually organic system that uses stored seeds native to the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize production.
Historically, most farmers have been involved in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in most developing nations.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinct due to age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or sex of members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their affiliation through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, mannerisms, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to resort to the few unfortunate cases of children who were, through neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse, not socialized by adults while they were growing up.
Some of these children were confined by people (usually by the parents themselves); in some cases, the abandonment of this child was due to the rejection of the child by the parents because of his or her severe intellectual or physical disability.
Children who are outraged may have suffered serious trauma or abuse in childhood, before being abandoned or running away from home.
Others are supposed to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived on their own in the jungle.
When fully raised by animals, the wild child exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to those of the particular pet, such as its fear or indifference toward humans.
While project-based learning makes learning easier and more interesting, the scaffolding method goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a help for students who are going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer or starting a new project.
The scaffolds can be virtual or face-to-face, in other words, a teacher can be considered a scaffold, just like that little Microsoft Office talking clip.
The virtual scaffolds are internalized in the software with the aim of questioning, alerting and explaining procedures that can be challenging for the student to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster homes for a multitude of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment that does not nurture, care for, and educate, but it does.
We see the Family Care System as a safety zone for these children.
Our adoption platform has a duty to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, regular education and guaranteed medical care.
Adoptive care is supposed to meet all the needs that were missing in the home from which it was taken.
The Internet combines elements of both interpersonal and mass communication.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approach to uses and gratifications.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are indicated as important motivations for internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "relationships with continuity" were also identified as new motivating characteristics by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied public reactions to web pages.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that a person can detect whether another person is lying through the correct interpretation of microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President’s Speech, pointed out how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are nevertheless able to evaluate sincerity accurately.
He even suggests that such interpretive skills of human behavior can be shared by animals like domestic dogs.
Research from the 20th century has concluded that there are two ways of genetic variation: secret and manifest.
Mutation adds a new genetic variation and selection removes it from the cluster of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two bases with each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans, consuming the available plant resources, to satisfy its amino acid requirements.
In addition, failure to act accordingly has serious consequences: severe depression, malnutrition and, ultimately, death.
The plant-based resources with greater accessibility would be the proteins in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult for us primates to digest unless they are cooked.
However, foods of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide proteins in large quantities that contain all the essential amino acids.
Taking all this into account, it wouldn’t be surprising if our own ancestors solved their “protein problems” more or less the way today’s savanna chimpanzees do.
Sleep disruption is a process of purposely waking up during the normal period of sleep and falling asleep soon after (10–60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a half-quiet alarm clock to bring him to consciousness without waking him up at all.
If you find yourself resetting the clock while you sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other possibilities based on biorhythm include drinking plenty of liquid (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bedtime as it forces the person to get up to urinate.
A person’s level of inner peace correlates in the opposite way to their level of bodily and spiritual tension.
The lower the tension, the more positive the present life force. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that gets in the way of that goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but have been amplified by the Mahayana path of love and by many Indian Yoga techniques.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the all-encompassing path of love.
With Kundalini Yoga, kundalini energy (enlightening energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The central part of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleared, the chakras are activated and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common villain in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the US. With the end of the war, system clashes, processes and cultures led to the disintegration of countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies, and the Cold War began.
The goal was to last for the next 40 years and, in fact, there would be replacement troop leadership on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already destroyed and the only way out was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international, bilateral and multilateral treaties.
The use of ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient means of moving people and goods on a large scale across the oceans.
The work of the navies has traditionally been to ensure that their country maintains the ability to displace population and assets while at the same time interfering with the ability of their enemies to move their own people and assets.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the Battle of the North Atlantic of World War II. The Americans were trying to displace men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy organization, mainly using U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have the ability to conquer Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to maintain them in order to facilitate access to milk, hair, meat and skins.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often cared for by shepherds who were usually children or adolescents, similar to the better-known shepherd. These methods of herding are still used today.
Wagonways were built in England from the 16th century.
Although the wagons consisted only of parallel wooden planks, this allowed the horses to pull them to reach higher speeds and carry larger loads on the slightly more bumpy roads.
Sleepers were implemented at the very beginning, to keep the rails in place. Gradually, however, it was realized that the rails would be more efficient if they had a metal cover on top.
This became common practice, but iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The first known means of transport was walking. Humans began walking upright two million years ago, with the emergence of Homo erectus (meaning "upright man").
Its predecessor, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as usual.
Two-pedal adaptations are found in Australopithecus fossils dating to between 4.2 and 3.9 million years ago. However, Sahelanthropus may have walked upright, with both legs, much earlier, seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some degree.
This is exactly like symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we do not want to have only a temporary solution, we must find the origin of the problems and end them.
It is obvious enough that the world has changed greatly because of the scientific and technological advances of the human race, and problems have become greater because of man’s overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle.
After adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten sketch signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away to a John Dunlap printer.
During the night around 150 to 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap attacks".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon, in the courtyard of the Independence Hall on July 8.
On July 6, one was sent to George Washington, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap attacks that still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original hand-made copy did not survive.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are alive to this day. We call them birds.
Many people don’t think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are still many similarities between birds and dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs like a T-rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, that is, 0 or 1, and these numbers are classified as binary digits - or bits, using the language used in computing.
The symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The biggest hint of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container with medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions related to that particular poison.
The term "insects" is used by entomologists in a formal sense to treat this group of insects.
This term derives from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects structured enough to stick to humans.
Both barbers and bedbugs are nestlings, adapted to live in nests or shelters of their hosts.
In the United States of America, there are about 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in youth and adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is composed of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their interest, or that of their child.
Such couples are allowed to decide to make a plan to adopt the baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can take care of the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. It is this method that guides scientific research.
It is not, in fact, just experimentation; an experiment is a test used to eliminate one of the possible hypotheses or more, to ask questions. Making observations also guides a scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, the Latin Bible.
All of Aristotle’s scientific thoughts were accepted, including psychology.
As Greek knowledge receded, the West found itself far removed from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Several observed rhythms in physiology and behavior usually depend fundamentally on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are absolutely not responses to external periodic stimuli, have been found for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to operate for a continuous cycle period, even without interference from the environment.
Hershey and Chase’s experiment was one of the main indicators that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase use phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into the bacteria.
They did two experiments that labeled either phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be transmitted to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Natural tourism attracts people interested in visiting areas of nature with the aim of enjoying the landscape, including fauna and flora.
Examples of local activities include fishing, taking photographs, seeing birds, visiting parks and studying about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, by car, people leave the small towns of the countryside, to go to work in other cities, and they come across other people who work precisely in those small towns from which they left.
In this dynamic transport bus, everyone is somehow connected and supporting a transport system based on private cars.
Science points out today that this carbon-based economy has shifted the biosphere from the stable state that had allowed human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone also complains about these transportation systems.
In developed countries, similar levels of complaints about water quality or falling bridges are rarely heard.
Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or something more fundamental is happening?
Traffic flow is the analysis of the movement of drivers and individual vehicles between two different points and the interactions they make with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a relatively consistent range; thus, traffic flows tend to have some reasonable consistency and can be represented mathematically.
To better represent the traffic flow, relationships were established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
Such relationships assist in the planning, design and operations of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to go into the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along the body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot bend their wings back are dragonflies and ephemerals.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite; that the Solar System moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That sounds sensible, because planet Earth doesn't look like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon is the largest river and the second longest on Earth. It carries more than eight times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes almost 10 km wide.
A total of 20% of the water that goes from the planet’s rivers to the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River has 6,387 km (3,980 miles) and receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and in technical construction excellence.
The ancients of New Kingdom Egypt marveled at the constructions of their predecessors, which were so far well over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City has about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its official legislation and communications.
Italian is also the common language used by the majority of those working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Since ancient times, people have known basic chemical elements like gold, silver and copper because they can all be discovered in nature in natural form and are relatively simple to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything is a mixture of one or more of four elements, which are earth, water, air and fire.
This was more related to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are simply a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered to be metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You can also get alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
All things in the universe are made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are so astonishingly small that it would be possible for trillions of them to fit at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it was released.
Unfortunately, as new writing methods appeared, the pencil was relegated to a less important role and use.
Currently, people write messages through computer screens and do not need to get close to a pointer.
We can only imagine what the keyboard will become when something newer comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to build a nucleus with several protons and neutrons.
It's more or less like riding a heavy cart up a hill. The splitting of the core again releases, then, some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to separate with little or no incentive.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is 70 km thick on the visible side and 100 km thick on the invisible side.
The layer is thinner under the seas and thicker under the mountains.
There may be more maria on the nearest side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding out what motivates people or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they reach adulthood.
These theories analyze what is in certain people that makes them want what they do and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular theories of content are Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg’s Two Factor Theory.
Broadly speaking, two behaviors can surface as managers begin to lead their former co-workers. One side of the spectrum tries to stay as "part of the group of guys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, adopting disciplinary measures, making performance evaluations, delegating and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person becomes an unrecognisable individual who feels he must change everything the team has done and do his own thing.
After all, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of a team.
This behavior often ends in conflicts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams have to maintain the same standards of excellence as teams considered conventional, however, there are some subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as the point of contact for your immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams may meet in varied time zones, which may not be understood by local management.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member must report. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the difficult process of establishing organizational learning? One of the practical goals of organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively used by all functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity shine through.
As a result, the process of an organization working as a team to overcome a difficulty can lead to a new innovative process that meets the customer’s need.
Even before an organization is innovative, leaders need to create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) clarifies the Continuum approach as a methodology used to help organizations achieve higher levels in their performance.
Neurobiological data offer physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. Therefore, they narrow the area of research and make it much more accurate.
The correlation between brain and behavioral pathology underpins scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate never-before-seen brain structures and processes.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to design simulation models that help us understand the processes that exist in our mind.
Although AI has a strong science fiction connotation, AI forms a very important branch of computer science by addressing behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
AI research involves producing machines to automate tasks that require intelligent activity.
Examples include control, planning, and scheduling, the ability to address customer issues and diagnoses, as well as recognition of writing, voice, and speech.
These things have become separate disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as it is integrated into various software applications of home computers and video games.
Study visits are very important for any school class. Often, teachers would love to take their students to places where a bus ride is not an option.
Technology offers the solution with virtual field lessons. From the classroom, students can see pieces from museums, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art.
Sharing a field trip virtually is also a great way to reflect on a tour and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, students at North Carolina’s Bennet School develop a website about their trip to the state capital. Every year, the site is remodeled, but old versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students’ writing. Since students often initiate their contact with blogs using poor grammar and spelling, then the presence of an audience usually changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the author of the blog begins to strive to improve writing and avoid criticism.
In addition, having a blog “forces students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them.” The need to fuel public interest inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning far beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can make students more analytical and critical; by interacting with Internet content actively, students can position themselves in the context of the writings of others, as well as define their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada’s charming, bilingual capital and boasts a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada’s past and present.
Niagara Falls is further south; the north has the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and more.
Because of all this and more, Ontario stands out as what outsiders consider the essence of Canada.
Large areas further north are also fairly sparsely populated and some are virtually uninhabited in nature.
As a population comparison that surprises many people: there are more African Americans living in the U.S. than Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean, at a distance from the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent in its own right, when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as luxury beach hotels.
The Arabs also brought to the lands Islam, which gained much popularity in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape Route from Europe to India.
In the north, the region is bounded by the Sahel, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all travelers say they are married, regardless of their current marital status.
It is also useful to use a ring (only not one that seems too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to acts that they would consider harassment, and it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm in refusing men. Don’t be afraid to stand firm (whether it’s cultural differences or not, that doesn’t mean it’s okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name of the White House, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, which was given the name Casablanca by the Spanish merchants who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in Morocco as a whole.
Close to the historic part of Medina it is easy to find traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs and more a lot of trinkets, all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in the far east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried a large part of the city's streets, mainly the center.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside Goma should be studied to understand the state of the battle that persists in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, along with some of Africa’s cheapest mountain gorilla trails.
You can use a boda-boda (mototaxi) to tour Goma. The normal (local) price is around 500 Congolese francs for a quick ride.
"Timbuktu" came to be used as a metaphor to refer to distant and exotic lands in view of their relative inaccessibility.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city despite its reputation making it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was placed on the list of World Heritage in Danger due to the danger of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates' Wonders of the African World, broadcast on PBS.
The city contrasts strongly with the rest of the country because it has a more Arab than African touch.
Kruger National Park is located in northeastern South Africa, along the border of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River on the southern border.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each supporting different animal species.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the standard of the National Parks of South Africa (SANParks).
There are fees for entry and conservation of the park, as with all national parks in South Africa.
It can also be very useful to acquire a Wild Card. With it you can have access to several parks in South Africa or all the South African national parks.
The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists consider as its main attraction.
The parade of buildings that form the skyline of Hong Kong has already been compared to a shimmering bar graph made visible by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, get off the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront on the opposite side.
Most of Hong Kong Island’s urban development is densely concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place the British colonists chose to live, so if you’re looking for evidence of the territory’s colonial past, this is a great place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest range of mangroves in the world, extending 80 km (50 mi) inland towards Bangladesh and India from the coast.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park
But the forests don’t rely on mangrove swamps alone – they have some of the last great jungles that have ever covered the remaining gangetic surface.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, one-third of which is covered by water/swamp areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 deer sighted in the area.
There are several bus departure times from the inter-district bus station (on the other side of the river) during the day, but most, especially those going east and Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
As inter-district buses are almost always crowded, it is advisable to buy the ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by Japanese coastal minibuses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that crosses the Oiapoque River to connect the cities of Oiapoque, Brazil, and S<0xC3><0xA3>o Jorge do Oiapoque, French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long and two runways 3.50 m wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011 and did not open for traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to go into operation in September 2017, the date scheduled for completion of customs inspections in Brazil.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaicurus and Paiaguás, who made their living from hunting, gathering and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called "The Giant Province of the Indies", emerged from the encounter of the Spanish conquistadors with the native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the creation of Asunci<0xC3><0xB3>n in 1537, Paraguay has succeeded in maintaining many of its indigenous characteristics and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields in Las Ca<0xC3><0xB1>itas.
Tournaments and smaller matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, consult the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), whose value is equivalent to one British pound (GBP).
The money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands that is located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
The pound sterling is generally accepted anywhere on the islands and credit cards and US dollars are accepted in Stanley.
In remote islands, it is unlikely that credit cards will be accepted, although British and American currencies may be received. Please inquire with the owners in advance to find out what payment method they accept.
It’s virtually impossible to change the Falklands’ currency outside the islands, so change the money before you leave the islands.
As Montevideo lies south of the equator, there is summer, while it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical region; in the summer months, temperatures above 30 °C are common.
Winter can be disappointingly cold: temperatures rarely stay below freezing, but the combined wind and humidity make the feeling colder than what the thermometer shows.
There are no particularly "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain remains basically the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to the presence of humans, they are still wild animals that should not be fed or disturbed.
Following the instructions of the park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/metres from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/metres from all other wildlife!
Despite their docile appearance, bison, moose and bears, as well as all large animals, can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they did not maintain an adequate distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so do not approach.
What’s more, know that odors attract bears and other wildlife, however, avoid carrying or cooking strong-smelling foods and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of a well-known naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the U.S. and Britain refused to leave it.
All the ships were sunk, except for one cruiser from Great Britain, nearly 200 lives of Germans and Americans perished.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city resulted in the assassination of supreme chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, due to Auckland being between two coves. The most popular ones are in three areas.
The beaches on the north coast (in the North Harbour district) are bathed by the Pacific Ocean and run from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches with safe swimming, and many have shadows coming from the pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located in Waitemata Harbour, in the sophisticated suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a wide variety of shops around the coast. Swimming is quite safe.
The main local beer is 'Number One'. It is not an elaborate beer, but it is pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called 'Manta'.
There are plenty of French wines to enjoy, but New Zealand and Australian wines may go down better.
The local tap water is totally safe for consumption, but it’s easy to find bottled water if you’re afraid.
For Australians, the concept of "flat white" coffee is strange. A short black coffee is "espresso", cappuccino comes full of cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate conforms to Belgian standards. Natural juices are expensive, but great.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries from any of these causes, occurring on the reef, are rare.
Continue to heed the authorities’ reminders, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety alerts.
The Cubomedusa occurs near beaches and river estuaries from October to April north of 1770. They can occasionally be found in other periods.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most are afraid of humans and tend to swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean. Their main habitat is the estuaries of the rivers that lie north of Rockhampton.
Early booking gives the traveler the peace of mind that they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often do business with specific hotels, although it is likely possible to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, by a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or even packages combined with flights and hotels.
They can also guarantee your reservation if you need time to think about the offer or gather other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, if you have any changes or requests, they should first be directed to the travel agent, and not directly to the hotel.
In some festivals, the vast majority of music festival participants decide to camp on site, and most of them consider this a key part of the experience.
If you want to get close to the action, you'll have to get there early to be able to camp near the music.
Remember that even after the music closes on the main stages, some sections of the festival may continue to play late.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the northern Baltic in winter, check the location of the cabin, because crossing the ice generates a terrible noise for the most sensitive.
Cruises in St. Petersburg include city tours. Passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see terms).
Casinos usually make a lot of efforts to maximize the time and money spent by their visitors. In general there are no windows or clocks, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have special food, drink and entertainment offers to keep guests in a good mood and to keep them on site.
Some places offer alcoholic beverages on behalf of the house. However, drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good bettors know the importance of maintaining sobriety.
Whenever someone is driving in places with high latitudes or on roads over the mountains, they should take into consideration the possibility of facing snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
On roads with ice and snow, the friction is low, and you can’t drive like you’re on clean asphalt.
During blizzards, it is possible to fall enough snow to leave you trapped in very little time.
Visibility may also be reduced by falling or windy snow, or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic remains almost uninterrupted throughout the year.
The safaris are probably Africa’s biggest tourist attraction and eye-catcher for many visitors.
The term "safari", in its colloquial use, refers to overland journeys to observe the stunning African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, have a tendency to approach cars and basic equipment allows for good viewing.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you’ll see them better with binoculars.
Also known as “forest walking,” “walking safari,” or “passing,” a walking safari is equivalent to walking, whether for a few hours or many days.
The Paralympics will take place between August 24 and September 5, 2021. Some events will be hosted in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you have scheduled your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement is announced, you may have a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but in late March most cancellation policies because of the coronavirus did not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Most tickets to the events are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with normal tickets costing around 7,000 yen.
Ironing wet clothes can help dry out. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards on loan, even if there isn’t one in the room.
If an iron is not available, or if you do not like to wear socks, you can try using a hair dryer if available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which can cause it to shrink or, in more severe cases, cause burns).
There are different ways to purify water, some more efficient against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling the water for a minute is enough; in others, many minutes are needed.
The quality of the filters varies, and if you’re in doubt, you might want to consider buying gallons of water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests with which they are not familiar in the regions from which they came.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, at worst, cause allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can hurt or kill people through force, usually do not qualify as pests.
Duty free shopping is the chance to buy duty-free goods in certain locations.
Travelers who visit countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging conditions for drivers on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, who often pass through secluded backcountry areas.
If you’re not used to driving on inland roads, beware: steep slopes, narrow tracks, and sharp bends are common.
The announced speed limits are noticeably lower than in the previous and subsequent sections – commonly 55-65 km/h – and strict obedience to them is even more important than the opposite.
Interestingly, however, cell phone service is much stronger here than along many other stretches of the route, such as in Pennsylvania Wilds.
German sweets are very good and, in Bavaria, they are very capricious and varied, similar to those of the southern neighbor, Austria.
Sweets with fruits are recurrent, with baked apples in the pastries all year round, and cherries and plums marking presence during the summer.
Many goods from German bakeries also have almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. The famous cakes usually combine very well with a very strong cup of coffee.
If you want some small but tasty sweets, try what, depending on the region, can be called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, together with meat or vegetables.
A curry can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.

With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a range that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
But, if used without other qualifiers, the term tends to mean that the food originally came from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available across the archipelago, Javanese cuisine includes a variety of dishes seasoned in a simple way, the predominant condiments preferably Javanese being peanuts, peppers, sugar (mainly Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
In order for the feet of a rider to have support, stirrups are used, which are hung on both sides of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but can present safety issues as the rider’s feet can get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse, but has one of his feet caught in the stirrup, he can be dragged if the animal ends up running away. To reduce this danger, several safety precautions can be taken
First, a large part of the riders wear riding boots with a flat heel and sole, which is quite narrow.
Then some saddles, mainly English saddles, have safety bars that allow a leather stirrup to fall from the saddle if pulled back by a falling rider.
Being Chile’s main climbing destination, the Cocham<0xC3><0xB3> Valley is known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large granite cliffs and cliffs.
Meetings include exciting views of the peaks. Mountaineers from all parts of the world are continually establishing new routes among their infinite potential of cliffs.
Snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding across snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard fixed to the feet.
Skiing is an important activity on the trip for many enthusiasts, occasionally known as "ski booms", who plan entire vacations just to ski in a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old—rock paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 B.C.!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in the year 1861, the first recreational skiing team was opened by citizens of Norway in Australia.
Ski backpacking: also known as backcountry skiing, touring skiing or ski mountaineering.
It is related, but usually does not involve alpine skiing or mountaineering, the latter made on steep terrain and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski route as a walking route.
In good conditions, you’ll be able to cover slightly greater distances than on foot — but only very rarely will you achieve the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on prepared slopes.
Europe is a relatively small continent but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean having to go through visa applications and passport control several times.
The Schengen area, however, functions as a country in this respect.
If you stay in this area, it is possible to cross the border without going through passport checkpoints again.
Similarly, by holding a Schengen visa, you will not need to apply for visas for each of the Schengen member countries separately, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition specifying which manufactured items are antiques. Some tax agencies define items over 100 years old to be antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit may be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Artisanal products can be defined as antiques, although they are younger than mass-produced similar products.
Reindeer breeding is an important means of livelihood among the Sámi, and the culture surrounding the trade is also important for many other classes of professionals.
As much as it is a tradition, not all the Sami have participated in the creation of reindeer on a large scale, but they have lived from fishing, hunting and the like, having the reindeer as mainly animals of traction.
Today, many Sámi work with modern businesses. Tourism is an important income in Sápmi, the Sámi area.

Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of bad weather in their region as this can affect travel plans.
When planning a visit to a country that is considered a war zone, the person must first receive professional training.
An Internet search for 'Hostile environment course' will usually indicate the address of a company in the region.
A course will typically cover all the topics discussed here in much more detail, usually with hands-on experience.
A course usually lasts between 2 and 5 days and involves dramatization, several first aid and sometimes training with the use of weapons.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in the jungle are common, but publications about war zones are rare.
Travelers planning a sex reassignment surgery abroad should ensure that they are carrying valid documents for the return trip.
The willingness of governments to issue gender-undefined (X) passports, or updated documents to find a desired name and gender, varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents is widely variable.
Searches at security checkpoints also became much more intrusive after September 11, 2001.
Transgender people who have not yet had gender reassignment surgery should not expect to go through the scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Return currents are the ebb of wave water on the beach returning to the sea, usually in a reef or similar area.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow becomes concentrated in some deeper sections, and a rapid current can form for deep water there.
Most deaths are the result of fatigue from trying to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you get out of the current, swimming back in is no harder than it usually would be.
Try to aim from somewhere where you can't be caught or, depending on your abilities or if you've been detected, wait for rescue.
Re-entry shock occurs earlier than culture shock (less honeymoon time occurs), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travellers who have adapted easily to the new culture sometimes have a special difficulty re-adjusting to their native culture.
By returning home after living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some of the habits of your local culture.
When you first went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
People do not imagine that patience and understanding are also fundamental for travelers who are returning home.
In the area reserved for children, one of the most interesting things is the show of lights and sounds of the pyramid.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and also in the silence before the show starts.
Usually you always hear the sound of tourists and vendors. The history of sound and light is like a book of stories.
The Sphinx is defined as the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are displayed in the pyramids and different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, which had their discovery in the year 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the largest number of bases, with sixteen active until the year 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, where the village of Villa Las Estrellas is located.
The others are Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the southern region of the peninsula, coastal to the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the Peninsula here merge into the plateau, then reemerge to form the 360 km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, cut by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Range, has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, reaching 4,892m on Mount Vinson.
In remote locations, without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone usually does not replace a mobile phone, since to make a call you need to be outdoors with a view of the satellite.
The service is often used for transportation, including recreational vessels, as well as expeditions that have remote voice and data needs.
Your local carrier may offer more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those who plan to take a gap year is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular among school leavers, allowing them to take a year off from college without compromising their education.
In most cases, enrolling in a course abroad during a gap year can actually increase your chances of entering higher education in your home country.
Normally, there will be a tuition fee to enroll in these educational programs.
For those who like boating, Finland is a great destination. In the lakes and coastal archipelagos, the "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands.
In the archipelagos and lakes, you do not necessarily need a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are actually large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a differentiated experience.
Sailing with a boat is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is combined by Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but a fairly characteristic form (for example, in the Netherlands, the number is from one to forty).
Most Baltic cruises offer extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for two full days and return to the ship to sleep at night.
If you only embark on sea excursions, you will not need a separate visa (valid from 2009).
Some cruises show Berlin, Germany, on the flyers. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not close to the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by plane can be a scary experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if these people have not traveled by plane before or if they have never experienced a traumatic event.
It’s not something to be ashamed of: it’s no different from personal fears and dislikes for other things that many people have.
For some, understanding something about how aircraft work and what happens during a flight can help them overcome fear that is based on the unknown or not being in control.
Shipping companies are well paid to deliver things quickly. Often, time is very important in sending commercial documents, goods or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, larger companies have their own planes, but for other smaller routes and companies, there was a problem.
If they sent things by air freight, depending on the route, it may take days to arrive at the landing and go through customs.
The only way to get through faster was to ship as checked baggage. Airline regulations do not allow them to ship baggage without a passenger, which is where you enter.
The obvious way to fly first class or business class is to shell out a large amount of money for the privilege (or, better yet, get your company to do it for you).
However, it is not cheap: as basic rules, you can expect to pay up to four times more than the normal economy fare for business class and eleven times more for first class!
In general terms, it is not even worth looking for discounts on seats for business class or first class on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that there is a small group of passengers who are willing to pay a high price for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The language of the country is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Economic relations were re-established between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure in political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.

Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a modern, developed and bustling shopping centre, located around a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide avenues, glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping malls are marked by traditional red roofs, the 18th-century market, and the old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere that refers more to Mediterranean Europe than to classical Turkey.
The village of Haldarsv<0xC3><0xAD>k offers views of the neighbouring island Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.

Please treat the place with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not damage the place by staining or cracking the buildings with graffiti.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Almost half of people prefer to speak Catalan, most understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish
However, most of the plates are only in Catalan, because this is the language that was established by law as an official language.

Regular announcements on the metro are made only in Catalan, but unplanned interruptions are announced by an automated system in a wide variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.

The brusque Parisian exterior will quickly disappear, if you show some basic courtesy
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is highly wooded, mostly with beech, fir, and pine trees, and features a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
There is a remarkable diversity of plant communities due to the varied microclimates, different soils and different levels of altitude.

Rare animals can be found there, such as European grizzly bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynxes, feral cats and tetraces, as well as several other common species.
While visiting the monasteries, women are required to wear skirts covering their knees and also need to have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries provide costumes for women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own costumes, especially with bright colors, you will be greeted with a smile from the monk or nun.
Similarly, men are required to wear pants covering their knees.
It is possible to borrow clothes at the entrance; however, they are not washed after each use, so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. For men, there is a unique size!
Mallorcan cuisine, as well as that of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil in everything.

All nouns, along with the word Sie for you, always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
This also makes reading easier, no doubt, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to find out if a verb or adjective is used substantively.
The pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, as most words are pronounced exactly as they were written.

Pre-modern observatories are mostly outdated today and remain in museums or schools.
As light pollution in their golden age was not a problem, they usually meet in cities or university campuses, easier to reach than those built more recently.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas that exhibit favorable atmospheric conditions.
The observation of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where plum blossoms were the preferred flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were held by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the Imperial Court.

All the animals that originally came to the islands came here swimming, flying or floating.
Due to the long distance from the mainland, mammals could not make the journey, which made the giant tortoise the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you are visiting the Arctic or Antarctic areas in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a great opportunity to see the aurora borealis, as the sky gets dark at about the right time.
As the areas are sparsely inhabited, and consequently light pollution is not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
