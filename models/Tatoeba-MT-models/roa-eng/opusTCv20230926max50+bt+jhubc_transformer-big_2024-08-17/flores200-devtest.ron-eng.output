In the PALM study, ZMapp served as a benchmark, meaning that the scientists used it as a basis and compared the other three treatments with it.
USA Gymnastics supports the letter of the US Olympic Committee and accepts the absolute need of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, and the sport they play, can be better served by implementing significant changes in our organization than by withdrawing certification.
USA Gymnastics supports the conduct of an independent investigation, which can shed light on how abuses of the proportions so courageously described by those abused by Larry Nassar could have gone unnoticed for so long, and accept any necessary and appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and USOC have the same goal – to make sports gymnastics, as well as other sports, as safe as possible for athletes to follow their dream in a safe environment with a positive and permissive atmosphere.

This not only confirms that at least some of the dinosaurs were covered with feathers, an already widespread hypothesis, but provides details that generally cannot be obtained from fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was brownish-brown in the upper part, with a light color or orange in the lower part.
The discovery also provides insight into how bird feathers evolved.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed axis, called a rachis, but have other characteristic elements of feathers – beards and barbels – the researchers concluded that the rachis was probably an evolutionary development that arose after the other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight, but rather for temperature regulation or for impressionation. Researchers have suggested that even if this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows an adult plumage and not chicken fluff.
The researchers suggested that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows an adult plumage and not the puff of a chicken.
A car bomb that exploded yesterday morning at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killed two police officers and injured more than 20 people.

They found that the Sun operates on the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all the stars in the system has been shown to be driven by their brightness, their rotation, and nothing else.
Luminosity and rotation are used in combination to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to plasma flux.
The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star will be in terms of magnetic inversions.

The work submitted was largely theoretical, but the program was designed to stimulate observation of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would have been caused by tidal forces produced between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts an attraction on the Earth, causing tides, so the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter does.
This theory says that dark matter in a galaxy is located around the galaxy as a kind of aura and is composed of a lot of small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the presence of highly drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview, he said the new version is “very disturbing and worrying because of the very high mortality rate.”
Some patients may have contracted the virus in the hospital, Dr. Moll says, and at least two were hospital staff.
During a year, an infected person can infect between 10 and 15 people with whom they are in close contact.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire group of people with tuberculosis appears to be still low; 6,000 of the total 330,000 people infected at any one time in South Africa.

Infrared images show that the temperature differences between night and day indicate the probability that they are caves.
“They are colder than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
Their thermal behavior is not as stable as that of large caves on Earth, which generally maintain a constant temperature, but is consistent with the hypothesis that they would represent deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushind of the Astrogeological Team of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and the University of Northern Arizona in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a bit of a technical experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and insert a pre-printed sheet of paper in an envelope that indicates which candidate they have chosen.
After officials verify the voter's identity, he leaves the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting list.
French electoral law rather strictly codifies the procedures to be followed.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent, so that voters and observers confirm that there are no envelopes at the beginning of the vote and that no envelopes are added, except for those of duly numbered and authorised voters.
Candidates can send their representatives to be witnesses at all stages of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, with respect to clear procedures.

In the other race in which she participated, the giant slalom finished tenth in the group sitting female, with a total time of 4:41.30, with 2:11.60 minutes after the first arrival, Australian Claudia Loesch, and with 1:09.02 minutes behind the competitor in the ninth place, Gy<0xC3><0xB6>ngyi Dani from Hungary.
Four skiers from the women’s event in a seated position failed to finish their lap, and 45 of the 117 skiers from the giant slalom failed to get a place in the competition.
Police in Madhya Pradesh recovered the laptop and mobile phone that had been stolen.
Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya said: “We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop.”
The defendants are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the defendants appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car hit her, no one was injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road that had the accident was temporarily closed until emergency services extracted the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later, he was transferred to Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with the murder of her son at the Sheriff's Court in Edinburgh.
She was detained pending indictment and trial, but any eyewitness testimony could be altered as her image was widely publicized.
This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but the Scottish justice system works differently, and the courts have decided that posting the photos can be harmful.
“Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee observes that ‘journalists seem to play with fire by publishing photographs and other information about suspects.’
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is tasked with prosecuting the case, told reporters it would not comment further until at least the indictment.
According to the leak, the document will refer to the dispute over borders, which Palestine wants drawn on the basis of pre-war borders in the Middle East in 1967.
Other themes addressed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is a sacred place for both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands that, after signing the agreement, it have a continuous military presence in the valley for a period of ten years, while the PA agrees to accept this presence only for a period of five years.
Hunters who took part in the additional pest control test were to be closely monitored by rangers, with the test being monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Australian Sport Hunters Association (NSW), qualified volunteers were recruited, based on the Sport Hunters Association’s hunting program.
According to Mick O’Flynn, Executive Director for Park Conservation and Heritage at NPWS, the four hunters selected for the first hunting operation have received comprehensive safety training and training.
Martelly took the oath before a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP), composed of nine members.
This is Martelly’s fifth post-mortem in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a package of measures to steer the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly’s response to widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which should have taken place as early as 2011.
About 60 cases of malfunctioning iPod overheating have been reported, causing a total of six fires and causing minor burns in four people.
Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (MECI) said it was aware of 27 device-related accidents.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 more overheating incidents, which the company said were “not serious.”
The ministry responded, saying Apple’s delay was “truly regrettable.”
The earthquake struck the Marianas at 07:19 local time (Friday at 21:19 GMT).
The Northern Marianas Emergency Management Office said no damage had been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer has taken hostage tourists from Hong Kong, hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the state of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued and so far at least six have been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier, along with Filipino photographs.
Later, photographs took the place of an elderly woman who needed a toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
She studied obstetrics and in 1959 began working for the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching premature labor in his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was administered, it would accelerate the lung maturation of the fetus.
Xinhua said government investigators recovered two “black box” flight recorders on Wednesday.
The fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to the Moon.
<0xE2><0x80><0x9E>Tommy Dreamer said that <0xC2><0xAB>Luna was the first Queen of Extremes. My first manager. Luna died in the night with two months. A unique moment, as she was. A strong woman.<0xC2><0xBB>.
Dustin Runnels, nicknamed “Golden Dust,” commented that “The moon was as eccentric as I was... maybe even more... I love it and I’ll miss it... I hope it’s in a better place.”
Out of 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, the number of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% compared to 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard argued during the 2010 federal election campaign that, in her opinion, Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II comes to an end.
34% of those surveyed agree with this view, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extremes of the poll, 29% of those polled believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to swim at the Commonwealth Games, in the 100 m and 200 m freestyle events, as well as three relay events, but his physical condition was called into question due to his complaints.
He was unable to take the necessary medicines to control the pain, which were banned during the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date.
Several people checked the discovery before the beginning of February, using different combinations of hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the earth's water supply, along with organic matter, which can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, because comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his rule earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as representing "political chatter and nonsense".
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says would allow aircraft to fly shorter distances, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses technology that relies on the use of satellites, unlike older systems based on ground radar, to allow air traffic controllers to more accurately locate aircraft and transmit more accurate information to pilots.
No additional means of transport are available, surface trains do not stop at Wembley, and public transport-related parking and facilities are not available in the area.
Fears about the lack of means of transport brought into question the possibility of organizing the game behind closed doors, in the absence of team supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported on the development of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that this process would take much longer, due to breeding between endemic Darwin’s finches, Geospiza fortes, and an immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked in a multitude of patterns. It can be rolled into tiny objects.
It can be pulled into thin wires that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or sheet-shaped laminate.
It can be made very thin and glued onto another metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical. An indicator can be prepared using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons whose electrons have been removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two powders together, and then, with clean and wet hands, form a ball out of them.
The moisture present on the hands will react with the outer layers, which can give you a strange feeling and lead to the formation of a kind of crust.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets in almost every house, attached to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems were found in homes in the mining towns of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets were also found in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In the Romans, toilets were sometimes found as part of public baths, which men and women used in common.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're doing it through a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back, almost instantly.
Scientists use telescopes in space, because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
It takes a huge, 100-foot-tall rocket to carry a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The most important thing the wheel has given us has been to give us a much simpler and faster transport.
He brought us the train, the car and many other means of transport.
Below them we have several medium-sized felines, which feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (including free-ranging pet cats) that eat far more numerous small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The key to their success is the concept of the niche; each feline has its own role to fulfill, so it is not in competition with others.
Lions are the most social felines, living in large groups called packs.
Families consist of one to three adult male relatives, along with up to thirty females and offspring.
Females are usually related to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion families behave very similar to packs of wolves or dogs, animals with surprising behavior similar to lions (but not other large felines), and also very lethal to their prey.
A complete athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump long distances, and shoot with a force five times that of a strong man.
Tigers fall into the same group (genus Panthera) with lions, leopards and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the roar of a lion’s full voice, but rather a sentence of sharp, shouted words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they can, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents or birds. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than this.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) with the help of smell, sniffing the ground to find them.
Thanks to the night vision, they can see very well in the dark and can move undetected. Ocelots hunt their prey by camouflaged in the environment in which they are, then throwing themselves on the prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) becomes isolated from the main population they come from (for example, if they move over a mountain range or river or move to a new island, from which they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than they needed before.
The original population has not changed at all, it needs the same adaptations as before.
With the passage of time, as the new population adapts to the environment, its members begin to look less and less similar to the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different from each other that we will no longer be able to say that they are the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is a consequence that cannot be avoided and is a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which people breathe in, and absorb carbon dioxide, which people exhale (i.e. expel from the lungs).
Plants produce their food with the help of the sun, through photosynthesis.
We make our houses from plants and we make our clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The Mosasaur was the top predator of its time, having no fear of anything except other mosasaurs.
His long jaws had over 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the roof of his mouth, which means that nothing that came his way escaped.
Its food included turtles, large fish, other species of mosasaurians, and it may even have been cannibalistic.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; not even a giant dinosaur like T-Rex could stand up to it.
While most of their cuisine would be familiar to us, the Romans also had strange or unusual festive dishes, which included boars, peacocks, snails, and a rodent called a fart.
Another difference was that, while poor men and women ate while sitting on the chair, rich men liked to make banquets in which they lay on their side while eating.
The cuisine of ancient Rome could not include foods that arrived in Europe, America, or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered to be the home of that god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to meet the gods’ needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an internal sanctuary into which only priests could enter.
Sometimes, as part of the temples, pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were also built.
The top of the tower was the sanctuary dedicated to the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was less important.
Most of the life of a Jewish family was spent in the open air.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were just the counters that led to the street.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, so wood was very expensive.
In the Scandinavian saga it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and while traveling further west, he found Green Land and named it Greenland.
But no matter what discoveries he made, tribes of Eskimos were already living in those places at that time.
Although they were all "Scandinavian" countries, there were many differences in population, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you watched the movie National Treasure, you might think that a map of the treasure was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a map of a treasure.
"On the back of the Declaration of Independence can be read the words: 'Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776.' The text appears upside down, at the bottom of the document."
Although it is not known with certainty who wrote it, it is nevertheless known that, in its beginnings, the large parchment document (measures 293<0xE2><0x81><0x84>4 inches by 241<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 inches) had been kept rolled.
So, the marking was probably done simply for labeling.
The D-Day landings and ensuing fighting liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
"It was led by the Vichy French, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and were working alongside the invaders instead of fighting them."
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, calling the invasion "Operation Dragoon."
Within two weeks, American forces along with the Free French had liberated southern France and were heading for Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a significant group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, being related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state; it also defines in a way the size of society.
State cities are the forerunners of nations. A civilizational culture involves the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a persistent cultural imprint and reasonable spread.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as full-fledged civilizations.
During the Revolution, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government—the Congress being its only component—under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes and, because there was no executive or judicial authority at the national level, relied on state authorities, often uncooperative, to implement its decisions.
It also did not have the authority to overturn laws and tax rates between states.
The Articles required unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended, and states treated the central government so easily that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football team, along with the German national football team, ranks second among the most successful teams in the world and were the champions of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians taking part in international competitions and Olympic events.
There are nearly 7,000 islands in Japan (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the island groups Japan has, it is often said that Japan is geographically an "archipelago."
The beginning of Taiwan came a long time ago, in the 15th century, when European sailors passing by the island, recorded the name as Ilha Formosa or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, starting a transformation in Aboriginal grain production practices and hiring Chinese workers to work on the sugar and rice plantations.
In 1683, Qing forces (1644–1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1985, after the defeat of the First Sino-Japanese War (1984–1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been rebuilt to allow tourists to form a better idea of their original appearance.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common static photo format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its proportions have been taken over by the digital camera’s image sensor formats.
The somewhat confusing 35mm format is actually 36mm in width over 24mm in height.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore stated to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., the APS family of formats) are identical to or very close to this ratio.
The rule of thirds, much abused and often ridiculed, is nothing more than a simple suggestion to create dynamism, while maintaining some order in an image.
According to it, the best place for positioning the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the frame in thirds vertically and horizontally (see the example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, drew attention to him.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has bound European states to each other, despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power affected everyone from the king to the ordinary mortal.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church monetary funds exist specifically for this reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money caused many to question whether the principle was indeed respected.
Shortly after hostilities began, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off the supply of vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted provisions of international law, enshrined in several international agreements signed over the past two centuries.
Britain has mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire ocean areas, endangering even neutral ships.
The answer to this tactic being reserved, Germany expected a similar reaction in the case of its unbridled submarine war.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were one of pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the U.S. with only four cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss from his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of delineating different time periods; each stage of China or each family that held power represented a distinct dynasty.
The best-known interval of this kind was the Three Kingdoms Period, which spanned 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods there were fierce wars between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of ancient China, with thousands of people dying fighting to take the throne from the great palace in Xi'an.
It had many social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from an absolutist to a republican, nationalist system, and the belief that the country belonged to the people, not to a single ruler.
Also, after the Revolution, men were able to enter all occupations, allowing the most ambitious and talented to have success.
The same goes for the military, because instead of the class-based military hierarchy, they were now calibre-based.
The French Revolution, in turn, inspired many other oppressed workers in other countries to start their own revolutions.
He used to go often to meditate in a cave that came to be known as "Hira", located on Mount "Noor" (light).
The cave itself, which has survived through time, allows us to form a vivid picture of Muhammad’s spiritual inclinations.
Located at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is difficult to find even when you know its existence. Once inside the cave, you are completely isolated.
The only things that can be seen are the clear and beautiful sky above and the surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be glimpsed or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the world that has remained standing to this day.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built in honor of a dead pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, also called the Giza Necropolis, in the Valley of the Dead, Egypt, houses several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the tallest), several smaller tombs, a number of temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
“The ‘feature up’ mark looks like a V, and the ‘feature down’ mark looks like a staple or a square that lacks the bottom side.”
Up means that you have to start at the top and push the bow; down means that you have to start at the frog (i.e. the part where you grab the bow by hand) and pull the bow.
An upward arch feature usually generates a softer sound, while a downward feature is stronger and more determined.
Do not hesitate to mark your own indications, but remember that the printed indications for the features of the bow are there for musical reasons and should normally be respected.
On 6 October 1789, the frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (Marie Thér<0xC3><0xA8>se aged 11 and Louis-Charles aged four) and the King's sister, Madame <0xC3><0x89>lisabeth, were forced by a mob of merchants to return from Versailles to Paris.
They drove back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd shouting and shouting threats at the king and queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to leave the windows of the carriage wide open.
At one point, someone in the crowd raised the head of a member of the royal guard, killed at Versailles in front of the frightened queen’s eyes.
The war expenses of U.S. imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime in order to bear a large part of the expenses and interest related to the bonds placed in the name of the Philippine government through the banks on Wall Street.
Of course, the enormous profits from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people were the basic gain of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, we need to understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The period in which the events took place is usually called the High Middle Ages, representing the era in European history that spans the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 CE).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological pressure or technological imperative, to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by a related logic, associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological development itself follows a path largely outside of cultural and political influence, and that technology, in turn, has “effects” on society that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it could be said that the car necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce car ownership costs.
A large number of car owners leads to an increased incidence of accidents on public roads, which leads to the invention of new medical techniques for the healing of personal injuries.
An important component of Romanticism was cultural determinism, borrowed from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals and, over time, customs and cultures related to that geography appeared, and these, being in harmony with the place occupied by society, were better than the laws imposed arbitrarily.
As Paris is considered the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as a center of luxury began to spread around 400 C.E. and lasted until around 1100 C.E.
Its status declined during the 12th century, mainly because the Crusaders returned loaded with gifts such as silk and spices more prized than what the Byzantine markets offered.
This was the time when the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
At first, clothing was heavily influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, due to slow communication channels, western styles can be 25 to 30 years old.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most important advances of that period was that, following the Crusades, people began to use buttons to close their clothing.
Subsistence farming is farming done to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often ecological system that uses preserved seeds from the same ecological region, along with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence farming and this is still happening in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel set aside by societal standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinct due to age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through a distinct and symbolic use of characteristic style, which includes fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to be inspired in a few unfortunate cases by children who, as a result of neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse, have not been socialized by adults while they were growing up.
“Such children are called ‘untamed’ or wild. Some wild children were abducted by humans (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of the child was due to rejection by the parents, due to severe intellectual or physical deficiencies.”
Savage children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or ran away from home.
Some are believed to have been raised by animals; others are said to have lived alone in the wild.
The wild child, when raised entirely by non-human animals, exhibits behaviors (within its physical limits) almost entirely like those of the animal that cared for it, such as fear or indifference to humans.
Although project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a little further.
The scaffolding or construction site method is not a learning method, but rather an aid that provides support to people going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Skeletons can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the little staple man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual Schemas are included in the software, having the role of interrogating, providing clues and explaining procedures that might otherwise be too complicated for the student to handle on their own.
Children are placed in family care for numerous reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse, even going as far as extortion.
There should not be children growing up in an environment where they are deprived of food, love and education, but there is.
We perceive the family care system as a safe area for these children.
Our family care system must provide safe accommodation, caring caregivers, sound education and reliable healthcare.
Family care is supposed to cover the needs of the children, who were not covered in the house where they had previously been.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
Distinctive features of the other Internet introduce additional dimensions in terms of addressing types of uses and satisfaction.
For example, “learning” and “socialization” are suggested as important motivations for internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated public reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro expressions, facial movements that last several milliseconds.
In particular, it is argued that it is possible to observe whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting facial microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his “President’s Speech,” showed how people who can’t understand speech due to brain damage still manage to accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior can be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two groups of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutations add new genetic variations, and selection removes them from the set of expressed variations.
Separation and recombination mean that in each generation the direction of variation is dominated by one or the other of the two genetic funds.
In the savannah, a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans finds it difficult to satisfy its amino acid requirements from available plant resources.
In addition, failure to do so has serious consequences: stunting, malnutrition and, ultimately, death.
The most readily available plant resources were leaf proteins and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest if not cooked.
In contrast, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest, but also provides large amounts of protein that contains all the essential amino acids.
“Given all this, it shouldn’t surprise us if our ancestors solved the ‘protein problem’ in a similar way to chimpanzees in modern-day savannahs.”
Sleep disruption is the procedure by which you intentionally wake up during your normal sleep period to fall back to sleep after a short time (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily done using a relatively quiet alarm clock, to bring you into a conscious state without fully waking up.
If you happen to reset your alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, forcing yourself to get out of bed to stop it.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking fluids (especially water or tea, which has diuretic effects) before bedtime, forcing us to get out of bed to urinate.
The inner peace a person feels is inversely proportional to the tension in one’s body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force. Everyone has the opportunity to find absolute peace and contentment.
The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is your own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, to which were added the Mahayana path of love and many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
In Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The central aspect of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. By visualizing the various deities, the energy channels are cleared, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to a collaboration between the USSR and the US. With the end of the war, system, process and culture clashes led to the distance of the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War was beginning.
It was to last forty years and will be fought seriously, by “delegated” armies, on battlefields spread from Africa to Asia, to Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defence had already collapsed, and the only hope was a retreat and reorganisation along the Romanian bridgehead.
The plans became futile almost overnight, however, when over 800,000 Red Army soldiers of the Soviet Union were set in motion creating the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after they invaded eastern Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to transport both goods and people across the oceans.
Traditionally, the role of the navy has been to ensure a country’s ability to move people and goods, while interfering with the enemy’s ability to transport people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic Campaign of World War II. The Americans were trying to transport people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using submarines in particular, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have succeeded in occupying Britain, as it did the rest of Europe.
The goats appear to have been tamed for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them close to home in order to have easy access to milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other pastures, usually in the care of deer that were often children or adolescents, similar to the well-known sheepfolds of the past.
Wagonway roads have been built in England since the 16th century.
Although these wagonways consisted only of wooden planks laid out in parallel, they allowed the horses to reach higher speeds and pull heavier loads than they could on the slightly more irregular roads of the time.
The crossbars were introduced quite early, to keep the rails in place. However, gradually, it was concluded that the rails would be more effective if they had a metal strip on top.
This became a widespread practice, but iron led to the faster wear of wooden wagon wheels.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron were produced.
The first known means of transport was walking; humans began walking upright 2 million years ago, with the appearance of Homo erectus (meaning the right man).
Their predecessor, Australopithecus, did not usually walk upright.
Bipedal specialization is found in 4.2-3.9 million-year-old Australopithecus fossils, although Sahelanthropus may have already been bipedal seven million years ago.
We can start living in an environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is the same as symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we do not want only a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problems and we should turn them off.
It is obvious that the world has changed a lot as a result of scientific and technological advances, and the problems are greater now because of overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humanity.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft, signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was then sent to John Dunlap's printing press, a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 children were made, known as Dunlap posters.
On July 8, the first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon at Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap posters still in existence are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript no longer exists.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today. We call them birds.
Many people do not think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But in birds you can still see many dinosaur-like features.
They have legs with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on their two back legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can contain only one of the two values, respectively 0 or 1, and the name of these numbers is binary digits or bits, in computer jargon.
Symptoms, such as vomiting, are general enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication for internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of drugs or toxic household chemicals.
See the label for first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term "bug" is used by entomologists specifically for this group of insects.
The term originates from the ancient resemblance to bedbugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both killer cockroaches and bedbugs are nesting, adapted to life in the nest or the home of their host.
In the United States, there are nearly 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), meaning that it is the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may come to the conclusion that raising a child is neither in their interest nor that of the child.
These couples may choose to formulate an adoption plan for their child.
In the case of an adoption, the natural parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can become the parents of the child.
The main purpose of science is to figure out how the world works, using the scientific method. This method is applied in most scientific research.
It is not the only one however, experimentation and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, asking questions and making observations also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers have used classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's ideas on all aspects of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of the Greek language declined, the West woke up separated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Cyclic rhythms, which are not simply responses to periodic external stimuli, have been observed in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to operate for a period of time, even in the absence of external stimuli.
Hershey and Chase’s experiment represented one of the most important pieces of evidence in favor of the DNA is genetic material hypothesis.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, a type of virus, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments marking either the bacteriophage's DNA with radioactive phosphorus or its proteins with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a number of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germ cells or not.
Only mutations in germline-like cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Tourism organized around nature exploration attracts people interested in visiting natural environments to enjoy the landscape, including wild animals and vegetation.
Examples of field activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, as well as visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example would be visiting, photographing and learning more about the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people drive from small settlements in the country to their workplaces, passing by others whose work destination is the place they just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a transport system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this massively carbon-based economy has displaced the biosphere from one of its stable states, which has underpinned human evolution for the past 2 million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, similar levels of dissatisfaction with water quality or the collapse of bridges are rarely encountered.
Why do transport systems give rise to such discontents, why do they fail every day? Is it because transport engineers are simply incompetent? Or is something more serious happening?
Traffic flow studies the movement of drivers and individual vehicles between two points and how they interact with each other.
The study of traffic flow is unfortunately difficult, because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with absolute accuracy.
Fortunately, driver behavior tends to remain within reasonably constant limits; as a result, traffic flows tend to be reasonably constant and can be mathematically approximated.
To better represent traffic flow, we need to establish relationships between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These reports are useful for the planning, design and operation of road installations.
Insects were the first animals that began to fly. The ability to fly allowed them to more easily avoid enemies and find food and mating partners much more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along the body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Nowadays, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and ephemeris.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite; that the Solar System actually revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
It seems reasonable because we don’t feel the Earth moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, having a width of about six miles.
No less than 20 percent of the water that drains into the oceans from the planet’s rivers comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River has 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It accumulates water from thousands of smaller waters.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and technical skill.
Ancient Egyptians who lived during the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments built by their predecessors, which at that time were already over a thousand years old.
The population of the Vatican City is around 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses the Italian language in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language used on a daily basis by the majority of those working in the country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the inhabitants of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
People have known since ancient times some fundamental chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper because they can be found in nature in their native state and are quite easy to exploit using simple tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, put forth a theory that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. These were water, earth, air and fire.
It reminded rather of the four states of matter, (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he had theorized that it was being transformed into another substance to take the form we see.
Alloys are actually combinations of two or more metals. Remember that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You will see that some alloys can also include small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter, all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions could fit into the point at the end of this sentence.
As a result, the pencil became the friend of many after it was created.
Unfortunately, as newer means of writing appeared, the pencil lost its status and number of uses.
People now write messages on computer screens without ever having to get their hands on a sharpener.
You can only wonder what the fate of the keyboard will be when something new appears.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Similar to pushing a heavy cart up the hill. Breaking the core again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with or without a pulse.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker in areas of higher relief.
There may be more maria in the near part, because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are focused on identifying elements that attract people’s attention or pleasure.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized with development into maturity.
These theories study what makes some people want to do what they do, and what their environment may or may not do.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Pyramid of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two Factor Theory.
In general, two types of behavior can occur when managers begin to lead former colleagues. An extreme consists of trying to remain "one of the boys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, carrying out disciplinary actions, evaluating performance, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
On the other side of the spectrum, people turn into unrecognizable individuals who think they have to change everything the team has done and proceed in their own style.
After all, the leader is primarily responsible for the success or failure of the team.
Often, this behavior leads to splits between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often have the role of providing a point of contact for the physical group they are part of.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams may meet depending on different time zones, which may not be understood by their local leadership.
The presence of a real “invisible team” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
“Invisible Team” is the management team to which each of the members reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each of the members.
Why would an organization want to go through the lengthy process of setting up a learning organization? One goal of putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When in the functional departments of an organization all available resources are used efficiently, creativity and ingenuity can freely manifest.
As a result, the process by which an organization works together to overcome an obstacle can lead to an innovative process for meeting customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing, and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used to get organizations to achieve higher performance.
Data in neurobiology are physical evidence that underlies a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. As such, it allows the narrowing of the research area and its definition with greater precision.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and tumors affect behavior and lead to changes in certain brain functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate previously unseen brain structures and processes.
This gives us a lot of information and material for building simulation models, which helps us understand the processes that take place in our minds.
Although AI has strong connotations of science fiction, AI is a very important part of computer science, which deals with behavior, learning, and adapting intelligence to machines.
AI research involves manufacturing machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to clients’ diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition.
Such actions have become separate disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, but several software applications for personal computers and video games have also been used.
Field trips are an important part of any class. Often, a teacher would like to take his students to places where a bus trip is not possible.
The technology offers the solution with virtual excursions. Students can look at museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful art while in class.
Virtually sharing a field trip is also a great way to reflect on the journey and share the experience with future classes.
For example, every year students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, every year the site is remodeled, and previous versions are kept online to serve as an album.
Blogs can also improve the student’s written expression. While students often start their blogging experience with careless grammar and spelling, the existence of an audience generally has the gift of changing the situation.
Since students often represent the most critical audience, the author of the blog begins to make efforts to improve his writing and avoid criticism.
“Blogging also ‘forces students to be more aware of the world around them.’ The need to respond to the interests of their audience inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).”
Blogging is a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their study far beyond the usual school day.
“The proper use of blogs <0xC2><0xAB>can help students to think more analytically and critically; by actively responding to materials found on the Internet, students can define their position in the context of those written by others, as well as outline their own perspectives on certain issues<0xC2><0xBB> (Oravec, 2002).”
Ottawa is Canada’s charming bilingual capital, offering a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada’s past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, and the north is home to the unspoiled natural beauty of the Muskoka District and more.
These and many others highlight Ontario as representative of what foreigners consider Canadian par excellence.
Large portions further north are fairly sparsely populated, and some are almost unpopulated wilderness.
To make a comparison between populations that has the gift of surprising many: the number of African-Americans living in the U.S. is greater than the entire population of Canada.
The eastern islands of Africa lie in the Indian Ocean, off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and a true continent in its own right when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or associated with France and are renowned as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also introduced Islam to those lands, which had great success in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region borders the Sahel, and to the south and west the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any woman who travels say she is married, regardless of her real marital status.
It is good to wear a wedding ring, but not to look expensive.
Women need to keep in mind that cultural differences can lead to what can be considered harassment and it is not out of the ordinary to be followed, grabbed by the hand, etc.
Be determined when you say no to a man and don’t be afraid to stand firm (cultural differences or not, it still doesn’t mean it’s OK!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used as a strategic port by Phoenicians, Romans and sailors, being called Anfa.
It was destroyed by the Portuguese, who rebuilt it calling it Casa Branca, but abandoned it again in 1755, following an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city under the name Daru l-Badya, and the name Casablanca was given to it by Spanish merchants who had established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the less interesting places in Morocco to go shopping.
Around the old Medina it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods such as tajines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs and a lot of all kinds of small things, but it is all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the far east, close to Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the settlement's streets, especially the downtown area.
While Goma is a fairly safe place, for visits outside the city an information effort is required to understand at what stage are the battles that are still being fought in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, also offering some of the cheapest mountain gorilla treks in Africa.
A boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) can be used to travel through Goma. The usual (local) price of a short trip is about 500 Congolese francs.
“Along with its relative inaccessibility, ‘Timbuktu’ has come to be used metaphorically with the sense of exotic, remote places.”
Nowadays, Timbuktu is a impoverished city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to the danger posed by desert sand.
It was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special, Wonders of the African World.
The city is in stark contrast to the rest of the country’s cities, as it has a more Arab than African flair.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa, bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting a different type of wildlife.
It is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is considered the emblem of the national parks of this country (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, there are daily entrance and conservation fees for the park.
It may also be useful to purchase a Wild Card, which allows entry either to a number of parks in South Africa or to all national parks in South Africa.
The name of the territory Hong Kong is given by the island of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists regard as the focal point.
The exhibition of buildings contributing to the Hong Kong skyline has been likened to a bright bar chart that is highlighted by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to Kowloon on the other side of the water.
The largest area of the urban developed part of Hong Kong Island is crammed into reclaimed land along the northern coasts.
This is the space that the British colonists have appropriated and therefore for anyone who is looking for evidence of the colonial past of the area, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest that lies on Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just swamps with mangroves, however – they also comprise some of the last remnants of the vast jungle that once covered the Ganges plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 km2, of which about a third is covered by water/swamp.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has become a sanctuary for wildlife and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses leave from the inter-district bus station (over the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since the buses connecting the districts are often full, it is advisable to purchase a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coastal buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Sharing a taxi is a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby destinations such as Paro (150 No) or Punakha (200 No).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge that spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
With the two pillars rising to a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has two strips of 3.50 meters wide.
The free height of passage under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaran<0xC3><0xAD> were the most important indigenous population group living in what is now eastern Paraguay.
The Chaco region was also home to other indigenous tribes, such as Guaycur<0xC3><0xBA> and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering and fishing.
"Paraguay, formerly called the Gigantic Province of the Indies, was born in the 16th century after Spanish conquistadors met its indigenous groups."
The Spanish began the period of colonization, which lasted for three centuries.
Since the city of Asunci<0xC3><0xB3>n was founded in 1537, Paraguay has preserved much of its indigenous identity.
Argentina is renowned as having one of the best polo teams and some of the best polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Ca<0xC3><0xB1>itas.
Smaller tournaments and matches also take place here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where you can buy tickets for polo games, check out the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), the value of which is set as the equivalent of 1 pound sterling (GBP).
You can exchange money at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds will generally be accepted everywhere on the islands, and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also frequently accepted.
On the outer islands credit cards will probably not be accepted, although they will probably receive British and American currency; contact the owners in advance to find out what means of payment they accept.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands pounds outside the country, so you must exchange them before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo lies south of the equator, there is summer when in the northern hemisphere it is winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical zone; in the summer months, temperatures frequently reach above 30°C.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the presence of wind and high humidity have the combined effect of making the perceived cold more intense than the thermometer indicates.
“There are no particularly ‘rainy’ or ‘dry’ seasons: the amount of rainfall remains about the same throughout the year.”
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wild animals are still wild and do not need to be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, you must keep a distance of at least 100 yards / meters from bears and wolves, respectively 25 yards / meters from other wild animals!
No matter how docile they may seem, the buffalo, moose, bear, and almost all other large animals can attack man.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they did not keep the correct distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so it is good to give them their space.
In addition, be careful that the smells can attract bears and other wild animals, so it would be advisable to avoid foods with a strong smell and keep the cleanliness in the camping site.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on Upolu Island and has a population of nearly 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a sad naval confrontation in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city resulted in the killing of the supreme chieftain Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, thanks to the fact that Auckland is between two ports. The most famous of these are in three areas.
North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district), located on the shores of the Pacific Ocean, stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
These are almost all sandy beaches where you can swim safely, and most have shade from the pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located in Waitemata Harbour, in the market suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a wide range of shops arranged along the shore.
The main local beer is “Number One”; it is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called “Manta”.
You can find a lot of French wines, but New Zealand or Australian wines would do better.
Local tap water is drinkable, but if you are afraid you can easily find bottled water.
For Australians, the idea of "flat white" coffee is unusual. A short black coffee is "espresso", cappuccino comes full-eyed with whipped cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is at the height of Belgian quality standards. Fruit juices are peppery in price, but very good.
Many visit the reef throughout the year, and injuries from any of these causes are rare.
However, follow the advice of the authorities, follow all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The box jellyfish is found near beaches and near river estuaries from October to April to the north of 1770. Occasionally, it can be found outside this period.
Sharks exist, but rarely attack man. Most sharks get scared of people and would swim away from them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actually live in the ocean, their main habitat being in river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind that he will have a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agents often have arrangements with certain hotels, but through a travel agent you can also make reservations for other forms of accommodation, such as campgrounds.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or even packages that combine flights and hotel accommodation.
They can also keep your booking if you need time to think about the offer or to procure other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
Any changes or requests must first be addressed to the travel agency, not directly to the hotel.
In the case of some festivals, the vast majority of participants in music festivals choose to camp on the spot, and most participants consider this an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you will have to arrive early to catch a campground close to the music.
Remember that although the music on the main stages has ended, there may be sections of the festival that will continue to play music until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you are crossing the North Baltic Sea in winter, pay attention to the location of the cabin, since navigating through the ice produces an unbearable noise for the most sensitive.
Cruises in St. Petersburg also include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (see conditions).
As a general rule, casinos make every effort to maximize the time spent here by customers and the money spent by them. Usually there are no windows and clocks, and the exits can be hard to find.
They usually have special offers of food, drink and entertainment, to keep the mood and the guests to stay in the premises.
Some clubs offer alcoholic beverages on the house side. However, drinking impairs judgment, and good players know how important it is to stay lucid.
Who will drive to high latitudes or through mountain passes must consider the possible presence of snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you can’t drive like on dry asphalt.
During the blizzard, in a very short interval, enough snow may fall to block you.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or blizzard snow or condensation, or ice formation on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic is mostly uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are probably Africa’s main tourist attraction and the highlight for many visitors.
The word safari, as it is commonly used, refers to land trips undertaken to see the stunning wildlife of Africa, especially those in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants or giraffes, tend to approach cars, and standard equipment will allow a good view of them.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you will be able to see them better using binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a bushwalk, safari hike, or walking) consists of hiking, either for a few hours or for a few days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will take place in other locations on the territory of Japan.
Tokyo, which also hosted the 1964 Summer Olympics, will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement is announced, you may face a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but at the end of March, coronavirus cancellation policies did not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between <0xC2><0xA5>2,500 and <0xC2><0xA5>130,000, with regular tickets costing around <0xC2><0xA5>7,000.
Ironing wet clothes can help them dry out. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board that you can borrow, even if they don’t exist in the room.
If you do not have an iron or if you do not like to wear ironed socks, then you can try using a hair dryer if you have one at hand.
Be careful not to let the material get too hot (which can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burning).
There are several ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas it is enough to boil water for a minute, in others it takes several minutes.
Filters differ in their level of efficiency, and if you’re worried, consider buying water in closed bottles from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests with which they are not familiar at home.
Pests can alter food, cause irritation or, in severe cases, cause allergic reactions, spread venom or spread infection.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill a human using physical force, are generally not considered harmful.
Duty-free shopping gives you the opportunity to buy duty-free goods in certain places.
Travelers who are due to visit high-tax countries can sometimes save considerable amounts, especially when it comes to products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The portion between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult traffic conditions on the entire length of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often crossing through isolated and undeveloped areas.
If you are used to driving on country roads, do not lose control: steep slopes, narrow lanes and dangerous curves predominate.
Speed limits are significantly lower than those in the previous sections – generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and it is all the more important to adhere to them strictly.
However, quite bizarrely, the mobile service is much more powerful here than along many other portions of the route, e.g. Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, similar to those of the southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, with apples being used throughout the year, and cherries and plums making their appearance in the summer.
Many German bakery products also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. Often, popular cakes go very well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small but rich pastries, taste what, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
A curry is a food based on herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
“A curry can be ‘dry’ or ‘liquid’ depending on the amount of liquid.”
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curry sauces; in southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a general term covering a wide variety of regional cuisines throughout the country.
Used without further qualification, however, the term tends to indicate food originating in the central and eastern parts of the main island, Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterized by a number of dishes seasoned with simplicity, the predominant Javanese tastes being peanuts, hot pepper, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various flavored spices.
The stairs support the legs of the rider, hanging on either side of the saddle.
They provide the rider with better stability, but can pose safety concerns as it is possible for a rider’s legs to get stuck in them.
If a rider falls off the saddle, but is left with one foot hanging from the ladder, the horse can drag him or her along when he or she is on the run. To minimize this risk, a number of precautions can be taken.
First of all, most of those who ride wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth and narrow sole.
Then some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the stair straps to detach from the saddle if pulled backwards by a rider falling from the saddle.
The Cocham<0xC3><0xB3> Valley - Chile's most sought-after climbing spot, known as Yosemite of South America, with a variety of high granite walls and peaks.
The summits offer breathtaking views from their summits. Climbers from all parts of the world continuously trace new routes through the walls with unlimited potential.
Sports that involve descending on snow, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that consist of sliding down the snow-covered terrain using skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is a major tourist activity for many enthusiasts, sometimes called “ski booms” in English, who organize whole holidays around skiing in a certain place.
The idea of skiing is extremely old – we have cave paintings depicting skiers as far back as 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 Norwegians opened Australia's first recreational ski club.
Backpacking on skis: This activity is also called skiing in unmarked areas, touring skiing or hiking on skis.
It is a related activity, but usually does not involve alpine skiing or mountaineering, the latter being carried out on much steeper terrain and requiring skis and boots much stiffer.
Think of the ski trail as a similar hiking trail.
In good conditions, you’ll be able to cover slightly longer distances than walking – but very rarely will you be able to reach typical cross-country speeds without a heavy backpack behind, on groomed pistes.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Normally, crossing several countries would mean repeatedly going through the procedures of obtaining a visa and passport control.
In this sense, the Schengen Area is organized in a way as a single country.
As long as you stay in this area, you can generally cross borders without having to do it at passport checkpoints.
Similarly, those who have a Schengen visa do not have to obtain a visa for each of the Schengen member countries, thus saving time, money and documents to obtain.
There is no universal definition to determine which items produced are antiques. Some tax agencies consider antiques to be goods that are more than 100 years old.
The definition varies by geographic location, where the age limit may be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Artisan products can be defined as antiques, although they are newer than similar mass-produced objects.
Reindeer breeding is an important source of income among the Sami, and trade-related culture is also important for many who have other trades.
However, traditionally not all members of the Sámi population were involved in the large-scale breeding of reindeer, but lived by fishing, hunting and the like, using reindeer more as pack animals.
Nowadays, many Sámi have modern occupations. Tourism is an important source of income for Sápmi, the Sámi area.
"Although it is widely used, especially among non-Roma, the word 'gypsy' is often considered offensive because of its association with negative stereotypes and an incorrect perception of the Roma population."
If the country you are about to visit is subject to a travel warning, your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also want to consult the advice of governments other than your own, but their advice is meant for their citizens.
An example would be how American citizens in the Middle East might face different situations compared to Europeans or Arabs.
The tips are just a brief summary of a country’s political situation.
Opinions are often presented in a superficial, general and oversimplified way, compared to more detailed information available elsewhere.
“Extreme weather” is a generic term used for any type of dangerous weather phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption or loss of life.
Extreme weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world and are of many kinds, depending on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy rainfall and uncontrolled fires are forms and effects of severe weather, as well as storms, tornadoes, waterspouts and cyclones.
Severe regional and seasonal climate phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are advised to be wary of the risks of severe weather affecting the area as it could mess up their travel plans.
It is advisable that anyone planning to travel to a country that can be considered a war zone has professional training.
An Internet search for “hostile environmental course” will likely provide you with the address of a local company.
Normally, a course will address in much more detail all the issues discussed here, usually through practical experience.
A course will usually last between 2-5 days and will include role-playing, much first aid and sometimes weapons training.
There are quite a few books and magazines dealing with survival in the wild, but there are few publications dealing with war zones.
Travellers planning to undergo a gender reassignment operation in another country must ensure that they have valid documents for the return journey.
The opening of governments to the possibility of issuing passports on which sex (X) is not declared or updated documents to match the desired name and sex is variable.
The willingness of foreign governments to accept these documents varies equally.
Searches at checkpoints also became much more intrusive after September 11, 2001.
Transgender people who have not yet undergone surgery should not expect to pass through the scanners without affecting their privacy and dignity.
Return currents represent the return flow to the ocean from waves breaking on the beach, often at a reef or similar formation.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections and there a rapid current can form towards the deep waters.
Most deaths occur due to exhaustion in an attempt to swim back against the current, which may prove to be impossible.
Once out of the current, swimming is no more difficult than normal.
Try to make your way to a position where you are not caught again, and depending on the skills you have and whether or not someone has seen you, you may want to wait to be rescued.
The shock of returning home manifests itself more quickly than the cultural shock (it persists less from the euphoria of the honeymoon), has a longer duration and can be more severe.
Travellers who have adapted easily to the new culture sometimes face particular difficulties in re-adapting to their native culture.
If you returned home after living abroad, you would have already adapted to the new culture and lost the habits of your native culture.
When you had just gone abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, being aware that visiting a new country requires an adaptation process.
The world does not always expect patience and understanding to be necessary for returning travelers.
The sound and light show organized at the pyramid is one of the most interesting things for children in the whole area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
Usually the noise made by tourists and vendors is constantly heard. The sound and light show seems detached from a story book.
The Sphinx is used as the background and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids and different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most bases, with sixteen being active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km to the north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingstone Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
The region to the south of the peninsula that is bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea is called Ellsworth Land.
The mountains of the Peninsula come together to give birth to this plateau, then separate again to form the 360 km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, separated in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part, called the Sentinel Range, are the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with Mount Vinson rising to 4,892 m.
In remote locations, without a phone signal, a satellite phone might be your only option.
A satellite phone generally cannot hold the place of a cell phone because you have to be outside with an unobstructed view of the satellite to be able to make a call.
The service is often used in shipping, including recreational craft, as well as by expeditions that require remote data and voice transmission.
Your local telephone service provider may be able to give you more information about connecting to this service.
An alternative increasingly used by people who plan a year off is to combine travel with study.
It is a popular activity especially among graduates, allowing them to take a year off before attending a university without jeopardizing their educational path.
In many cases, enrolling in a year of staggered courses abroad can even increase your chances of gaining access to higher education in your home country.
Normally, there is a tuition fee that is paid upon enrollment in these educational programs.
“Finland is a wonderful place for boating. The Land of a Thousand Lakes also has thousands of islands, both in these lakes and in the archipelagos along the coast.”
In archipelagos and lakes you do not necessarily need a yacht.
Although the archipelagos off the coasts and the largest lakes are really big enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is the national recreational activity of Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight inhabitants.
This happens in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands the figure is from 1 to forty).
Most dedicated Baltic cruises offer an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a few full days, returning to the ship at night to sleep.
If you only go on shore excursions on board a ship, you will not need a separate visa (starting in 2009)
Some cruise brochures show Berlin, Germany. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is by no means close to the sea and the visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be a terrifying experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they are flying for the first time or have had a traumatic experience.
It is not something to be ashamed of: it is no different from personal fears and dislikes of other things, which are manifested in very many people.
For some, understanding something about how an aircraft works and what happens during flight can be helpful in overcoming fear that is based on the unknown or lack of control.
Courier companies are well paid for fast deliveries. Often, delivery time is crucial in terms of documents, goods or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, larger companies own their own planes, but other routes and smaller companies had a problem.
If they sent something over the air, some routes can take days to unload and clear.
The only way to make it pass faster was to be sent as checked baggage. Airline regulations won’t allow them to send baggage without a passenger, and that’s where you step in.
The obvious way to fly first class or business is to pay a large pile of money for this privilege (or, even better, to convince your company to do it for you).
But it’s not cheap: in general, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare in business class, and up to eleven times more in first class!
In general, there is no point in looking for discounts for business class or I class seats for direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that there is a certain group of passengers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, context in which they charge rates according to requirements.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from inter-ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in the eastern part of Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member country.
Economic ties between these two parts of Moldova have been restored, despite the failure of political negotiations.
The dominant religion of Moldova is Christian Orthodoxy.
<0xC4><0xB0>zmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with about 3.7 million inhabitants, the second largest port after Istanbul and an excellent transport hub.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a bustling, developed and modern shopping centre, situated around an enormous bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, along with glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping centres, feature traditional 18th-century red-tiled roofs, as well as old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere reminiscent of Mediterranean Europe rather than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsv<0xC3><0xAD>k offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the courtyard of the church, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves above tombs.
It is worth spending half an hour walking through this amazing village.
To the north, easily accessible, lies the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which has become outside the country’s borders following an enthusiastic review of its splendours by Lord Byron.
The Scottburb 403 bus makes regular trips to Sintra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
Also in the north you can visit the Sanctuary of the Blessed Virgin of Fatima, a place known worldwide for the apparitions of St. Mary.
Please note that in principle you visit the site of a mass grave, as well as a site that has almost incalculable significance for a significant part of the world's population.
There are still alive many men and women who survived internment there, and many more who had family members who were killed or forced to work to death there, both Jews and others.
You are asked to treat the place with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not vandalize the place by drawing and making scratches on the existing structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Almost half prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and practically everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the panels are made only in Catalan, as it is established by law as the first official language.
However, Spanish is widely used in public transport, along with other services.
Periodic announcements on the metro are made only in Catalan, but unexpected interruptions are announced by an automatic system in different languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians are known as egocentric, rude and arrogant.
“Although it is often just a stereotype that does not conform to reality, to have a pleasant stay in Paris it is good to behave as well as possible, as someone who is <0xC2><0xAB> bien élevant <0xC2><0xBB> (well raised). It will help you to deal with it much more easily. <0xC2><0xBB>
The reserved attitude of Parisians quickly turns into a friendly one if you prove a minimum of politeness.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mainly with beech, spruce and fir trees and has a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It hosts a considerable variety of plant communities, thanks to its range of microclimates, different soil types and altitude levels.
The region is also home to an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat and mountain rooster can be found here, along with many other more common species.
When visiting monasteries, women must wear skirts that cover their knees and also cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries offer blankets for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one in bright colors, you will receive a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men should wear pants that cover their knees.
And they can be borrowed from those available at the entrance, but those clothes are not washed after every use, so you may not feel at ease wearing these skirts.
The cuisine of Majorca, like that of similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, greens and meat (especially pork), and olive oil is used in abundance.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil and tomatoes, with any available spices, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, as well as the word Sie, which means you, always start with a capital letter, even inside the sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
It also undoubtedly makes reading easier, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to discover the possibility of a verb or adjective being used in a nounized form.
The pronunciation of Italian words is relatively easy, most being pronounced exactly as they are written.
The letters you need to pay more attention to are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the vowel after them.
Also, be careful to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means car, while carro means car.
The Persian language has a relatively light and generally regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar manual will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand the phrases.
Obviously, those who know a Romance language will learn Portuguese more easily.
However, people who know a bit of Spanish can draw the premature conclusion that Portuguese is close enough that it does not need to be studied.
Pre-modern observatories are generally outdated nowadays and remain open as museums or educational places.
Since in their heyday light pollution was not as big a problem as it is today, they are usually found in cities or on campuses, being more easily accessible than those built in our times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge installations located in isolated areas that have favorable weather conditions.
The look of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been an integral part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where plum blossoms were the chosen flowers.
In Japan, the first parties dedicated to the cherry blossom were hosted by the emperor only for himself and other members of the imperial court aristocracy.
Plants don’t look any better than they do in their natural environment, so don’t give in to the temptation to harvest even “just one” of them.
If you visit a formally arranged garden, the collection of "specimens" will also lead to your expulsion, without discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place where you can easily orient yourself and buy almost anything as soon as you get there.
“But being in the ‘upper tropics’, just a few degrees north of the equator, you’ll have to face both the heat (always) and the strong sun (when it’s clear, less often).”
There are also several buses heading north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, along with their wives.
Check if the bus you want to take goes to Hebron and not to Kiryat Arba, the nearby Jewish settlement.
Inland waterways can be a good theme for organizing a holiday.
For example, visiting castles on the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley or taking a cruise to sites on the Danube or a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also define the routes for the popular hiking and cycling routes.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays of Christianity and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions relating to this holiday have been adopted by both non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night awake, in the open air, to see the sunrise.
For this tradition there are of course explanations in Christian theology, but it could very well be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
More traditionalist churches often hold an Easter vigil on Saturday evening on Holy Week, with congregations often gathering at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came here either swimming, flying or floating.
Because of the distance from the mainland, mammals have failed to make the journey, the result being that the giant tortoise is the main animal grazing in the Galapagos.
Since man’s arrival in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the areas of the Arctic or Antarctica in winter, you will experience polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon line.
This provides a good opportunity to see the aurora borealis, as the sky will be more or less dark at that time.
Because the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is therefore often not an issue, you will be able to enjoy the stars as well.
The Japanese culture of work has a stronger hierarchical and more formal character than that with which Westerners are accustomed.
Costumes are the standard clothing in business, and co-workers address each other using their last name or job title.
Harmony in the workplace is an essential element, with an emphasis on group effort rather than individual achievement.
Workers often have to obtain the approval of superiors for all decisions they make, and they are expected to follow the instructions of superiors without question.
