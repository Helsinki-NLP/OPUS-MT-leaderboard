Inflation, in Europe, has slipped on the food
Accelerated inflation, as measured in the euro area, is mainly due to the rapid rise in food prices.
In November, the increase in prices in the 13 euro zone countries was larger than expected, after an inflation rate of 2.6 percent in October, an annual inflation of 3.1 percent was recorded, said the statistics office of the European Community located in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts indicated only 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the U.S., British and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not lower the policy interest rate by saying that the decline in interest rates, with the growth of commodity prices and the fall in the unemployment rate, would lead to the generation of an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would like to keep the inflation rate below but close to two percent.
According to one analyst, it is the Catch 22 for the ECB: "we must deter" inflation so as not to have to intervene on this subject later.
In Germany, the inflation rate of 3.3 per cent is a record in the last twelve years and in Spain it has risen from 3.6 to 4.1.
Inflation in the euro area took off due to the rapid rise in food and energy prices.
Grain futures market shares rose 88 percent and soybean prices also reached their highest value since 1973.
The price of edible oil and dairy products also increased significantly in 2007.
This year, the world price of oil rose by 52 percent, and last month a barrel of black gold cost nearly $100.
According to the ECB, in 2008 the inflation rate will rise from 2.1 per cent this year to 2.5 per cent, but in 2009 it will fall to 1.9 per cent.
According to analysts, the 12-month inflation rate remains around 3 percent, however, for the next 3-4 months, the annual average rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to lower the key rate twice in 2008.
Gallup warns of government crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of supporters of Fidesz (Alliance of Young Democrats) increased significantly at the beginning of December, so since 2002, it currently has the largest number of supporters, while Gallup (Polling Institute) has never before seen such low socialist support, namely 13 percent.
For loyal voters, the difference would represent, due to the greater determination of the opposition voters, a support of more than two-thirds (71 percent) against the support of one-fifth (20 percent) for the MSZP (Hungarian Socialist Party).
According to the poll, the MDF (Forum of Hungarian Democrats) and the SZDSZ (Alliance of Free Democrats) are below the threshold of parliamentarians: their support is two percent in the entire population.
On the faithful voters certain to go vote, the number of supporters of both parties increased by 1 percent.
The economic climate has continued to deteriorate from the previous lowest point, the proportion of those who felt that the country's economic situation was particularly serious has never been so high, it amounts to 41 per cent and according to 46 per cent complementary the situation is quite serious.
After the more optimistic outlook of last spring and summer, families are once again more pessimistic about their financial situation.
For next year, the majority of the population anticipates an aggravation and only a tenth anticipates an improvement of the situation.
Last December, 71 percent of those polled, a majority never seen in Gallup’s previous polls, felt the prime minister was doing his job rather poorly than well.
13 percent of respondents have confidence or a lot of confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány while 38 percent support Viktor Orbán.
54 percent do not trust the prime minister at all and 27 percent do not trust the president of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of the change in the political situation is the proportion of society who believe that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister can be dealt with without a change of government.
While 35 per cent of those polled wanted the government and prime minister to remain in office after the October riots, that figure currently stands at only 20 per cent, and the relative majority (33 per cent) believe that holding new elections would be the solution to this situation.
When asked about the intention to vote, 60 percent of respondents said they would certainly vote and the additional 20 percent said they would probably vote.
For comparison, for a "legislative election to be held next Sunday", only 55 per cent of respondents would certainly participate and 15 per cent additional would probably participate. According to current intentions, the result of the referendum would not be in doubt.
74 percent of people would say no to higher education fees, 79 percent would say no to consultation fees, and 84 percent would say no to hospital stay fees.
When we look only at the same proportions among people who expressed their intention to vote in the referendum, respectively 81, 84 and 89 percent of voters would reject the introduction of registration fees, consultation fees and hospital stay fees.
Auchan is the most expensive, Tesco has increased its prices by almost twenty percent
The hypermarkets located in the Buda<0xC3><0xB6>rs commercial triangle maintained last year's average price increase of 16 percent with the difference that this year the VAT rate did not increase.
Article by Napi Gazdaság (Daily Economy)
This year, in the Buda<0xC3><0xB6>rs commercial triangle, the usual daily Christmas basket also increased by 16 percent on average, a value increase of well over one thousand forints was displayed in all hypermarkets.
Prices, “which had already soared” in major grocery stores last December, have no longer risen sharply compared to the previous high base.
Nevertheless, consumers are obviously shocked to see that items purchased well below nine thousand forints last year now cost more than ten thousand forints.
The Daily Basket in the surveyed hypermarkets exceeded by 91 forints, at least, the psychological threshold of ten thousand forints.
And the highest value of the basket amounted to 10,573 forints.
(In 2003, this value was 6,800 forints.)
The prices of unicum and live fish remained almost at last year's level, however the prices of turkey fillet, walnut and poppy have risen sharply.
In the stores, the price of flour and bread followed the data of the KSH (Central Institute of Statistics) but, at Auchan, bread from one kilo to 139 forints only was found.
The competition did not lower the price of the product below 200 forints.
It was surprising to see, also in this hypermarket, that the price of the two-litre Coca-Cola consigned bottle was below 200 forints, so it only cost 257 forints the consigned bottle included.
However, this year, in terms of daily basket, Auchan was the most expensive and Cora the cheapest.
According to our calculations, Cora increased the price of her Daily Basket by 15 percent while Tesco and Auchan increased them by about 18 and 18 percent respectively.
Comparing the most expensive basket of last year and the cheapest basket of this year, we find a difference of 12 percent while the difference between the cheapest basket of last year and the most expensive basket of this year is 21 percent.
Prices increased by 1,480 forints on average.
Last year, prices increased by 1,206 forints on average, while the impact of the VAT rate increase was already noticeable in last year's Christmas prices.
This process has perplexed the trade, hypermarkets could not visibly determine what margin to apply on products so they were unable to predict the impact of price change on consumption.
(If a trader miscalculates the rotation of a product, he may lose a large profit on the margin adapted to the intensity of the trade.)
Due to the change in the VAT rate, the price increase of the Daily Basket evolved so excessively that the most expensive basket was 1,720 forints higher than the value of 2006 whereas the difference between the cheapest baskets was only 844 forints.
This year, the difference was not so excessive since the value of the most expensive basket was higher by 1,630 forints than last year and the prices of the cheapest rose by 1,284 forints too.
Bringing the two seasons of Christmas closer together, we have seen a catastrophic increase in prices, in less than 20 months the prices of everyday consumer items have risen by more than 30 percent in hypermarkets.
(This does not necessarily confirm KSH's data: for some staple foods, the Institute of Statistics found a price increase of more than 30 percent in 12 months.
This is the case, for example, with flour and egg.)
According to the Daily Basket of the latter, this seems almost absurd since the price level of this product, already very expensive last year, has increased by just over 10 percent compared to the base.
According to the indexes, flour suppliers occupy a stronger position than egg suppliers because they have managed to get multinationals to accept the sharp increase in prices as well.
In the commercial golden triangle, hypermarkets do not complain, they constantly record good years.
In our experience, the majority of customers no longer look at prices in the three hypermarkets visited.
They buy everything in quantity, they take the food of long conservation by pallets.
On Wednesday morning, large queues formed at the checkouts of the three hypermarkets as the number of customers increased sharply.
However, according to our information, the turnover is less important in the province, many multinationals complain to survey companies that they do not even reach the expected turnover, not only for food but also for sustainable consumption items.
Many hospitals save money on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections, mainly caused by the incorrect use of antibiotics, have been recorded in hospitals.
The hygienic conditions of hospitals, the insufficient number of beds, the overwork of medical staff do not help to block infections, says the chief doctor of the National Epidemiology Center.
Many hospitals are also saving on disinfectants
Not long ago an MRSA infection was diagnosed at the traumatology department of János Hospital.
Antibiotic-resistant bacteria have been detected in a man hospitalized after a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year a similar infection occurred in the same place.
The injured from a serious car accident was released from the hospital but shortly after he had to return due to an MRSA infection and since then, doctors have not been able to perform a major operation because of the bacteria that is in his body.
As of December 10 this year, 1,094 hospital-acquired infections generated by a multidrug-resistant pathogen have been reported to the National Nosocomial Surveillance System, said Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>cz, chief physician at the National Epidemiology Centre.
To know that it is the number of infections caused by a multidrug-resistant pathogen that has actually been registered in hospitals and for the rest we have no information.
About two-thirds of infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, i.e. methicillin-oxacillin resistant staphylococcus aureus.
One-third of people carry Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their noses without it developing a disease.
Infections caused by AS (such as angina, tonsillitis, skin infections, traumatic infections) respond well to antibiotics, they are easily curable.
However, if antibiotics are used excessively or inappropriately, the bacterium, which reacts well to antibiotics, will develop a well-resistant bacteria that will proliferate rapidly in poor hospital conditions.
In case of temporary or prolonged malfunction of the immune system, this bacterium can cause serious hospital infections, such as traumatic infection or sepsis, on elderly patients, of small weights or with a weakened organism.
According to the medical director of the János hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infections, these infections are part of the daily life of hospitals.
It is important not to confuse the infection with the epidemic, we do not find MRSA only where we do not look for them, said Tibor Nyulasi.
SAs are resistant to antibiotics.
“These patients are isolated, caregivers are wearing rubber gloves and protective masks and we have antibiotics adapted to treat them,” said Tibor Nyulasi.
A priori, hospitalized patients are examined if they are carriers of MRSA, however the infection can not always be avoided.
The sampling of the sample is not fashionable
The vast majority of infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but the current conditions and circumstances in Hungarian hospitals are not favorable for preventing the development and proliferation of multidrug-resistant pathogens, says Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>cz.
As this infection occurs mostly in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should monitor hospitalized patients and immediately isolate patients with MRSA.
However, microbiological sampling is not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
It should be noted that the National Social Security Fund does not fund these examinations.
Most cases arise only if the MRSA infection is detectable on the patient, said the chief doctor of the epidemiological center.
The European Union has stringent recommendations on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine and there are Hungarian guidelines also for the healing of certain infections and syndromes.
Efforts must be made to target antibiotic therapy, i.e. microbiological tests should be performed to prevent drug resistance, but this is not always taken into account by hospitals.
Microbiological sampling is even rarer in outpatient and basic care, said Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>cz.
Many hospitals save money on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA proliferates from one patient to another most often through medical personnel.
It is therefore essential to wash your hands, put on gloves and protective masks. However, significant gaps are also detected in hospitals in this area.
MRSA proliferates through infection transmitted by inhalation of droplets and through contact. However, due to conditions in Hungarian hospitals, the infected patient cannot always be isolated.
In addition, the rooms are often full, the beds are often too close to each other while in terms of epidemic, the sick should be away from each other by a minimum of 1.5 meters.
Unfortunately, we also see that hospitals, in difficult financial situations, are saving on disinfectants, they lack nurses, the sick are numerous, so the risk of contamination is even greater, said Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>cz.
According to Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>cz, in hospitals or preventive measures are respected, the number of infections is demonstrably lower or else the proliferation of the pathogen can be blocked.
Government project against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA infection represents an exorbitant expense for social security funds, which is why this infection is being fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has established a program to prevent or reduce the incidence of MRSA.
According to published data, this program is effective and MRSA infections show a decreasing trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has identified the prevention of the incidence of multidrug-resistant pathogens (such as MRSA) as one of its priorities, as well as the prevention of hospital-acquired infections caused by these pathogens.
The commissioner, who was involved in a fatal accident, was not intoxicated.
The official statement regarding the fatal accident caused by the commissioner of the 22nd arrondissement was drawn up.
It can be excluded that the commissioner of the 22nd arrondissement, resigned from his post since, who crushed a pedestrian causing his death last Tuesday, would have driven drunk or dizzy, said Friday Attila Morvai, spokesman for the Public Prosecutor's Office of the capital after the relative finding has been established.
The finding confirmed the first result of the investigation which has already found that the former commissioner had not consumed alcohol before getting behind the wheel
Last Tuesday, the former head of the police station of the 22nd arrondissement crushed a 55-year-old man who found himself in front of him when he turned, with his personal car, in the Kossuth Lajos street of the 22nd arrondissement. The man wanted to cross the road by not passing through the pedestrian crossing.
(Furthermore, the fact that he crossed the road outside the pedestrian crossing is not a mitigating circumstance, under the Highway Traffic Act a car that initiates a turn must allow pedestrians to pass.)
The pedestrian died after being taken to the hospital.
Following this accident, the Commissioner resigned from his position and requested his retirement because, according to the police communication, this accident greatly upset him.
The investigation into this case is being conducted by the Budapest Prosecutor's Office.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former commissioner cooperated from the beginning with the magistrates responsible for conducting the investigation.
Additional €400 million for infrastructure
János Veres, Hungary's finance minister, and Marta Gajecka, vice-president of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed on Friday in Budapest three agreements worth a total of 400 million euros for a credit line to support education, transport and environment infrastructure as well as energy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) adopted a budget of EUR 300 million for the Hungarian budget financing of transport and environment projects to be carried out from the Cohesion Fund, of which a credit agreement worth EUR 100 million has already been signed by the parties, this time the signed contract concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The agreement on the EUR 150 million credit also concerns the budgetary financing of education-related projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for Hungary, the remaining EUR 150 million to be used later, following the extension of the credit agreement.
The parties have signed a contract of 50 million euros for innovation, the state budget will use this envelope first of all in the framework of the research and development project to be carried out at the University of Debrecen.
During the negotiations, the project of the metro line 4 was also discussed.
The parties agreed that they would discuss the possible modification of the initial contract when Hungary finalised the details of the financing of the metro with the EU.
According to János Veres, this could happen in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has provided a total of EUR 8.4 billion for the financing of 113 projects in Hungary.
The EIB grants its loans at the EURIBOR-related interest rate, with a grace period of 8 years and no commitment fee.
Bulgaria, paradise of the EU real estate market
The evolution of the Bulgarian real estate market is spectacular, the attention of all Europe is focused on this country of the Balkans little mentioned in the past.
What, or and who bought in this EU market that is still the cheapest but will quickly become expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
Currently, in real estate, Bulgaria is unquestionably the most fashionable target in Eastern Europe with its cheap ski apartments and seaside houses.
In the mountains, the most popular regions are Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa and, by the sea, Albena, the "Golden Sands", the "Sun Coast", the ancient Sozopol and Nessebar but more and more people are looking for a building in the region of Kavarna and Balcik too.
According to analysts of Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later, the central region of the country, namely Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, will also arouse the interest of investors and they are also increasingly buying in the very cheap corner of Ruse.
Sofia, the capital, also offers attractive opportunities, with retail and office spaces promising the highest amortization rate.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe and thus be a priority destination, after the summer season and the winter season, also in the other two seasons of the year.
More vigilant investors are already buying in large numbers, for example in the corner of Bansko.
According to analysts, people buying a building in Bulgaria are at the same time looking to change their life, their way of life.
Most of the buyers are English but others come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present. On the shores of the Black Sea and in the most famous ski resorts, we traditionally meet many Russian buyers.
Foreign buyers are divided into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
People who plan to settle buy renovated buildings, at a price ranging from 50 to 100 thousand euros, or dilapidated old houses, at a price ranging from 5 to 15 thousand euros, which are then renovated.
The criteria are easy access and communication possibilities, proximity to a large city, shops and in general that of the local doctor.
The second group includes buyers of second homes (since last December, Bulgaria has been listed among the top 10 holiday destinations in Germany).
The third group is made up of commercial investors who buy in the hope of achieving added value in the medium or long term.
The price of real estate in the capital is constantly increasing due to an increasingly strong demand.
In the European Union, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria. However, in the last 5 years they have increased by 21 percent each year.
The increase in real estate prices essentially exceeds the increase in wages.
Fodor and the Six Percent Hungarians
According to the communication of Gábor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Water, the meetings of the professionals will end on Tuesday, however, Wednesday, after the official opening, the negotiations of the ministers on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world will discuss the Bali Road Map, which is supposed to define the efforts to be made after the emission reduction period defined by the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
At the moment, there are lively discussions on this subject between developing and developed countries.
The United States also reported that, for the time being, it did not want to discuss exact figures, while it was ready to sign an agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 25 to 40 percent from 1990 levels by 2020.
Another important topic of the conference is whether developed countries commit to providing financial and technological assistance to countries in need, excluding emission reductions.
An agreement was also signed on aid to developing countries.
The aid fund defined by the Kyoto Protocol will be managed by a board of directors composed of 16 members probably within the framework of the Global Environment Facility (GEF), said Piac és Profit (Market and Profit).
The Six Percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Gábor Fodor, Minister for Environment and Water, confirms the EU's ambition to maintain its role as a flagship in global efforts to protect the climate and encourage the signing of the new international agreement before 2009.
The minister explained that the EU is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels, regardless of the success of the signing of the “Post-2012 Agreement”, and is ready to reduce them by up to 30 percent if other major regions of the world and/or developing countries are also ready to make commitments tailored to their responsibility and capabilities.
Gábor Fodor recalled that in 1997, the signatory countries of the Kyoto Protocol had in total targeted a reduction of 5.2 per cent and all 15 EU members at that time made the commitment on 8 per cent less.
Hungary has made a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent compared to the level of the period between 1985 and 1987, our country will fulfill its commitment, recalls the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The stakes are high in Bali because the long-term international agreement on climate policy must be put in place in the interval of two years, otherwise the entry into force of the agreement would certainly be postponed after 2012. In this case, the commitments of reduction below the values provided for in the Kyoto Protocol will not be immediately followed by a new international system of emission reduction whose need has been stressed in the new report' s international climate change report.
The reduction of emissions would be delayed and the increase in the average temperature of the Earth of more than 2 degrees Celsius could no longer be avoided which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irrevocable consequences.
UK army recruits on YouTube
British Army units are sharing video-sharing footage of their operations in Iraq and Afghanistan with the aim of making themselves popular.
First, it was the British Air Force (RAF) that became passionate about YouTube: special units intervening in Afghanistan upload video footage of operations carried out against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC reported.
These recordings, taken using miniature helmet-mounted cameras, are monitored at the air force operations headquarters in Kandahar and are then transferred to London where compatriots upload them to the Internet.
The political message is inescapable.
Air force soldiers have already spent 139 sequences on the net by this route and their "chain" was watched by more than 75 thousand people.
The British Ministry of Defence registered as "defenceheadquarters" in the spring of 2007 and it releases videos on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan while the Commonwealth Office and the International Peacekeeping Forces in Iraq (MNFI) also have their own YouTube channels.
Mission in Afghanistan
According to the initial objective of the air force, the videos were passed on the net to recruit; according to the Ministry of Defense, they were also used to make the general public aware of the real objectives of the army's presence abroad.
The propaganda published in this way costs practically nothing compared to the usual recruitment advertisements on television, Gordon Mackenzie, a defence consultant, told the BBC; on the other hand, it also inevitably carries a political message since it justifies in a special form the merits of military operations decided by the government.
The Americans made a game.
The army is annoyed because, apart from carefully composed and censored videos, amateur videos are passed on the sharing site that also present, for example, the death of soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, a little hypocritical, the officers do not avoid talking about the losses but they never present the bloody side of the fight.
Moreover, many videos had already been posted on the net showing the areas of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan that were carried out on a real mission, but the British army has only recently been excited about the loading of these videos.
The Americans recruit a little differently by using the shooting game America's Army downloadable for free. In this game the player can put himself directly in the place of the soldiers as part of a more or less real simulation.
Christmas raffle and donuts in the ministries
M<0xC3><0xB3>nika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not seem to be sentimental: instead of celebrating Christmas, she will hold a year-end meeting with her collaborators who will be able to say goodbye to the year 2007 by taking donuts and coffee.
Another ministry will host a party with live music, another will enchant officials with a raffle and offer a drink to create a Christmas atmosphere.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet, so the power is entertained.
Public authorities are also preparing for Christmas.
This year, the biggest Christmas party will be organized by the Ministry of Defense but it is not the employees of the ministry who will be invited.
At Christmas, orphans, children of fallen soldiers will receive gifts, for missionary Christmas, family members of soldiers currently serving in foreign missions are invited and a press reception will also take place.
The ministry is planning a budget of 25 million forints to create the end-of-year atmosphere.
In comparison with other ministries, the National Development Agency (NF<0xC3><0x9C>) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) will celebrate.
The GKM party will be held in the House of the Future with a total budget of 4,320,000 forints and, of the six hundred employees in bulk, three hundred and fifty are expected there.
During this party, the Christmas atmosphere will be de rigueur, there will be actors and also a raffle.
The Christmas of the NF<0xC3><0x9C> cost 4,700,000 forints and was organized on Wednesday in the building of the National Council of Justice (ILO) with concerts and a dinner.
Renting the hall cost one million forints, the rest was spent for the more than four hundred guests.
According to our information, a service of the NF<0xC3><0x9C> is invited to another Christmas party that is organized with European money by the National Center for Economic Development, a company that manages tenders.
The building of the Thé<0xC3><0xA2>tre de la Ga<0xC3><0xAE>té was rented for these purposes.
This information was not confirmed by MAG Zrt because we were unable to reach the person in charge.
Costume is not mandatory
The ILO building not only hosted the NF<0xC3><0x9C> but also the Ministry of Justice and Police, which, instead of a Christmas party, held a ball on the occasion of St. Luca on 7 December.
The ILO did not charge them for the use of its rooms.
The ball was attended by five hundred people.
The party began with the minister's words of welcome and the dinner was followed by a live music dance party.
Answer to the question of [origo]: the evening outfit was not at all mandatory at this ball.
The ministries of health, labour and local authorities are preparing a sober party.
The Ministry of Health will organize a show and a party for its employees, within its walls, for 400,000 forints.
On the other hand, M<0xC3><0xB3>nika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not officially invite her employees to a Christmas party but to a work meeting at the end of the year.
One hundred and eighty people are expected to be invited to have a coffee and eat donuts, the press service said, the party will cost only 350,000 forints.
Gordon Bajnai, Minister of Local Government, will simply invite his colleagues to have a drink in the classroom of the Ministry of Local Government and Territorial Planning.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will hold a Christmas party in its large hall at which 436 employees are expected.
He plans to spend 2,500 forints per guest including a buffet and a drink.
Since the arrival of János Veres, the PM's employees celebrate Christmas every year in the same way.
No party atmosphere planned, the official character is reinforced not only by the presentation of the minister but also by the time of the party taking place in the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture will hold a reception on January 20 to celebrate the new year, the Christmas party will not take place.
The reception will be held at Vajdahunyad Castle, located in the Bois de ville, and according to the ministry’s communication, 1,000 forints per person are calculated for the one hundred guests.
According to the press service, this will be a very simple cocktail to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
These cocktails, organized every year, are started with a few words of welcome from the minister followed by a modest meal.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture are not celebrating Christmas at all, the respective press services have communicated to [origo].
The press service of the Ministry of the Environment did not know the price of the official Christmas party.
However, more than four hundred people were invited to the party organized at the Museum of Decorative Art.
The forces of the mega-strike are gathering
The unions of the League and the National Association of Workers' Councils will constitute, on Friday, their strike commission which will be in charge of coordinating Monday's indefinite strike.
On Saturday, a general assembly of protest will be held and on Monday, the day of the final vote on the law on health funds, the strike will begin.
This action will certainly cause significant traffic jams because rail traffic will be stopped almost completely and the employees of BKV (public transport company) will also strike until 1pm.
The unions of the league will make known, Friday afternoon, the details of their strike of Monday, organized with the National Association of workers' councils.
The strike commission of LIGA - MOSZ will also be constituted, it will serve as coordinator of the actions of Monday.
On Saturday, a general assembly of protest will be held and, from Monday, the organizations joining the strike will stop work for an indefinite period if they fail to reach an agreement with the government.
This means that the date of the end of the strike, from the day of the vote in parliament on the law on health insurance funds, is not defined.
If the National Assembly does not adopt the law on health funds, the unions will immediately withdraw the call for strike action.
On the other hand, if the law is passed, the strike committees will meet and decide what to do next.
According to Monday's agenda of the national assembly, it is likely that the vote on the law on health funds will take place only late at night, or even at night.
Due to the strike scheduled for Monday, significant traffic jams are expected: the railways will stop work for an indefinite period and during the morning part of public transport in Budapest and more than half of Volán companies are at risk of being stopped.
At the same time, at different points in the country, half of the road will also be blocked.
Many unions and civil organizations have joined the call for a strike, the list of which is constantly updated on the League's website.
Some organizations report going on strike for an indefinite period, others have declared a temporary stoppage of work.
Until Thursday afternoon the M<0xC3><0x81>V (Hungarian Railways) and the Free Union of Railway Workers (VDSZSZ) have not been able to find an agreement on the minimum services, but, as the Christmas holidays approach, more and more people are taking the train.
According to current communications, the Budapest public transport will strike from the start of service until 1pm, the Budapest airport between 7am and 9am, the Industrial Trade Unions of Electricity and Thermal Energy of the League will strike for four hours, the Teachers' Union and the Democratic Teachers' Union have called for a strike for 2 hours and 2 hours respectively.
The National Association of Physicians will go on strike throughout the country alternately, the Syndicat des employés de la santé et du secteur social (EDDSZ) attached to the SZEF will go on a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands, formulated by the League, demands that the government withdraw its proposal on health reform and submit a new conception to social debate.
The second claim requires that the new method of calculating the pension to be implemented from next year is introduced in several stages.
The third claim is for a guarantee, in terms of retirement before the legal age, which would make it possible to transfer into the system the functions that deserve it before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is the rejection by the Free Union of Railway Workers (VDSZSZ), attached to the Trade Unions of the League, of the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport concerning secondary railway lines and the expectation of another proposal.
Political Capital: the Hungarian Guard has increased the country risk
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital (Risk Analysis Division), the activity of the Hungarian Guard, formed last August, with the support of the Jobbik Magyarországért Mozgalom (Movement for a Better Hungary) increases, in several aspects, the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In its “Risk Warning”, the company points out that, in connection with the activity of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is already that “in the short term aggressive ethnic clashes may occur as a result of the aggravation of the already existing ethnic tension between the Gypsy and non-Gypsy population of Hungary”.
The research institute added that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard likely aimed at provoking this situation is the main reason.
As they say, this is explained by one of the main shortcomings of Hungarian political actors: "public actors have passed the public debate on the Roma case to representatives of radical and extreme political groups that have based a political strategy on the dispute between Gypsies and Hungarians".
The problem is compounded, normal dialogue becomes impossible, extremists are reinforced and aggressive conflict is more likely, they say.
However, according to the research institute, under the effect of the increased attention of the Hungarian and international media, the activity of the Hungarian Guard "has significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary abroad, especially with regard to confidence in the stability and democratic maturity of the country".
They recall that, as a result of increased publicity given to the reorganisation of radical and extreme right-wing groups in Hungary since the autumn of 2006, numerous associations have been formed in Hungary since the summer of 2007 calling themselves the "national association for self-defence".
“The common feature of these gatherings is that they define themselves as a civil organization while they publicly declare the preparation of their adherents for defense missions (catastrophes, national defense, defense of order), armed if necessary, moreover, evoking the incapacity of the police, the army, in other words of the state,” they added.
They pointed out that everything was going according to the method that, based on the rancour of the political society and the parties, seeks to disguise different political ambitions under a civil aspect.
The emphasis on civil character and association status thus serves only to avoid the legal pitfalls of registering these associations with the court but they also constitute a political strategy.
The analysis indicates that the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a factor that also increases the risk in relation to neighbourly relations.
“In recent months, many neighbouring countries have cited the Hungarian Guard as a potential source of risk and ultra-nationalist political actors in some neighbouring countries wish to justify their anti-Hungarian policy by referring to the constitution of the Hungarian Guard.
This influences the political stability of the region,” they added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Central Eastern Europe, political risks have increased throughout the region.
As they say, the functioning of the Hungarian Guard resembles, for example, the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard whose constitution was declared by the Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in August 2007.
The numerous Roma riots that broke out in a neighborhood of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana) are the origin of the constitution of the Bulgarian guard.
Taking advantage of these events, BNU decided to set up a guard, saying that the organization's goal is "national self-defense."
According to them, over the past 17 years, the gypsies have “terrorized” Bulgaria, but the state has remained inactive and neutral, recalls Political Capital.
They added that the initiative had sparked lively debates in Bulgarian public opinion.
As they say, the declaration of some Bulgarian Roma organizations regarding the constitution of their own guard as resistance signals the increased risk of ethnic clashes.
The functioning of the Hungarian Guard showing similarities with that of the Bulgarian National Guard does not exclude that Hungarian Roma react to the threat in the same way by organizing their own self-defense, reads the warning of risk of Political Capital.
At the request of the telegraph agency, Attila Juhász, research director of Political Capital, said: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, their risk analysis is published every year and if events occur that could impact the change in risk, they inform the public, as in this case, by publishing a risk warning.
The party is not marked in red everywhere
In Hungary, the law defines exactly the holidays and, around the holidays, it has become common to reorganize the working days whose number will decrease next year.
The holidays are not uniform in the EU and the US either.
Hungarian legislation distinguishes between national and state holidays as well as days of rest.
Rest days are often linked to religious festivals or important historical events.
In Hungary, we celebrate the New Year, the last day of the year that ends and the first day of the New Year are also days of rest, the latter all the more so that the New Year's Eve can rest quietly.
In addition, in a year, we have a total of eleven festivals marked in red.
March 15 is a national holiday, in commemoration of the 1848 revolution, as is October 23, which is also the day commemorating the 1956 revolution.
On August 20th, we celebrate the constitution of our state, May 1st is Labor Day and on November 1st and 2nd, we remember our deceased family members and friends.
In addition, we have two days at Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
The days of our state, national or even religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, according to the calendar, it has become common to reorganize the working days in cases where there is only one working day left before or after the holiday marked in red.
It is true that we pay the price of extended weekends by working or going to school on the Saturday before the extended weekend.
For many years, the Minister of Labour has ruled in a special regulation on the days of replacement of the days before or after the holidays.
The law extends to all employers and their employees, to civil servants and to persons working in the public service.
It does not apply, however, to service companies, to institutions that operate without interruption and in service, because of their vocation, and also to days of rest.
This year, the working days will be changed only around the end of the year holidays: from December 24, life stops almost all over the country because according to experience the majority of people instead work overtime or take holidays that they have saved for these purposes to be able to spend the days between Christmas and New Year's Day at home.
Next year many holidays fall in the middle or end of the week, therefore there will be fewer changes in the level of working days compared to this year.
The calendar will be reorganized the first time around Labor Day to allow employees to stay at home four days in a row.
Saturday, April 25th will be a working day to have a rest day on Friday, May 2nd.
Another change is planned for October 23rd: Saturday October 18th will be a work day replacing Friday 24th.
On the other hand, next year, the end of the year is announced under the sign of the holidays because from December 24, everyone will take a non-stop break even if New Year's Day falls on a Wednesday.
Six Futile Things That Can Hurt Colleagues Terribly
Emails we forget to send, voice messages we never receive, innocent lies that annoy us almost more: these are things that “beautify” the daily life of a workplace.
The question is whether one gets used to these troubles or takes up the challenge and consciously avoids ambiguous situations, causing trouble to others.
Examples.
“Excuse me, I forgot to tell you that you were called from the marketing department,” a colleague tells you.
That you missed a date?
At best he is sorry and tries to fix things by calling the marketing department to tell them that he forgot to pass the message (this is the least common solution).
In most cases, this is done with an apology.
Before you have painful explanations, it’s helpful to think about how you might cause unpleasant moments to your colleagues and make efforts to avoid them.
Borrow something that doesn't belong to you?
There is nothing more annoying than wanting to take a folder, an office tool or the phone and you can’t find them anywhere.
Remember the day before you put the stapler on the desk but it disappeared the next morning?
Do you happen to find your pen that you thought was lost on your colleague's desk?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without asking, or they're right to be mad at you for stealing their property.
Do not bring envelopes, post-it notes in your pocket because it can be annoying that there are no more and you need them right away.
Are you talking about co-workers' privacy?
There are no good ways to stop gossip from spreading.
Who did what, with whom?
Or and why?
Do not tell everyone your information (suppositions) about the privacy of your colleagues!
If a colleague shares his intimate secrets with you, do not abuse his trust!
Bury the shared information in yourself and do not discuss it with your colleagues in his absence even if your colleagues are also aware of it.
Do you call yourself sick for no good reason?
When you call the office and declare yourself sick under the pretext of a heartbreaking headache because you feel bad or feel you need rest that day, think about the fact that your work, your urgent affairs, your future missions must be carried out by someone else in your place.
Don't get your colleagues in trouble!
If you know in advance that you will not go to work the next day or that something may happen that would force you to stay at home, do not forget to notify your boss and your colleagues to avoid that they are surprised by your absence the next day.
Chilling, snickering, phone
Do you immerse yourself in your work but the sneering of your colleagues brutally snatches you away?
Have you unwittingly become a witness to a telephone conversation that you would have been better off not listening to?
Do not disturb your colleagues with humming, chanting, loud discussions (that you lead above their head), beating of feet, big words or discontent expressed out loud.
They can be annoying even if your colleagues are not immersed in a project (writing, design, organization).
Do you blame others for a mistake?
If your work is not done for the set deadline, you forget to send a mail or an important message, do not accuse anyone for this forgetfulness!
Don’t put it on the account of possible chaos in the office or your noisy colleagues!
Recognize it if you have made a mistake and if it has presented disadvantages for others, make up for the mistake!
Ask how you could make up for your mistake, make up for the negligence!
Do you feel too at home in the office?
Putting on a jogging and slippers is comfortable at home but they are not suitable in the office!
Do not wear a comfortable jog even if your function allows it!
Do not be neglected, respect your colleagues and yourself by dressing properly, and if your function requires it by wearing pretty and elegant clothes, to go to work!
If you want to meet expectations, you are no longer interesting
Slowly move into the usual morning stopper.
Suddenly, a special melody is heard on the radio: the voice of a violin with which electronic effects are associated.
I'll turn it up.
The music changes rhythm and the bass arrives to accompany the tones of all the time, then a female choir comes to join it like a real jewel.
Mr2 airs the song "Wings of Love" by Zagar.
Hungarian musical life has not spoiled us for a long time with good quality electronic pop.
But now it seems that the cork becomes different if you listen to Zagar's new album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, the few interesting new productions born from the Hungarian digital underground gradually begin to change the overall picture and, despite the new fashion of garage rock tearing the guitar, Hungarian electropop proves that there is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer came from Pécs and he himself played in Yonderboi's group before he set out on his own path, perhaps because "there is no room for two feet in the same shoe".
His project (Zagar) and his music, an alloy of jazz, electronic dance music and pop, began to become known when he was entrusted with the composition of the filmed soundtracks (e.g.
The season of Ferenc T<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>k).
The band playing at the beginning in small clubs began to be known by a larger audience when the wan2 magazine cited their first album of 2002 among the fifty most important records in the Hungarian market and proclaimed Zagar, with Yonderboi, the almost the only creators of the Hungarian trend that would also be competitive in the West.
Zagar and his ensemble have become unquestionably “trendy” but no one asked them if they wanted to wear this label.
The band reacted well, it released a new and better record.
The album entitled Cannot Walk Fly Instead, released recently, may open new paths for them, although the title wishes to represent a continuity with the years spent in Pécs.
It was a line from Balázs Zságer's old group of Pécs.
We are there with the reference to the flight but next to the aerial music appears now, following the spirit and trend of the time, the stronger guitar, impact of rock and roll.
Gy<0xC3><0xB6>rgy Ligeti, a singer currently working in England with the group The Puzzle, showed his talent in these songs during the album's premiere at the Millennium Park.
On the album, we find a real hit for the radio, mr2 Pet<0xC3><0xB5>fi, recently broadcasting popular music from morning to night, began to introduce the melodies of Wings of Love recorded with six Hungarian singers ("Underground Divas").
All is well (?).
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer questions.
hvg.hu: This new tube makes me ask a question: has your music remained a music aimed at a certain layer?
Zságer Balázs: The term music aimed at a certain layer doesn’t tell me much.
For me there are two castes in light music; not mainstream or underground, not alternative or pop but commercial music and sincere music.
The so-called alternative, underground music can also be mediocre and made only to sell them and thus become commercial.
But a good pop song can be sincere too.
The attitude of reception works in this spirit also regardless of language or borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference between the Hungarian and foreign audience, is one or the other more open to your music?
Zs.B.: Abroad, especially in the West, light music has older traditions.
There, people go to concerts and not only young people of about ten or twenty years old but also the oldest.
They follow with much more attention the changes that have occurred in light music because they think that it is also part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the public in your work?
Are you interested in knowing who, or how many people listen to your music?
Zs.B.: I am obviously glad to see that more and more people are coming to our concerts.
However, we never made music for the market.
For us, music is not made to achieve a goal but for a specific reason.
The role of the audience is more important at concerts or the mutual influence already works but it is perceived only in the elusive changes of the moment.
Now, I've noticed that if you want to meet the public's expectations, you won't be interesting anymore.
hvg.hu: Are you going to follow Yonderboi’s example?
He works alone and has a career in the west.
Zs.B.: We don’t really follow his path even if sometimes some try to find traces in our music.
Rather, we are team players who trust each other’s musical presence and let it unfold.
In the beginning, it was of course inevitable that our music be compared to that of Yonderboi because we are many to leave his group and take another path.
hvg.hu: On mr2 Pet<0xC3><0xB5>fi’s list, Wings of Love takes first place.
Many people heard Zagar's name for the first time through this song.
With this more popular style you have consciously opened to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We didn't plan to make a tube in order to sell the record.
This song means more.
We wanted it for the finale of the album to try to soften the orgy of sounds and the more difficult themes addressed throughout the record.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why they - what was the guideline?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a gospel choir.
We had the idea to compose this choir of good soloists of the Hungarian music scene.
Thus was composed the six-member choir, namely Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enik<0xC3><0xB5> Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh, which was later baptized Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you want this song like that or did the girls change it a little bit?
Zs.B.: This song was already there for a long time in an instrumental version and then when we wrote the album, we thought that there was still something missing from this song.
The string of chords attracted the voice of the song.
I sang the same night the melody that the girls later learned.
I got it almost right away and everything was terribly spontaneous.
I remember it galvanized me at the time but of course we needed the Divas.
With my voice she wouldn't have had the same strength.
hvg.hu: On the record and at the concert also it seemed to me that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo (with the exception of a short solo by Judy Jay), they do not have a solo role, they all sing together and they do not sing louder than the music, so the music does not just accompany their singing.
They were behind the scene, too.
Is that what you want?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were in the background is due solely to technical problems.
On the other hand, what was voluntary was that we did not want to distribute soloist roles.
The song also says that we have to forget a little bit our ego, forget who comes from where, who goes or, we just have to let these wings, the wings of love, take us away.
I wanted others to also feel that euphoric state that we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which of the songs made you work the most?
Zs.B.: To tell the truth, none of the music creation process, we had more difficult songs during the mixing.
For example, with Dorian Gray's Dilemma, or I play a concert piano, or with Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, or the groove didn't want to work for a long time, and then, little by little, everything came together like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: Which is your favorite on the new album?
Zs.B.: It changes all the time with the concerts and the fact that I have already "released" this record.
These are Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The perfidious trader has risked billions because of his inferiority complex
A cover-up fraudster.
This is how the French giant Société Générale, owner of the Czech bank Komer<0xC4><0x8D>n<0xC3><0xAD> banka, describes its former employee.
The bank lost almost five billion euros because of him.
But it seems rather that Kerviel is only a great player who wanted to match his colleagues, and who, in addition, can not be considered incapable.
Unlike all the major banking houses, he recognized in time the crisis of the American mortgage market.
"He is fragile," his superiors told police.
However, if we stick to Kerviel's testimony reported by the French media, including Le Monde, this man's transactions at the end of last year produced a profit of 1.6 billion euros.
The Crisis Exceeds the United States
“All I wanted was to make money for my bank,” he said in the statement.
Last summer, he managed to take advantage of the US crisis to earn half a billion euros.
In fact, he felt the opportunity from the beginning of the year.
Reports began to emerge in February that so-called “sub-prime” mortgages, granted to low-income customers or those who had experienced repayment difficulties in the past, would have problems.
But this crisis should not affect the economy as a whole.
Kerviel did not believe it and he bet well.
Thus, at the end of the year, its profits amounted to 1.6 billion euros.
“As soon as I won my first half-billion, I didn’t know how to announce it,” Kerviel confides, adding that he has, of course, kept nothing to himself.
Throughout the interrogation, he confessed to having falsified the reports so as not to be tracked down.
He managed to fool his superiors, although the Eurex stock exchange began to take an interest in his transactions.
Who risks nothing has nothing.
Was he afraid of being found out?
I don't think so.
"I estimated that just getting $1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them."
Where does his willingness to take such a big risk come from?
He only came to his post gradually.
He started working at Société Générale in 2000 just after finishing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was around $51,000.
Two years later, he was already an assistant trader and, in 2005, he became an independent trader with an annual salary of 90 thousand dollars.
He knew he would never earn as much as anyone else.
"From my first interview in 2005, I knew that I was much less considered than the others.
With regard to my university course and my professional and personal career," Kerviel told investigators.
Shortly after taking office, he achieved his first major success.
Thanks to the Allianz shares, he won half a billion euros by betting on the decline of this title during the attacks in London.
And the mechanism was triggered - he wanted more.
As long as you win, we leave you in peace
“It was like a snowball effect,” he told police.
But the superiors were aware of everything, or rather, they suspected it.
“As long as I was winning, they were pretending to close their eyes.”
This is where the start of the year comes in.
They lose a billion dollars in one day.
In mid-January, after the weekend, he decided to hide the amount.
On Monday, when he arrives at work, he is no longer employed by the bank.
A few days later, the bank announced that it had lost 5 billion euros because of him.
And how did we find out?
He became a suspect because of his leave of absence.
"Last year, I only took four days off.
A trader who doesn’t take a vacation is a trader who doesn’t want to leave his book to someone else,” Kerviel concludes.
The Czech Republic has the opportunity to obtain 365 billion
Yesterday, ministers of the Czech government signed a total of nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, which could, in the coming years, bring 14 billion euros (about 365 billion Czech crowns) to the Czech Republic.
This is about half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can get from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Almost 125 billion kroner from seven operational programmes will go to the Czech regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain around 100 billion crowns under the Enterprise and Innovation programme.
The transport sector will benefit the most, up to 150 billion.
The Transport programme is the largest operational programme and represents up to 22 per cent of the financial resources that the Czech Republic can obtain under these projects.
This money will lead to an increase in the budget of the National Transport Infrastructure Fund which will manage next year a sum of 90.8 billion crowns.
The Enterprise and Innovation programme, aimed at SMEs and entrepreneurs, should be used to obtain financial resources to encourage innovation within the company.
Companies should obtain financial means for the introduction of new technologies, research in industry, but also for the introduction of new and more efficient management methods.
Until now, the Czech Republic has been one of the least successful recipients of EU funds among the new members.
The Court confirmed the sentence of 20 years in prison for the former president of Nicaragua
The Nicaraguan Court of Appeal on Thursday upheld a 20-year prison sentence for former Nicaraguan President Arnold Alemán, who was sentenced in 2003 for a $100 million (nearly 1.8 billion crowns) fraud.
However, he was later released and was under house arrest in his hacienda near the Nicaraguan capital.
Whether or not the former head of the Central American state, in office between 1997 and 2002, will be incarcerated again is not clear at the moment, according to the AP agency.
According to the president of the Court of Appeal Ileana Pérez, everything will now depend on the prison agents, either they will let Aleman finish his sentence at home, or else he will go back to prison.
Four years ago, the Tribunal proved that Alemán regularly moved government money to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These were fictitious companies and the accounts actually belonged to his family members and his closest supporters.
Some of this money went into the funds that Alemán had created to finance his election campaign in 2001.
The budget was adopted
That's the way it is.
The state budget was adopted.
How is this budget exceptional?
This is the first budget designed by this government and accepted by the government majority without the support of the opposition.
The one for the current year passed a year ago thanks to the support of the Czech Socialist Party - <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, since it was Minister Sobotka who had prepared it and <0xC4><0x8C>SSD could not afford its refusal.
Unlike the heated debate before the vote on the declaration of no confidence in the government, this time, nothing dramatic.
The Chamber of Deputies passed this law without any problem, which, although the most influential, is usually neglected.
This is a kind of paradox.
Whether we like it or not, every chapter and every article is the beginning and the end of every government.
The budget is a constituent part of politics, although hidden behind the power competition between government and opposition.
The latter is more attractive in the media and that is why it is given more attention in the media.
The disputes of politicians are much more interesting to the opinion than the abrupt figures.
The national budgets of past socialist governments suffered from three evils which the present budget is not able to deal with at the same time:
The first is the large share given to the statutory mandate costs, consisting not only of pensions but also of social charges, adopted last year by the silent "coalition" of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and KS<0xC4><0x8C>M parties.
The second is a deficit economy, a consequence of the first evil.
The third obstacle is the deficit of public finances, that is, the deficit of cities and municipalities.
However, it is not the state budget deficit that represents the greatest hazard.
It is public and relatively under control.
The real time bomb is the deficit of cities and communes.
Many mayors often issued dizzy bonds, disproportionately indebting their municipalities, in order to obtain, apart from money from taxes, tax duties and bank credits, new sources of investment.
In past years, they managed to repay these debts through the mass sale of the shares of the distribution systems, especially those of energy, obtained from the State as part of the privatizations.
They no longer have that source.
If we look only at the official and verifiable facts, we find that:
Our economy has already been going through a growth phase for several years, as has the rest of the world, and <0xC4><0x8C>SSD is sure to do so.
It was a unique opportunity for successive governments of this party to regularize public finances.
But instead, they were in debt to the state more and more.
Other countries, with a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania or Egypt, have managed their affairs in a much more reasonable way than our republic.
It is a monstrous shame that falls mainly on previous governments.
We are among the countries that are least threatened by poverty globally.
We therefore have no need for massive social programmes which have unfortunately, in recent years, become unnecessarily inflated.
Although some of the absurd populist spending approved last year before the elections has been eliminated, if a gap in the retirement age limit, as well as a reform of the pension system, does not take place soon, then all politics will cease to exist in this country and whoever is in power will only administer.
By barely exaggerating, it can be said that the politicians in power will become bureaucrats mechanically distributing the majority of the imposed money between pensions and social benefits.
This is the reason why the current budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the mechanism that causes ordinary expenses to be postponed by the expenses of mandates.
The $70 billion deficit projected for 2008 would be absolutely unnecessary if previous governments had not dissipated as much money as they could.
If we really do not want the politicians in power to become mere bureaucrats, we must be patient and give this fragile government coalition, aware that the state can only spend the equivalent of what it manages to levy in taxes and tax duties, the calm necessary to prepare new reform laws.
Only the latter will make it possible to gradually achieve a balanced state budget.

The banks want to solve the crisis.
The Federal Reserve Bank of the United States, the European Central Bank and the central banks of the United Kingdom, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight the financial market crisis together.
More than one hundred billion dollars will thus be placed on the money markets through auctions.
It will involve banks selling, through an auction system, the interest rates at which they are ready to borrow money.
For example, the U.S. Fed will auction off $40 billion and, in addition, it will provide $24 billion to the European and Swiss central banks.
This is the first time since the attacks of 11 September that the central banks of individual states have decided to take such concerted action to prevent or even reduce the effects of the financial crisis.
"This approach tends to solve the major problems of the economy, namely the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend," writes in his report to clients Bernard Baumohl of the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group.
“The concerted action of central banks has lowered the probability of a recession in the United States from 65 percent to about 50 percent,” Baumohl said.
Banks have already lost $60 billion to unrepayable loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts are still expecting more losses in the billions.
"If central banks have chosen this approach, it is because they have to really understand what can still follow," said ABN chief economist Amro Kieran Davies.
“I think the situation is really bad,” he added.
Central banks fear that if the banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will lend more to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the U.S. economy into a recession that could affect economic growth around the world.
The central banks made this choice after the failure to lower the London interbank rate, called LIBOR, used to borrow on the interbank market.
This meant that banks still feared mutual borrowing, despite the fact that the US, Canadian and British central banks repeatedly lowered their interest rates in the fall.
"It will have the same effect as a further drop in interest rates," Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts do not believe that the approach of the central banks will not help to stave off the crisis, since it does not solve the main problem that is the fall of the real estate market in the US.
President Klaus: the debates of environmentalists are incredible
Global climate change is expected to be particularly damaging to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus has once again spoken out on the issue of global warming.
The criticism this time has fallen on the United Nations international conference on climate change ending in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The Blue Planet, not Green, he stated that the debates of environmentalists were incredible.
According to Klaus, it is not only the structure of the conference, made up of a curious mix of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, that is unacceptable, but also the basic difference between the rhetoric that accompanies it and the reality.
“The debate is not structured at all, it’s just a rocket of words, ersatz solutions to current problems,” Klaus said.
During the presentation of his book, the Czech President stressed that his topic is of great importance to him and that is why he is so committed to this cause.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book also appeared in German translation, since, he said, "I often only encounter the caricature of my opinions".
From now on, interested persons can read his positions without them being distorted.
Klaus recalled that although he is not a climatologist, he nevertheless has, in his opinion, enough dispositions to write such a book.
He is indeed an academician capable of following and appreciating scientific treatises, he has the practice of statistics and he is also an economist.
The major conclusions of the book are, according to him, the following theses: the climate is constantly changing, the changes in it are therefore normal, there is not a shared opinion by all researchers on global warming, the effects of current changes are not too important or too serious, they therefore represent no unnecessary danger and, finally, the efforts carried out to influence the evolution of the climate are ineffective.
Especially since he has experience of a totalitarian regime, he considers it unacceptable to impose unverified opinions on others, which he feels is a dangerous attack on freedom.
In response to questions from those present, he repeatedly explained that he was not against "reasonable protection of the environment, but against a fundamentalist environmentalism that does not take into account the relationship between costs and the profit they bring".
In Vienna, Klaus had already talked about this subject two months ago, at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 people failed to renew their driver’s license in time
Six hundred thousand drivers allowed the deadline to expire and failed to renew their old driver's license, which expires at the end of the year.
We are the last day that people can still apply for renewal, so that the authorities are in a position to issue them a new licence before the end of the year.
However, the Department is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of unlicensed drivers will be on the road.
According to the authorities, they have not renewed their driving license, especially those who no longer wish to drive.
While municipalities report a drop in the number of licence renewal applications, the authorities in the capital are flooded with applications and the number of licence renewal applications has been increasing this week.
The City Hall satisfies about 2000 customers per day.
There's a line about half an hour long.
In Prague, nearly 140.OOO drivers have not yet renewed their driving licenses.
The issuance of a new permit takes 20 days.
But it is possible to apply for the grant within a short period of five days.
In this case, the driver pays an additional five hundred crowns.
Drivers who fail to renew their driver's license by the end of the year and drive without a valid license will face a fine as early as January.
The culprit will be forced to pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
However, the police officer may also deal with the offence using an amicable approach.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine rises to 2,500 kroner.
According to old information, even a person who was not going to circulate was liable to a fine.
In doing so she could be forced to pay up to 30,000 kroner.
The Ministry had called on the authorities to moderate and impose fines not exceeding 1000 kroner.
However, according to Ministry of Transport spokesman Karel Hanzelka, no one risks fines in the tens of thousands.
The driver's license is a document that people can decide whether they want to have or not.
It is not like with the identity card, which must be valid without exceptions.
People who no longer wish to drive should surrender their driver’s license.
It is enough to bring it or send it to the corresponding municipality.
Driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid at the end of the year.
However, drivers are also forced to gradually renew other types of driving licences.
Individuals with documents from 1994 to 2000 have three years to complete the renewal.
The validity of driving licences issued in the years 2001 to 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is about 2.6 million other documents.
The Court has reduced the sentences of the detectives agreed with Berdych
Josef Opava and Petr Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k, former police officers accused of colluding with David Berdych’s gang, will serve 13 and 10 years in prison respectively.
The Prague High Court has thus definitively condemned them by reducing their sentences by 1 and 2 years respectively.
Initially, detectives in the Department for Combating Organized Crime faced 14 and 12 years in prison.
It is no longer possible to appeal against today's judgment, only an appeal to the High Court is possible.
Although Berdych is also charged in this case, he is currently awaiting a trial verdict.
However, he has already been sentenced to more than 16 years in prison in other trials.
He cannot receive more.
In January, the District Court found 19 people guilty of participating in heists, and the High Court is now processing appeals from 16 of them.
Since the beginning of the investigation, most of the defendants have questioned the accusation, claiming that it was a manipulated case.
According to the Central Bohemian Court of Justice, members of the police, after an agreement among others with Berdych, transmitted information from police sources to criminals, covered the various heists and helped gang members avoid criminal liability.
The gang remitted 30 percent of the larceny to Opava and Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k.
The prosecution is concerned with the criminal activity of the gang in the years 1999 to 2001.
These are essentially armed robberies, the victims of which have, in most cases, suffered serious damage to their health, but also abuse of power by a public official and prohibited weaponry.
During the house searches, the police discovered illegally held pistols, shells with a steel core, a sight for direct laser fire or a submachine gun.
According to the charges, the gang has enriched itself with tens of millions of crowns.
Aside from about 20 men in the trial, the courts have already found Berdych and a host of others guilty of other robberies.
Other men from Berdych's neighborhood are still explaining themselves in court in another trial, some cases have not yet reached the court.
The main hearing avoided, for the time being, Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> P<0xC5><0xAF>ta and Maro<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0xA0>ulej who are currently in detention in Ireland, where they are awaiting a final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic.
The price of child substitution: 12 million
The lawyer for the affected families, Igor Veleba, is seeking compensation of 12 million kroner plus costs from the T<0xC5><0x99>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D> hospital.
Three million for each of the mothers, two million for the fathers and one million for each of the children.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
That is why the lawyer of the Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Dostál hospital absolutely does not agree with Veleba's proposal.
“We reject such a claim, it is very, very high,” Dostál said at the end of the hearing.
"In order to be able to form an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need the expert report which the opposing party has commissioned to be drawn up.
We will check if it has any explanatory value.
But we continue to think that the total sum should not exceed hundreds of thousands," Dostál stressed.
The amount should be set at between K<0xC4><0x8D> 100,000 and K<0xC4><0x8D> 200,000 for each of the four parents, he said.
At the beginning of the affair, Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov's family demanded one million crowns for each month they could not raise their biological daughter.
Veleba used the expert report, prepared for him by the University Hospital in Prague-Motol, as a supporting document for the compensation negotiations.
According to experts in psychology and psychiatry, parents suffered psychological damage and were subject to stress at different scales and depths.
The stress situation was better endured by the men, although they were faced with the remorse of not having been able to prevent the substitution of newborns.
Women, however, remain less serene in the face of the experience of trauma in the news and in the face of what is happening right now, summarized the content of the Veleba report.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses at the T<0xC5><0x99>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D> hospital on 9 December.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the <0xC4><0x8C>ermák in P<0xC5><0x99>ibyslavice and Veronika to Libor Bro<0xC5><0xBE> and Jaroslava Trojanová in Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov.
At the end of October, the governor of the region Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Vystr<0xC4><0x8D>il gave each of the families 100,000 kroner for the reimbursement of expenses caused by the error of the T<0xC5><0x99>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D> hospital managed by the region.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally obliged to provide liability insurance.
In case of default, they must draw from the reserve fund, exceptionally, they can ask for help from the manager.
Until now, the courts recognized relatively low compensation, the sums calculated according to the tables were in the hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka lost Vala<0xC5><0xA1>ské Královstv<0xC3><0xAD> (the Kingdom of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko)
Bolek Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka lost the dispute over the trademark Vala<0xC5><0xA1>ské královstv<0xC3><0xAD> (Kingdom of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko).
According to the judge of the Ostrava Regional Court, he had indeed used the title King of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko for the first time, but the project was set up by the team around Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, a former collaborator of the actor.
Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka was not present at today's hearing.
However, according to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and his client will appeal.
"The dispute concerns the fact that Mr. Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team are interfering with the popularity of Bolek Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka," Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka's lawyer said after the trial.
According to him, the words Kingdom of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko evoke to everyone precisely this actor and comedian.
Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> is of the same opinion.
“There is a work of almost ten years behind us.
The search for money and the development of events," he said.
According to him, it is the money that is the cause of the dispute.
"After years, they realized that the project is successful and that they could benefit from it.
They are the ones who want to parasitize our work," he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, it was Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka who first used the title vala<0xC5><0xA1>sk<0xC3><0xBD> král (King of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko) in his television show.
Actor Radoslav Brzobohat<0xC3><0xBD> had crowned him king in 1993.
However, at the time, this had nothing to do with the project of setting up a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> came up with the idea of issuing passports from Vala<0xC5><0xA1>ské Královstv<0xC3><0xAD>.
From a humorous action originally emerged a lucrative business and commercial activity, followed by the creation, by Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, of the company Vala<0xC5><0xA1>ské královstv<0xC3><0xAD>.
In 1997 Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka accepted that his name and signature be mentioned in the passport and he even offered the holders balances on the price of the visit to his farm and his theater shows.
Who will sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> only used the naked idea, published by Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka in the show mané<0xC5><0xBE>, for commercial purposes.
"The popularity of Boleslav Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka certainly helped the Vala<0xC5><0xA1>ské královstv<0xC3><0xAD> project," the judge said.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team, who devoted themselves intensely to the project.
Collaboration between the now-enemy parties continued until 2000 when Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> organised an official coronation for Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka in Vset<0xC3><0xAD>n.
But from there, conflicts began to accumulate between Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka and Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, which culminated in the deposition of "King Boleslav I elected forever".
The leading role in the kingdom was then, under the inspiration of Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, assumed by the singer Jarmila <0xC5><0xA0>uláková as Queen Mother.
Then, in 2002, Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka filed a complaint against Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his company, which the court today rejected.
What could make the case clear is the tournament envisaged for the throne and half of the princess.
There should be a new king.
He didn’t want to betray the details and the date yet.
“We don’t want to go fast.
It would be something like the parade of kings in Slovácko.
The king would be elected for a time.
Even Mr. Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka can of course register," Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> added.
Test of the Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: disappearance of prejudices
I’ve never been a big fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its rolling qualities were nothing extraordinary, the quality of the change of speed, of the driving and also that of the manufacture could, in many respects, be described as inferior to the average.
However, there is currently on the market its successor the Peugeot 207 which is much better.
Especially since the combo named SW goes a step further, I just have to think better.
When I was testing the classic hatchback of the Peugeot 207 I was complaining about the headroom on the rear seats, for example.
While there end the complaints because the body combi means that even the great devils will be, in this regard, comfortable.
Let's see quickly done
I'm going to talk about the inside very quickly so I don't repeat myself too much.
This is an almost successful design, my only remark about the central tunnel that seems to me poor.
There, I would have liked a slightly more inventive design, given that the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and the days when you could complain about seats or backs that were too short are over.
The lateral guidance has also improved markedly compared to the model 206.
As for the space, the increase in the dimensions of the bodywork is noticeable here too.
The combi also disappears the lack of space above the head already mentioned.
A trunk in the trunk
The most important thing about this vehicle is its luggage compartment.
I have to evaluate this one as very well accessible (also thanks to the rear pivoting glass) and a rather easy docking.
Blind spaces are equipped with stop elastics which are an ideal compromise.
It is not bulky and can be extended while being able to hold quite heavy objects.
But let’s stop with the volume.
This is, according to the tables, 428 l in the basic configuration, which is a rather average figure compared to the competition.
Apart from the <0xC5><0xA0>koda Fabia Combi, the best-selling vehicle in this category in the Czech Republic.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the Mlada Boleslav product, we find that the Peugeot remains very significantly behind, the difference being 52 liters.
When it comes to going on holidays abroad or loading a stroller, this figure is almost critical.
But, if I had to point out the advantages, I would mention the underbody remaining after the backrests of the rear seats perfectly straight, or a very low step.
120 horsepower on four cylinders
The car we tested was equipped with a four-cylinder Otto engine with a volume of 1.6 l and an output of 88 kW.
And to tell the truth, that's what a 1.6 should look like that makes a family hatchback work.
It is silent, consumes little and, above all, grows well.
If I compare it with the equivalent produced by <0xC5><0xA0>koda which often gives the impression of having an exhaust pipe clogged by a mop, then I can only be enthusiastic about it.
Let's go through the rates
The price of the vehicle is not affordable by everyone.
However, we must be aware that we tested a fairly well equipped car, with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a vehicle with a 1.4-litre Otto engine amounting to 329,900 K<0xC4><0x8D> is still fair.
The vehicle we tested costs from 410 900 K<0xC4><0x8D>, which is already enough.
Premium equipment, also tested, increases the price by 80,000 K<0xC4><0x8D>.
However, in addition to head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic wipers, automatic control of the rear windows...
In reality, the vehicle ultimately costs 531 900 K<0xC4><0x8D>.
This is a lot, but try to add to the price of the Fabia additional equipment and you will get a very similar figure.
All that remains is to choose the brand.
Integration of Slovak pupils into British schools is bad
The number of children from Eastern European countries in British schools is growing, raising concerns among the remaining children about the development of local education.
The integration of Eastern Europeans is currently facing a series of obstacles.
British schools are even seeing cases where conflicts between immigrants and descendants of the original inhabitants turn into violence.
The case of North Kent, where the conflicts between immigrants of Slovak origin and those of Slovak origin are beginning to increase, illustrates the problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe.
The disputes, the chicane and the fights between the students have been transposed into the relations between the parents.
The situation went so far that police arrested a Slovak woman in Chatham who was beating a ten-year-old student with an iron bar.
She defended herself by saying that the boy had insulted her with racist remarks.
Police also had to intervene following the attack on a Slovak immigrant by two teenage girls.
The girls allegedly made racist remarks to the man and threw stones at him.
“As we were coming home, a young man climbed up on the bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to stop, he answered with apples and pears and then he discovered his buttocks," described another unpleasant adventure a mother of Slovak pupils.
Complaints are made by both parties.
One of the survivors went so far as to describe the conflicts with immigrants as a struggle for survival.
The cases mentioned above show that the atmosphere in British schools between the inhabitants of origin and immigrants is beginning to be tense.
Seventy thousand Slovaks who came to find work were registered in Great Britain.
And about 30 thousand Slovak pupils attend British schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is truly an island of freedom.
Everything you expect from your holidays can come true if you make a good choice.
Golden and white beaches like snow, high waves or a calm sea like a pond.
Palm trees and all inclusive with waiters offering you on the beach a pizza, ice cream or intoxicating cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean Sea, you will not find this list only in its entirety, but enriched.
However, there is only one island on which you will find much more and that is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island in the Greater Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba had been the bastion of their invasion of America.
Christopher Columbus called it the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became the depot and place of transshipment of the treasures that the Spaniards had stolen and that they were transporting to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was built at the beginning of the 20's.
It was Lucky Luciano, one of the leaders of the American mafia, who had it built, since everything that was a crime in the US (especially under prohibition) was admitted and supported in Cuba: drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his clients were, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rise buildings grew and cars, belonging to the cult symbols of the 50's of the last century, circulated on the wide boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and, in Coj<0xC3><0xAD>mar, he had his yacht.
The stars of show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
So, what about today?
You can leave your autograph on the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana.
In the bar of the Hotel Nacional, a luxury hotel, you will mix the cocktail of your choice.
And these cult cars still circulate in Havana, since jigoulis and fiats once imported have already long ago, in a climate so salty and humid, rotten.
Although Havana, especially the oldest part, is noticeably decrepit, nowhere else in the vicinity are there as many splendid colonial monuments as there are precisely there.
Other places become more beautiful, for example Trinidad.
Since tourism brings the money if necessary, its development has the green light.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana, but especially in Varader, on the coast of Holgu<0xC3><0xAD>n province, and also on small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a fantasy that is unique in the world and that will be appreciated especially by lovers of small trains.
The cane had come back from the plantations extended in the sugar mills on a narrow track by small steam and motor trains.
Their rolling stock has not been renewed for decades and this is how we can see small locomotives running, whose contemporaries are not elsewhere only in museums.
Where to direct your steps?
The majority of visitors do not miss the most famous places.
So there is no need to write long about Varadero or Havana.
Otherwise remember that in the property of Hemingway, already mentioned, there is a museum and that the one who loves this writer should not miss the visit.
The Vi<0xC5><0x88>ales Valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
Exuberant vegetation grows there on a limestone soil.
Mogots, limestone balloons, and boulders swoop up from the valley floor, and, with fertile soil in their bowels, even its rotten rocks are covered with a very dense carpet of vegetation.
The valley is probably the place where the best quality Cuban tobacco is grown.
You will be able to meet the final form of this product if you visit one of Havana’s cigar factories.
Someone might also find it interesting that this is where the Chilean episode of Major Zeman was shot.
Trinidad
It was founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
It was the slave trade and the sugar trade that brought him glory and wealth.
The wealth was embodied in the beauty and the city-window character of this small city.
Koloniáln<0xC3><0xAD> <0xC5><0xA1>pan<0xC4><0x9B>lská architektura, v<0xC3><0xBD>razn<0xC4><0x9B> ovlivn<0xC4><0x9B>ná pozd<0xC4><0x9B>j<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD>mi francouzsk<0xC3><0xBD>mi osadn<0xC3><0xAD>ky, formerly <0xC4><0x8D>ty<0xC5><0x99>i stalet<0xC3><0xAD> tém<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99> nezm<0xC4><0x9B>nila.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray mountain range, is a place so remote that even in the 50's of the last century, there was no road that would connect this region with the rest of the country.
This isolation allowed him to remain on the sidelines.
We didn't build anything, and that's why we didn't demolish anything either, everybody just had a roof over their head.
If you have more time in Trinidad than an afternoon, then it is worth going to see also some interesting places in the surroundings, such as Playa Anc<0xC3><0xB3>n beach or the Valley of the Sweets.
Then, in the evening, it is customary to go to the Casa de la M<0xC3><0xBA>sica which comes alive after sunset and where the music only becomes dull in the early morning.
Baracoa
Some refer to this town located in the extreme East of Cuba as the most beautiful on the island.
This opinion is certainly already influenced by the path that leads to it.
The two roads leading there from Guantánamo must cross high, rugged mountains and traverse an almost unmarked landscape of human activity.
UNESCO has inscribed Cuba’s East Cove, thanks to its unspoiled landscape, on the World Heritage List.
The best chocolate is made there, in the church, there is the cross of Christopher Columbus (in reality, it was born about a hundred years after the journey of Columbus) and from the hill where the old castle stands and the current hotel El Castillo, we see several table mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigars, the mountain massif Sierra Maestra, the Bay of sows and the island of Pinos, the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of the patron saint of Cuba Caridad del Cobre, Santeria, African religions practiced by the descendants of former slaves, about all this one could fill a lot of pages.
But, as they say, it’s better to see it once.
In Afghanistan, Allies Are Passive, Says U.S.
According to the United States, the lack of soldiers and necessary equipment affects the progress of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to Defence Minister Robert Gates, NATO should outline a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not proceeding as it should, agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland, representatives of countries that have troops in the southern part of the country.
In addition to growing opposition from the Taliban movement, the eight states involved are now also discussing future plans and the coordination of allies.
While the United States this week, through Defense Minister Robert Gates, called NATO troops to greater activity, Britain has made it a priority to strengthen the authority of the Afghan government and step up development assistance.
“The evolution in Afghanistan is noticeable, but military might can only be part of the solution.
The other is to allow people to start a new development of the economy and security themselves," British Defence Minister Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety Percent
The activity of Afghan insurgents is, according to U.S. military data, the most intense in the last five years.
The number of violent actions increased by 27 per cent compared to last year, to 60 per cent in the southern Helmand province.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, nearly a quarter of them in the southern part.
However, according to the United States, the allies have reached their absolute limit and in the organization and equipment of the troops.
In concrete terms, they are asking for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan troops.
“We will need to think seriously about concrete goals for the period ahead, as well as how to achieve them,” Gates said.
NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop made similar remarks today.
“I’m not happy with what we have on the ground and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we would need, and that's not enough," De Hoop told Reuters at the end of three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is Passive
In recent months, there have also been conflicts between the countries involved over whether all allies are actually doing everything they can in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany has been criticized for its passivity.
"The Germans have a relatively large representation in Afghanistan.
But they are engaged in areas where violence is minimal, so the combat demands they are subject to are not as stringent as those in the southern and eastern parts of the country where we operate,” Gates said.
The British tabloid Sun this week called German soldiers lazy.
"Afghan slackers discovered: Germans play, while ours fight," Sun wrote in a document supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German newspaper Bild went on the counterattack by publishing a photo of a British troupe during a rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
Government Debt to Rise to $1 Trillion in 2009
The burden of a state debt exceeding 84,000 kroner falls on each Czech.
At the end of September, the total debt amounted to 842.7 billion kroner.
The government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion kroner this year.
As a result of better-than-expected changes in the state budget savings, the ministry reduced the planned amount to 152.8 billion kroner.
At the end of September, the debt of the Czech Republic rose to 842.7 billion kroner.
During the nine months of this year it has therefore increased by 40.2 billion kroner.
However, as of June, it has decreased by 13.4 billion kroner.
Today, the Ministry of Finance has confirmed its data on the state debt dating from early October.
The burden of a debt exceeding 84,000 kroner falls on each Czech.
Over the past year, the state has gone into debt of more than 111 billion kroner.
"For now, it seems that, thanks to a smaller deficit planned for next year, we could exceed the border of one trillion crowns only in 2009.
Next year, the debt should be between 900 billion and one trillion crowns," Patria Finance analyst David Marek told the iHNed.cz server.
The forecast of Next Finance analyst Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Pikor is similar: "We could exceed the trillion in the course of 2009.
The exact date will depend on the next budget that we do not know yet.
If it appeared that the political situation was changing, that policies were ready to save more, the date could be pushed back to 2010.
But I am not waiting for this change," he said.
Debts are growing
The state debt is constituted by central government debts and it is generated essentially by the accumulation of deficits in the state budget.
The government debt is financed by treasury bills, annuities, direct loans or, for example, by loans to the European Investment Bank.
The domestic debt of the state has increased this year for the moment from 38,5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns.
The foreign debt of the state has increased this year for the moment from 1.7 billion kroner to 123.3 billion kroner.
The so-called negotiable state debt reached 803.3 billion kroner at the end of September and as of June it has decreased by 13.7 billion kroner.
The average debt requirement of the State was 6.5 years.
“Total debt increased year-on-year from the first to the third half of the year by 13 percent, which is, given the current good health of the economy, a much too high figure.
It is interesting that the increase is generated mainly by the annuity securities where it reaches 20 percent.
It is bad that the debt is growing, but on the other hand it indicates that there will be something to negotiate when the pension reform comes," Pikora said.
Better than we expected
It follows from the government's debt financing and management strategy for 2007 that the government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion kroner this year.
However, at the beginning of September, thanks to a better-than-expected evolution of the savings of the state budget, the ministry reduced the planned amount to 152.8 billion crowns.
The sum is essentially constituted by the deficit of the budget of the State that will obviously reach 76 billion crowns this year, instead of the 91,3 billion crowns initially previewed.
Secondly, these are the maximum sources planned for the Czech Consolidation Agency, i.e. CZK 13.3 billion, the reserve of CZK 10 billion for the payment of pensions, the financing of government annuities for CZK 43 billion and the repayments of loans from the European Investment Bank amounting to CZK 1.8 billion.
She was appearing in court in Khartoum today for naming a teddy bear
The British teacher tried in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced Thursday night by a court in Khartoum to 15 days in prison and expulsion, said her lawyer.
The British woman was accused of allowing students aged 6 to 7 to give the name of Muhammad to a teddy bear while any representation of the prophet of Islam is illegal.
She was liable to a penalty of lashing.
The 54-year-old British teacher, who works at Unity High School in Khartoum, Sudan, was arrested on Sunday at her home and charged with Islam and sedition under Article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, following several complaints by parents of students to the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story actually dates back to September, when this teacher asked her students, aged 6/7, to choose a name for the class’s teddy bear.
“Eight names come out of the mouths of children, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed,” said school principal Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a vote in the class, 20 out of 23 children chose Mohamed as their preferred first name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
The children then made a book for the class with the picture of the bear followed by the caption “My name is Mohamed”.
The bear itself was not labeled with this name, but the problem is simply that of the depiction of the prophet being considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gibbons’ Muslim colleagues, a teacher at the same school in Sudan, said he knew Gibbons well and that she would never have done anything that would be insulting to a religious faith, “I just regret that she asked the children to vote for a name,” he said, calling it an “innocent mistake.”
The opinion was shared by many of the teacher's students, who described her as "very caring towards her students" and "who never talks about religion in class".
Remember that the first name Mohamed is also the second most given name in Great Britain, it is written in English in 14 different ways.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
For example, can you give it to a toy?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
They did not reach an agreement on the future status of the province on Wednesday, during the last session of negotiations in Vienna.
In the end, failure.
Kosovo Serbs and Kosovo Albanians wrapped up a sixth and final session of talks in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning without overcoming their differences over the future status of the breakaway province.
"It is regrettable that the parties were not able to reach an agreement on the status," European Ombudsman Wolfgang Ischinger told a news conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was “at stake,” his US counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to abide by their commitments to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of negotiations.
“We don’t foresee violence in the immediate future, but we are entering a very difficult period,” he added, noting that “obvious tensions exist.”
End of mediation on December 10
The mediators of the troika, which includes the European Union, the United States and Russia, will visit Serbia and Kosovo for the last time on Monday.
The future of the 90 percent Albanian-speaking province could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by Dec. 10.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and final session of negotiations since the troika was tasked with a new UN mediation last August.
The United States and the European Union expect their mediation to end on December 10.
The Russians, who have already blocked the granting of independence to Kosovo in the Security Council, insist on continuing negotiations beyond that deadline.
“Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution,” Botsane-Khartchenko said.
Unilateral Declaration of Independence?
After eight years of UN administration in Kosovo, Westerners believe that independence under EU supervision is the only viable solution.
Pristina stands ready to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council does not decide in its favour.
Belgrade insists on greater autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached," Kosovo's autonomous authority president Fatmir Sejdiu said at the Baden hotel where the "last-chance negotiations" had been taking place since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future prime minister of the province, expressed his regret.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade “belonged to a past that led to murders and deportations.”
"The Domino Effect"
Serbian President Boris Tadic said a compromise was still possible, warning Kosovo's Albanian majority against the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence.
Belgrade says it fears a "domino effect" in a region still weakened by the wars of independence of the 1990s.
“For Serbia,” he said, “this does not mean that a compromise is impossible.”
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision should come exclusively to the Security Council, where its Russian ally has a veto.
“The Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word”
“Only a solution in the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia,” Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
“These negotiations lasted two years.
They must end as they began: in the Security Council.”
Fatmir Sedjiu told reporters that “the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the status,” adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by Albanian speakers would be made “in consultation” with Westerners.
Bush pulls off a deal between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced at the opening of the international peace conference he convened Tuesday in Annapolis, Maryland, that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint statement.
He said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately enter into negotiations with a view to finding a final settlement to the 60-year-old dispute between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must dismantle “terrorist infrastructure” and Israel must end its settlement activities, Bush said, reminding both sides of their obligations under the “road map” for peace they accepted in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would aim "to conclude a peace treaty resolving all outstanding issues, without exception, including central issues."
This name covers the three thorny issues at the heart of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees driven from their homes in what is now the State of Israel during the 1948 conflict.
Speaking after the US president, Abbas insisted that the upcoming negotiations be “global and thorough” and cover all aspects of a settlement, citing “Jerusalem, refugees, borders, settlements, water, security, among others.”
In turn, Olmert pledged that the upcoming talks would be "direct and continuous" and make "an effort to close them in the course of 2008".
Bush set a deadline at the end of 2008 for the implementation of his Palestinian and Israeli "vision of two states" that coexist.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had obtained a commitment in this direction from Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is behind a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, that offers Israel peace in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it addresses the roots of the conflict and its central aspects," Prince Saud said in his interview with the Saudi-owned Arabic-language daily.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always in this type of miscellaneous fact, official versions and rumors oppose each other.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation of the General Inspectorate of the National Police (IGPN), a police car was circulating on Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m., rue Louise-Michel, in Villiers-le-Bel.
“She was not on duty but on patrol, and was driving at 40-50 km/h, without a beacon,” a police source explains.
A green motorcycle of the brand Kawazaki, "not approved, therefore not allowed to circulate on the public road" (read below) and driven by two young people without helmets, was circulating "at a very fast pace".
“She hit the police car on her left, after a refusal of priority on the right,” said a police officer.
The blood-alcohol test carried out on the vehicle occupants was negative.
The condition of the car (front smashed, starry windshield, ripped bumper) testifies to the violence of the shock.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thér<0xC3><0xA8>re de Givry, announced that she had entrusted an investigation for "facts of involuntary homicide and non-assistance to anyone in danger" to the IGPN, cosaisie with the departmental direction of public security of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, during a press conference, the prosecutor said that the investigation of the IGPN, at this stage, dismissed the responsibility of the police.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, heard Sunday night, confirmed "the version of the police, namely that this mini-motorcycle arrived relatively quickly on their left".
Yesterday, a kind of groove, probably caused by the friction of the foot pegs on the ground, showed that the two vehicles remained entangled until the police car managed to brake.
The vehicles have been seized and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of the two victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened right after that?
Yesterday, a rumor quickly circulated in Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the police officers would have left the place very quickly, thus not helping the two young people.
The IGPN, while remaining cautious, would also rule out “serious misconduct” on this point.
"This is a more difficult aspect of the investigation, which requires more investigation, on which we must be very careful," said a police source.
Liberation met an eyewitness from those few moments following the accident.
One of his windows overlooking the scene.
“We immediately went down, with my cousin who is a nurse in the hospital, to try to revive them,” says this witness.
There was nothing to do."
He then saw “a completely haggard policeman, who was limping.
Two others were trying to resuscitate one of the young people, the fourth was talking on the phone.”
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and, it seems, with the certainty that the people present had the unexpected situation of the young people, the police were taken by car by colleagues who arrived at the scene.
According to the witness, the rescuers arrived “about twenty minutes after the police left.”
They also practiced cardiac massages, to no avail.
“I will not say that the police did not provide assistance to young people.
These young people were rescued.
The firefighters arrived immediately.
Every effort has been made to try to save them,” the prosecutor said.
Tensions rise in Pakistan
Pakistani police on Monday cracked down on the first protests since the imposition of a state of emergency two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the eastern city of Lahore, about 2,000 lawyers protesting against emergency measures were injured by tear gas canisters used by security forces, witnesses said.
The latter retaliated by throwing stones, injuring police officers.
At least 350 lawyers have been arrested.
Similar scenarios in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police officers charged and injured lawyers.
Several would have been arrested.
In Islamabad, lawyers for the Supreme Court bar called for a general strike and announced protests, following a wave of some 500 arrests over the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
Streets leading to the Supreme Court were blocked off Monday morning to prevent the rally.
Other protests were reported to have taken place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (northwest).
The lawyers’ movement on Monday garnered the support of religious parties grouped in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance whose president “urged the population to send flowers to the judges who ruled against the state of emergency and detritus to those who took the oath before Musharraf.”
"Musharraf's promise no longer holds."
The Pakistani Supreme Court is directly affected by the emergency measure proclaimed Saturday night.
It was to decide in the coming days on the legality of the presidential re-election, on October 6, by indirect suffrage, of President Musharraf.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was ousted and replaced.
“Everything we are seeing is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the rulings of the Supreme Court,” he told The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the army and become a civilian president "is no longer valid" after the state of emergency was imposed, Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to drop his military uniform by November 15, the date of the end of his first presidential term.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government has denied persistent rumours in the country that President Musharraf has been under house arrest by his deputy army chief.
More than a third of pregnancies are unplanned.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as poorly planned or unexpected births.
Even today, more than one in three pregnancies (36%) is not expected, reveals a study conducted by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the vote of the Neuwirth law that liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as poorly planned or unexpected births.
The different methods of contraception such as the pill or the IUD still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, estimates INED.
The liberalisation of contraception has nevertheless allowed for a better “control of fertility”, according to the institute, which notes that the rate of pill use among women aged 20 to 44 has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight out of ten births would be well planned today.
Even calculated to the nearest month for a couple out of five and if possible in spring, season judged as the most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
It took astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crewmates on the International Space Station (ISS) more than seven hours of work in space to make the spectacular repair of a torn solar panel, essential to the station's continued scientific activities.
A risky exit that has accumulated records because of its duration, its distance from the habitable modules, the speed with which it was imagined, the tools "diddled" by the astronauts to carry out the repair.
The problem appeared Tuesday when the astronauts had unloaded from the shuttle Discovery the module Harmony, a large cylindrical room in charge of hosting soon the European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is a kind of landing platform for laboratory modules.
We need to be able to supply them with electricity.
The crew’s second task was to move a 17.5-ton solar-panel power module already on the ISS to its final position.
After moving it, the crew began redeploying the module’s solar panels, which have a wingspan of 76 meters.
And this is where one of the panels, which unfold like accordions, was damaged over about a meter by a cable that got stuck.
The deployment was stopped so as not to damage the panel further.
The astronauts, who were originally supposed to perform a control exit of the Discovery shuttle, and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to go to the end of the 30 meters of length of the remote control arm of the shuttle added to that of the station to carry out the repair.
It is one of NASA’s best spacewalkers.
Large, resistant, very dexterous, he has a very developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, this doctor of training was therefore charged with "operating" the "wounded" solar panel.
After thoroughly inspecting the damage, he severed the faulty cable and installed some sort of "slats" on the damaged area.
He was aided by a second spacewalker who remained near the airlock and, from the inside, by other astronauts including Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini-hockey stick wrapped in insulation to prevent electrocution on solar panels producing several hundred volts, was designed and “diyed” by astronauts aboard the station.
Once the operation was complete, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before taking inventory of his tools and returning to the inside of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts were enjoying a half-day of relaxation before today, seven astronauts return to the shuttle Discovery for a return to Earth scheduled for Wednesday.
The EADS share sanctioned on the stock exchange
The EADS share is currently in sharp decline on the Paris stock exchange, after the aeronautics and defense group announced that it would have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to cope with the delays of the A400M.
EADS loses 4% to 21.96 euros currently on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to revise its operating profit forecast for 2007 following delays caused by the slow development of the A400M engine, which conditions the aircraft's maiden flight.
The cost to make up the delay in the delivery of its military transport aircraft, announced in October, is "between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, including more than 1 billion for Airbus", announced the parent company of the European manufacturer EADS.
As a result of these expenses, EADS will be forced to announce new operating income targets (EBIT) for 2007 at the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, he adds without further details.
The group also indicates that the estimate of new charges is consistent with the six-month delay.
As a reminder, EADS' operating income fell by 86% in 2006, mainly due to charges related to delays in another program, that of the very large A380 aircraft.
Initially, the group planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
There will be no suspense on Sunday at the exit of the polls: the Russians will massively opt for the party of President Putin, United Russia.
Confirming their aspiration for stability, even authoritarianism, after a very locked campaign.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin is today sending voters a televised message on public channels, already recorded but whose content is kept secret.
It does so as the head of the list of United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory promises to be overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president let nothing shine by welcoming foreign ambassadors, contenting himself with delivering a new charge against the West accused of meddling – his favorite theme during the campaign.
“We know the price of a true democracy and we want honest, transparent and open elections, elections without problems,” he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, this is far from being true.
She is denouncing a campaign tainted with pressure.
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said there had never been "such dirty elections, even in Yeltsin's time".
After the crackdown on protests last weekend, former world chess champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal protest, remains banned from visiting, according to his lawyer.
“The Russians have kept the mentality of homo sovietus”
Behind these unsuspended legislative elections, there are two questions that are much more open:
Who will succeed Putin as president?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, March 2, 2008; the candidates have until December 23 to make themselves known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot run for a third consecutive term.
No successor has emerged.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Head of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful United Russia party who would choose the government and the president?
In any case, in both the legislative and the presidential elections, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
“The Russians have kept the mentality of homo sovieticus, they don’t feel in control of their own destiny,” says sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent Levada center.
The historian Nikolai Koposov, from the St. Petersburg State University, goes back further: civil society has fallen behind in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; the famous communal spirit has delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, “Putin returned to the model of a paternalistic state, perfectly accepted by the population, especially since this new paternalism was not followed by terror, but by a certain economic ease,” says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians “willingly renounce personal responsibility” which they had briefly demonstrated after the break-up of the USSR.
“What’s the point of thinking?”
The phenomenon affects all social strata, including the business world.
And the administrative elite intends to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 heads of Russian regions) head the local lists of united Russia.
The new freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
Opinion prefers stability.
In the name of which the Russians will not vote for the extremists either.
Conclusion of Tamara Cherednychenko, a 54-year-old professor: “What is the point of thinking?
Those in power are not too bad, why change them?”
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which trace the destinies of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are freely accessible.
The 47 million archival documents, stored on 27 km of line in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were so far available only for "humanitarian" purposes, that is, individually and nominally, at the request of a former victim or his beneficiaries.
The eleven states in charge of their management – including Germany, France, Israel and the United States – agreed in May 2006 to open them to researchers and historians.
The process of ratification of this agreement by all States being completed, the opening has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will make it possible to carry out research “in particular on the movements of prisoners, the population of the camps and the state of health of forced workers”, explains Reto Meistern, the director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, including Germany, opposed the opening to the public of these nominative documents, because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
Like the supposed homosexuality or mental disability of some victims of deportation.
The registers of concentration camps or arrest warrants drawn up by the Gestapo had been compiled after the war for a practical purpose: to find the civilians deported or subjected to compulsory labour and, possibly, to provide them with proof of their internment, in order to pave the way for their compensation.
Even today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees process tens of thousands of individual applications.
Yet for some of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
“There is nothing fundamentally new to expect from these documents,” said Prof. Wolfgang Benz, director of the Research Centre on Antisemitism at the Technische Universit<0xC3><0xA4>t Berlin in 2006.
The EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
At present, bilateral Indo-European trade already amounts to almost EUR 60 billion per year.
The EU is India’s largest trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, said EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath.
In April, EU foreign ministers gave the green light to the European Commission to start negotiations on free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), with bilateral Indo-European trade already reaching nearly €60 billion a year.
The EU is India’s largest trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its biggest foreign investor, but India is only the EU’s ninth largest trading partner, according to European Commission figures.
“A free trade agreement would greatly benefit both economies,” and “India would improve its access to a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans,” Mandelson said.
Europe represents the first or the second market for each of the first ten products exported by India, said the European Commissioner. The Asian and European giants exchange annually for "47 billion euros of goods" and for "ten billion euros of services", said this week the president of the European Union, Mr. Dani<0xC3><0xA8>le Duraso.

The Bank of England takes note of the concerns by offering 10 billion pounds over five weeks
The Bank of England said on Thursday it was anxious to ease the current return of concerns about credit conditions, and announced an offer of <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion at the base rate of 5.75% over five weeks, an offer of unusual duration.
“To alleviate concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in how they will organize their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its planned supply of reserves during the maintenance period commencing on December 6 in the form of a five-week open market operation,” the bank said in a statement.
The bank says 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be put on the market on December 6 at 12:15 GMT, at the base rate and until January 10.
This appears to be the first time the BoE has placed five-week liquidity on the market in an open market operation.
These are usually done within a week.
The BoE said in a statement that it “stands ready to take further steps to maintain rates” of overnight interbank loans in line with its base rate.
The overnight interbank rate was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month rate was 6.6%, the highest since September 18.
Since the start of the financial crisis in the summer, the sums put on the market by the Bank of England were accompanied by a high penalty rate that had deterred banks from resorting to them.
According to some rumors, corroborated by the evolution of the price of the pound against the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the sums put on the market by the European Central Bank, at more advantageous rates and with a more assured discretion.
UMP and NC refuse consideration of PS proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and Nouveau Centre groups on Thursday refused to discuss the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which amounts to a rejection of the text.
Listed in a socialist "niche" (meeting at the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined a dozen measures adopted Tuesday by the national office of the PS among which the increase of 50% of the premium for employment, the reinstatement of the floating TIPP, a transport check or the supervision of rents.
UMP and NC having voted against the examination of the articles (180 votes against 115), the sitting was adjourned at the end of the general discussion which gave rise to exchanges, sometimes lively, between majority and opposition a few hours before the television intervention of Nicolas Sarkozy on the purchasing power.
The leader of the PS deputies Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his group will represent all of his proposals in the form of amendments to the amending finance bill considered by the Assembly next week.
A new festival is born
Following many rumors about the creation by C3 Presents of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in partnership with Festival Republic of British producer Melvin Benn.
“For our company, it’s an honor to work with a person who has, no less than, inspired the current festival movement in America,” C3’s Charlie Jones told Billboard.com.
C3 produces Chicago’s Lollapalooza Festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer camping destination.
The festival is scheduled to take place Aug. 8-10 on a 500-acre private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Formerly known as Mean Fiddler, Festival Republic director Melvin Benn is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took the helm of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which annually attracts some 80,000 people.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio and, in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival in Henham Park, Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been in charge of the production, licensing and organisational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Calling Glastonbury the “most inspiring event” he has ever attended, C3’s Charlie Jones says his company and Melvin Benn’s are working in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
“We had chosen Philadelphia as a market and were working diligently with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia,” says Charlie Jones.
“We were in talks with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited by this project.
“Unfortunately, we got bogged down in politics because of the current administration,” Jones said.
“Fortunately, we were able to chat with Melvin Benn and we are preparing to create a superb festival on an exceptional site that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia.”
C3 Presents revived the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at Chicago's Grant Park, after standing out in the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The two events recorded gross revenues of $9.8M and $11.3M in 2007, respectively.
Both festivals are held in urban areas.
“Melvin Benn’s European model is a country festival, while ours are rather urban green spaces,” says Charlie Jones.
The goal is to merge, in one way or another, the two formulas to give both an impression of rural festival to the European and urban to the American.
Vineland is roughly halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The community of Vineland, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports this event,” says Charlie Jones.
He declined to disclose the terms of the deal, but said they were "interesting enough to make it possible to invest in such an event and host a festival that, hopefully, will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the capacity of this festival is "very large", like that of 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that invitations have been issued to the groups, but that nothing could yet be confirmed when going to press.
“Vineland will be rock, but the music will be varied, hoping to attract all kinds of spectators,” says Charlie Jones.
His partners on C3, which received the Top Independent Promoter award at the last Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces the Terminator
It is not easy to attract Hollywood movie sets to Montreal when no one but Terminator opposes it...
This mission of seduction is part of the functions of delegate.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the "runaway productions".
Is it difficult to play into the hands of the “Governor”?
“We have to be careful, it’s the industry that decides where it goes.
If she finds the conditions in Montreal favorable, she will go.
Our role is to offer the ones they will judge the best,” he said.
The Race to the Festivals
For now, however, Denis Turcotte's priority is the promotion of local cinema.
The Oscars race has begun.
It will be all the festivals on the West Side, whether it is Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, to present Quebec films, highlight them and ensure that the directors do interviews.
The Dark Ages had a great showcase at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is playing in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a year-end rally on the stock market? Experts divided by the sub-prime crisis.
With less than five weeks to go before the end of the year, investors are already rubbing their hands in anticipation of the traditional end-of-year rally.
However, this year experts are not so sure that this will happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December on the stock market generally has a positive behavior.
However, it is not appropriate to make forecasts exclusively based on statistics, since given the current context, uncertainties lie ahead in the markets, at least in the short term.
Although they are not in favor of the stock market gaining momentum in the last weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the stock market is nourished by the existence of liquidity, willing to invest given the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the effect of flight to quality values both in the long term and in the short term".
For this, they believe that the stock market will behave rather sideways, not free from volatility "especially because we do not know the impact of the likely decline in Fed rates, given the high level of crude and the danger of stimulating inflationary tensions"
Javier Barrio, BPI’s head of sales in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time to say there will be a rally.
“It’s not the best thing,” says the expert.
The Ibex, the Spanish stock index, has lost nearly 4% since November 8, when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
However, not all experts have this negative view.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes that the Ibex 35 could close the year at 16,000 points thanks to the reorganization of portfolios and traditional contributions to pension plans that occur every year during these dates.
However, the expert nuances that things will be a little different this year since he believes that the rally will take place from the second week of December, after the bridge of Constitution Day (December 6).
The analyst does not consider that volatility will affect the market trend.
For his part, Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, evaluates that we are close to technical levels and "that is why we could observe a rebound in the index that could be caused according to the information that arrives from the European Union regarding the consequences of the crisis on the credit market".
The analyst hopes that these will be positive.
Analysts agree to choose the values that will be responsible for driving the Ibex to new maximum odds.
Solana, of Intermoney, says that "this year the great values are back for him".
The expert would include in the portfolio the two major banks and some manufacturers "because when the date approaches, the electricity sector will be very expensive".
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha, of Inversis Banco, says the increases will be due to the bank and the industrial sector.
The constructors will also benefit from this rally, in case they start it.
“ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we hope that other manufacturers such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path,” explains the expert.
Cyclical consumption will be the protagonist in the latter part of the year due to the increase in sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology companies will do it as well, although in this case there is not much representation in the Spanish market.
Five times for seven years
For the past seven years, December has been a bearish month on only two occasions.
The authentic year-end rally took place in 2003, an exercise during which the stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the bursting of the technological bubble.
This year, during which the Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, December recorded an increase of 6.68%.
It will be necessary to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of gains (for the moment the Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and if it succeeds computer on its year-end rally.
Banque Populaire will open 200 offices open 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
Banque Populaire has decided to renovate a large part of its offices.
A total of 200 banks are located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Populaire Max brand, represent a major change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish organizations, since it is the first group that decided to start betting on the uninterrupted opening of its agencies until 8:30 p.m., and to open on Saturday from 10 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.
Another group that has also reiterated several times that it would like to amplify the schedules of its branches, BBVA, even if it has not yet decided to take the first step.
It is about to strike a deal with unions to close 75% of its branches on Saturdays instead of opening an afternoon, but not to the public.
The results of the Banque Populaire experiment will be decisive for other organizations to adhere or not to this initiative which coincides with the business hours.
This is precisely what the Banque Populaire is looking for.
Attract autonomous customers who circulate in these areas to make their purchases in SMEs and shops on the streets chosen to open.
The bank wants to open these 200 branches located throughout Spain in about 18 months, since this is not the opening of new branches but a renovation of existing ones.
For this, the organization will modernize the branches it already has in commercial areas, adapting them to the profile of customers on the different streets.
In this way, the amplification of schedules is accompanied by a different design of the interior of the branch and a new design, more current, with brighter colors.
<0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivera, chief commercial officer of the bank, says that this renovation does not involve large investments, but the hiring of staff, since the number of employees will increase from six to eight or nine per agency.
The agencies, which will also have spaces for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Banque Populaire has already tested its initiative in three branches in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, as <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivero explains.
The branches of Murillo Brave Street, O'Donnell Street and Gran V<0xC3><0xAD>a Street in Madrid are the streets that have been chosen, and apparently successfully, according to Rivero.
Banque Populaire currently has 2,500 branches.
And 60 others who operate under the Mundocredit brand, specialized in the case of immigrants, also with very extensive schedules, which even open on Sundays and holidays.
In these PopularMax agencies they will not copy the BBVA model, where several of its agencies have a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
"We don't want to compete with our customers," Rivero said.
At the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica to sell mobile phones, with staff outside the bank.
Telecinco doubles for the first time the stock market value of its rival Antena 3
We got there.
With this phrase, Paolo Vasile, a managing director of Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction yesterday, at the close of the stock market, when he found that the chain he runs doubled the value of its rival, Antena 3.
A single aspect tarnished his joy: "What hurts me is not the fact that we have increased more but that we have decreased less," he said.
However, he emphasised that in a low market, ‘we fell less’.
Telecinco ended the day yesterday with an increase of 2.54%.
This gain has stabilized its loss at 15.66% for the past year.
The stock market value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and announced by Vocento (13% more) thus reaches 4,488.88 million euros, according to data from Bloomberg.
Its rival Antena 3, which sold yesterday 1.52% and has accumulated a decline of 40.5% since January, costs half, 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other communication companies listed on the stock exchange amounts to 3.571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2.518.53 million in that of Prisa (the publisher of Cinco D<0xC3><0xAD>as) and 1.779 million in that of Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenne 3 is due to the fact that ' we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact represents what we are able to do, in the same market, at what price and how we make it profitable in terms of audience.”
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become the first TV channel this year to surpass the 1,000 million gross advertising revenues, as assured Giuseppe Tringali, the managing director of Telecinco and Publiespa<0xC3><0xB1>a, the subsidiary that manages the advertising of the group.
For this announced figure to be real, the television channel should record for the current fiscal year an increase of 3.6% in its billing for advertising compared to 965.4 million in the 2006 fiscal year.
For its part, Antenna 3's net revenues increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (up to 734.4 million), while television's net revenues increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that the analysts point to for the best relative evolution of Telecinco in the Stock Exchange is the important pay out that it has maintained until now: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a has distributed 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile says that, although it is early to make a decision, this ratio could vary after the 33% purchase of Endemol and in association with Mediaset.
"We have the official compromise of giving a minimum of 50%, although we have always said much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to make our shareholders happy, those to whom we have already given titles with the 33% of Endemol.
According to analysts, the market is currently showing signs of fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its estimates of profits on Telecinco in 2008 to 4% and in 2009 to 7%.
This is due, they explain, to the decline in projected revenue growth from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
The same company decreased Antenna 3's earnings forecast to 4.5% in 2008 and to 7.5% in 2009.

Congress approves transposition of Mifid, which came into force on November 1
In parallel with its parliamentary formality, which ended today with the vote of the Congress on the amendments incorporated in the draft in the Senate, the Government submitted to a public hearing the regulations that will develop the new law, with the aim of its entry into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the various groups agreed to highlight the efforts of Members of Parliament and Senators to negotiate and agree on the best regulation to ensure the protection of investors and to regulate in detail the activity of the organizations so that the markets function effectively.
The MIFID, which amends the Securities Market Law, involves the modernization of the financial markets, at a time when it strengthens investor protection, improves the powers of the leaders of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the various leaders of the European Union.
The new regulation will allow financial advisory services to be provided both for specialised corporate purposes and to natural or legal persons and creates a new type of financial services (ESIS), financial advisory companies (FACs), which merge with securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, it increases the number of systems for the execution of transactions on financial instruments, so that it is possible to add to the regulated secondary markets multilateral trading systems and order internationalization systems, which compete with current stock exchange managers.
The Act also requires investment firms to disclose on the market information on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and forms of risk management and requires them to keep a record of all transactions they carry out, to facilitate control by the CNMV.
Passing through the Congressional Economics Committee, several amendments were added, including one that highlights that securitized debt will be considered a “complex” financial instrument given its high risk to the investor, which has been demonstrated with what happened with the debt of high-risk U.S. mortgages (subprime).
In addition, they took advantage of the transposition of the management took the opportunity to legally delimit the functions that graduates in Economics can have 30 years after in 1977 was approved, the royal decree that delimits the professional functions reserved for economists.
For its part, the Senate has incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as the mediator, who will work on behalf of a company, who will not require the authorization of the CNMV and who will be able to lend its services of marketing products and attracting new customers to different investment companies at the same time.
The Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices rose by five-tenths in November to 4.1%
This indicator, which is then used by Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides a balance sheet on the evolution of prices in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) by offering data comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The leading indicator is calculated using the same method as that used for the Harmonized Consumption Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate information not yet available at the time of publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the leading indicator is only indicative, because it does not necessarily coincide with the final data that will be revealed on December 14.
"The CPI will continue at relatively high levels"
The second vice president and economy minister, Pedro Solbes, said the 4.1 percent rise in CPI in November was a "time-based figure," but at the same time he predicted the price index would continue at "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes said in the corridors of Congress that "although the figure is not good" the inflation differential of Spain about the monetary union continues to be "more or less" the same as in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there was less surprise" than in the previous month, when the Government was not facing such a high increase.
"We expected a figure of around 4%," said the Minister of Economy in relation to the data announced today.
Virgin plans to recover €42 billion from Northern Rock over three years
Northern Rock’s deposits have fallen more than 50% to <0xC2><0xA3>12 billion since it went into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from the Bank of England.
At that time he was amassing a few record deposits above <0xC2><0xA3>25 billion, a figure that gradually fell in two and a half months because of the mistrust of his clients and despite the 100% guarantee of this money that the Government offered and that he will maintain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which would rename the organisation with its financial brand Virgin Money, needs to capture around a quarter of the revenues of UK banks that will be deposited in the next three years to get the remaining <0xC2><0xA3>18 billion until reaching the target of <0xC2><0xA3>30 billion.
The group of tycoon Richard Branson, known for his shrill advertising campaigns in the UK, plans to spend <0xC2><0xA3>50 million a year on advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock named the offer this week Virgin's association, in which three other companies participate, including his favorite to save him from bankruptcy.
The mayor of Totana was arrested for a plot of alleged urban corruption
The Civil Guard arrested today in the early morning the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana (Popular Party) because of his alleged relationship with the plot of urban corruption discovered this week.
In addition, one of the city council secretaries and the chief of police of the municipality were also arrested.
José Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez Andreo replaced last May's me Juan Morales, current right-wing deputy, and until then municipal councillor of the town hall, and who according to the sources of the investigation consulted by the SER Channel, could be the 'leader' of this plot.
Officers continue to search the municipal and town planning council premises and the possibility of new stops in the coming hours is not ruled out.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales, the main suspect in the urban corruption plot, discovered earlier this week, has been imputed.
As reported yesterday by the SER Channel to the lawyer of the deputy 'of the popular party' Juan Morales, he was arrested on leaving the house of Morales with important documentation in his possession relating to the plot.
In addition, according to sources of the investigation, the object of the investigation is the alleged collection of commissions from Morales in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a construction company in Galicia to redevelop 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, there are eight people detained.
Bono agrees to lead the Spanish Socialist Party’s bid for Toledo and to preside over Congress if they win the elections
Former Defense Minister José Bono accepted the offer of the President of the Government and the Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero, to be at the top of the list of the Spanish Socialist Party for Toledo for the next general elections and to be President of the Congress in the event that the Socialists will win the general elections.
Thus the secretary of organization of the Spanish Socialist Party, José Blanco, and Bono himself announced it during a press conference after the meeting that took place this noon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The head of the Executive justified the offer made to the former minister because "it is important to count on the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
In addition, he stressed that "yes it seems" that the politician from La Mancha will be the candidate of the socialist group that will preside over the Congress if the socialists win the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Mar<0xC3><0xAD>n as president of Congress, who on November 15 made public his decision not to stand for the next general election and to abandon his political career to devote himself to the fight against climate change in the academic context.
The former minister acknowledged that the Prime Minister has not stopped insisting that he return to the political vanguard since he abandoned him two years ago.
In addition, he noted that, although citizens already know who will be the economic vice-president if the Spanish socialist party wins the elections, his party wanted to announce who will preside over the Congress, in an "act of transparency".
If he reaches the post, Bono hopes to turn the House into "a house of respect and not insult or yelling" and make it "more and more like citizens".
“Sometimes it seems lamentably that the only place in Madrid where one cannot speak quietly and calmly is the Congress, the President of the Government in the Senate on some occasions has been interrupted 26 times.”
In the same way, he had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Mar<0xC3><0xAD>n and "his know-how" and he did not want to act as if he was already occupying his position so as not to fall, as he pointed out, into what his opponents might consider "a domination".
Climate Propaganda
Given that the climate change movement is mercilessly persecuting both the skeptics of its predictions and those who prioritize other political and social battles, it must demonstrate iron coherence.
This is all the more the case for a leader of the movement who is president of the Government like Zapatero and who believes that this struggle is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and who even proposes to sign a "new contract for the planet".
This approach obliges him to explain why the action, or inaction, of his Government has contributed decisively to Spain being at the head of the European Union in the non-execution of the Kyoto Protocols.
Who are responsible for the non-execution, in what areas it occurred and why his Government, the Government of the contract with the planet, did not avoid it.
In addition, he must clearly explain to the Spaniards what measures he will take to curb climate change.
What companies will be affected, what habits of citizens will have to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings we will be forced to make, what economic consequences it will cause.
That is, who will sacrifice and who will pay to save the planet.
But there has been and there will be no explanation.
Precisely because it is a question of sacrificing and paying.
The measures against climate change, the real measures, are unpopular.
Expensive, uncomfortable and threatening to the accounts of companies and individuals.
Even one-hundredth of the essence suggested by the Spanish Socialist Party seemed to Zapatero so perceptively dangerous that he hastened to deny it.
That is to say, it is a question of saving the planet with nothing, only with propaganda, with slogans empty of any real consequence.
With sentences that have impact, commissions, committees, protocols, new positions.
With these contracts with the planet, this gentleman so useful for electoral campaigns who does not speak, who does not denounce and who does not demand, embellishes the meetings and inspires tenderness.
Provided that this is limited only to being a purely virtual contracting party and does not pretend that we move by bicycle or refresh ourselves with the fan.
The mayor and the head of the local police of Totana arrested for an alleged plot of urban corruption
The Spanish gendarmerie has arrested the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the "popular" José Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the City Hall and a hotel entrepreneur suspected of possible urban crimes, informed today the sources of the investigation.
The municipal councillor was arrested at his home and was taken to the town hall, where at the moment many agents gathered, who also presented themselves to the function of municipal councillor of Urbanism and to the municipal company of management of the Industrial Soil and Housing.
These three stops are in addition to the six stops made last Monday in the provinces of Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation relating to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land to urbanize so that the Galician company Nuaria can build 4,000 homes, after the payment of illegal commissions during the last legislature.
In addition, two other people have not been arrested but they are charged in the judicial investigation, which the Court No. 1 of Totana is investigating.
The first six detainees have now been handed over to a court order.
According to the sources, the previous municipal councilor of Totana and currently an autonomous parliamentarian of the PP party, Juan Morales, is targeted by the investigation.
In addition, the ex-wife, owner of a real estate agency currently registered in Totana, was imputed, as well as the current fiancée of the former municipal councilor, who resides in Murcia.
The director and owner of Nuaria Group, the lawyer and entrepreneur from Vigo (Galicia) Manuel N.A., were arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, agency of Nuaria Group, through which the bribes were allegedly carried out.
The investigation is the responsibility of the Urban Crime Group of the Central Operational Unit (UCO) of the gendarmerie whose agents, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven inspections, the majority in companies related to detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
So only one person was arrested in Totana, in short, the owner of a well-known poultry business in the region, who could have played the role of intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for the development of the largest residential complex in the Murcian municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 homes, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company has acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana that have been requalified and its project would involve doubling the population of the municipality, which currently has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group is made up of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which deal with real estate development; Conycase, which manages the Vigo car parks in the streets of Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a, Venezuela and the Plaza de Fernando el Cat<0xC3><0xB3>lico; Hogartel, which deals with direct marketing; Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and installation of construction elements.

Our Finnish correspondent provides us with yesterday's commentary in Finland's most important newspaper (certainly at the head of PISA information above the educational level in the world), the Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day it appeared there, curiously, the criticism of Blackburn's book:
"The content of the Philosophy course appealed to public opinion as a consequence of the tragedy of the Jokela school.
The culprit of the dead, a baccalaureate student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Education Advisor in charge of Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Plato on what is written in the pages of the daily Helsingin Sanomat and he affirmed that studying Nietzsche is not indispensable in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in high schools.

A colleague passes on information on the introduction in the Criminal Code of offences on downloads on the Internet:
A. Downloading a song would be an offence punishable by six months to one year.
On the other hand, theft in a CD store for a value of less than 400 euros, is considered only as a fault (article 623.1).
B. Theft in a store for a value up to 1,000 euros is already considered a crime, but the penalty is less than that imposed for downloading (article 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty is less than that imposed for the download (an article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the traffic of compact discs.
Participating in a tumultuous brawl carries a sentence of three months to one year (Article 154 of the Penal Code) and trafficking in CDs would carry a sentence of six months to two years
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a movie, according to article 184.2 of the Penal Code.
F. The distribution of films protected by copyright and without the authorization of the authors is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (article 186).

My attending physician told me about one of his papers on strange research titled, “Money Produces Brain Activations, Especially If Others Get Less.”
That is, the feelings generated by the monthly pay of workers depend on what colleagues earn.
The study was carried out using tomographic magnetic resonance imaging at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, study author and director of the neurocognition imaging group at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: “The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his companion failed.”
The researchers observed that when both people guessed that they were receiving the same pay, the activation was moderate, but if one of them received double the activation was greater.
I don't know if this conclusion required so much science.
The Prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly prosecuting war criminals in the Balkans for eight years from the prosecution office of the Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, which is located in The Hague.
Her mandate ends at the end of the year and Carla leaves with a bitter taste, because the main perpetrators of the murder of Srebrenica - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims died -, the former General Ratko Mladic and the former Serbo-Bosnian leader Radovan Karadzic, are still at large.
Their names are in this list whose documentary by the Swiss director Marcel Sch<0xC3><0xBC>pbach takes its title, 'Carla's List' (2006, not screened exclusively in Spain), with the rhythm of a police thriller, which follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York who prosecutes the criminals on the run and puts pressure on the governments involved to narrow the circle.
What insurance is right for me?
Car insurance, which covers the driver against possible claims, involves a significant expense that will depend on various factors, such as age, gender, seniority of the driver's license, marital status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use made of it, among others.
Having a car is the main thing.
Choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
And it is that, choosing the right auto insurance, is even more difficult than choosing the model of the vehicle.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurer.
This compromise takes the form of an insurance contract, which establishes that the company receives the value of the premium granted and in return becomes responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a claim.
The premium is the price of the insurance, which is established taking into account various factors, such as age, gender, seniority of the driver's license, marital status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use made of it, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices based on statistics, so that the higher the probability of an accident, the higher the rating to be paid.
It is for this reason that people over 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, since statistics show that these people have a lower claim rate due to their prudence.
Similarly, using censuses, companies have concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use made of the vehicle will affect the frequency, and therefore the probability of having an accident.
By increasing the frequency, the probabilities increase.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when setting the premium price.
For this reason, the driver must carefully study the situation to choose the car insurance that best suits his profile.
Here we will show the most significant variables when choosing one or the other type of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insurer, offers a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 face various disadvantages when contracting with affordable insurance, such as limited driving experience and seniority of the driver's license.
Although the ideal insurance is all-risk insurance, there are other, more economical options.
The most forward-thinking drivers can opt for any risk insurance with deductible, so that they get the coverage of any risk insurance but at a more affordable price.
This form of agreement implies that the customer pays part of the amount of the claim.
"The part of the amount of the claim that the customer pays will be established according to the value of the premium, which will be higher the lower the amount will be," specifies Luis Noguera, the head in Spain of First Europa, online insurance mediator.
Another option is extended third-party insurance, so that the customer provides protection to deal with damage caused to third parties, but by those caused on his own car.
In addition, it would be covered against theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
A word of advice.
If you are under 25 years of age try to be careful and avoid claims as much as possible, since this will affect the bonus, which can reduce the price of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction in the basic rate that the company has.
On the contrary, a penalty is an increase in the basic tariff.
“The bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and the company’s profit.
If the company has had a good year it can afford to increase the bonuses, "clarifies Noguera.
Beyond the age of 25 it becomes easier for drivers to contract with insurance, since the loss rate is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
For this reason, it is best to choose an all-risk insurance with franchise.
"Normally young people can not enjoy the experience previously acquired after an accident," says the director of the European company in Spain and adds that the majority of accidents occur during the second year of driving, once the 'fear of the novice' has passed.
However, if the client is married but does not yet have children, it is preferable that he negotiates insurance at any risk, as long as his economic situation allows it.
Marriages with children are considered by insurers to be the people with the lowest claims rate, because the premiums will be lower.
In this case the best insurance would be an all-risk insurance with deductible (can be 300 euros), or an extended third-party insurance from the third year of life of the vehicle when the insured has a high level of bonus.
"They have a more relaxed driving and they have a greater purchasing power to allow themselves the luxury of taking on a larger amount of franchises," says Luis Noguera.
For retirees, an all-risk insurance with deductible is preferable (being this one of 150 euros), or an extended third-party insurance when the insurer has a high level of bonus.
It must be said that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver against possible claims, but also because it represents a significant expense, which is why it is fundamental to properly study the insurance that best suits us according to our personal situation.
Celtic will try to win a point in Milan to reach the round of 16
AC Milan and Celtic Glasgow face next Tuesday in San Siro in search of the point they lack to achieve their respective goals in the closing of the Champions League, since it serves the Italians to be first and the Scots to qualify.
The Italians have ten points and have already qualified on matchday five thanks to a draw in Portugal, while Celtic Glasgow have nine points, but he still needs another point to make sure Shakhtar Donetsk, who have six, and Benfica, who have four, do not pass him.
These two Group D matches will be played a week before the sixth matchday ends, as AC Milan are due to play the Club World Cup semi-finals in Japan on the 13th of this month in search of a place for the final on 16 December.
Thus, this group will remain closed before the draw at the Giuseppe Meazza Stadium seems to be the most anticipated result, although both teams will try to come out victorious, since the Italians will not want to speculate at home and Celtic Glasgow knows that by winning he would remain first and ensure a better crossing in the round of 16.
A loss by Gordon Strachan's team could be enough to qualify if Shakhtar Donetsk does not win, but it will not be able to computer only on this since with nine points the games go to the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but who won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanese will try to poison the evening to the Scots, who are hopeful of qualifying for the round of 16 for the second time in the Champions League, after being beaten during the last edition by a goal of Kaka during the extra time (1-0).
Pending the victory of the 'rossoneri' the triumph would return only to Shakhtar, in case Celtic would lose, to qualify for the round of 16 to be able to continue the UEFA Champions League.
And it is that Benfica, although it is last and without opportunities to continue the European competition, could reach third place with a victory.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls tour in Vancouver
The Spice Girls opened in Vancouver, Canada, in front of about 20,000 spectators, their first tour since the group disbanded in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) said shortly before starting their concert at Vancouver's GM Place stadium that the band's reunion is "brilliant".
Around 20,000 people sold out to attend the concert, which was the subject of a video that tells the story of the band that was raging in the late 1990s.
The encounter and the world tour coincide with the launch of a new album that resumes their main hits as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which EMI publishes in Spain.
The five members of the Spice Girls went on stage showing the bracelets that the husband of 'Posh Spice' had offered them, the British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was in the crowd that filled the GM Place, even though Victoria had banned him a few days before.
Before the show began, Victoria Beckham remarked that the British footballer "didn't see our costumes so I'm nervous because I don't know what he's going to think of the show".
Sporty Spice, who left the group in 1998 "because of the differences between us" and who caused the dissolution of the group two years later, also expressed nervousness during an interview with the press, two hours before the start of the show.
"I was scared.
I was nervous but I saw that people's feelings changed, the feeling for the Spice Girls changed.
And I thought why not, I'm glad I made a decision," Chisholm said of the group's meeting that she disbanded nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time, "things have worked out and we appreciate each other a lot."
But a lot has changed since the Spice Girls last performed in 1998.
For starters, according to CTV television, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines plane.
When they arrived at the airport, an army of babysitters was waiting for them.
They have five sons.
After the Vancouver concert, the band will perform in California (USA), San José (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
In Madrid they will exhibit on December 23.
The new gas deal between Russia and Ukraine is sounding the alarm.
A dispute over the price of gas is brewing between Ukraine and Russia, increasing the risk of repercussions on fuel exports to Europe.
Most Russian gas exports to the European Union (EU) are transported by pipelines, and each pipeline is scrupulously monitored.
Kiev has announced that if Russia increases the cost of fuel, it will increase transit taxes to Russia.
Last year, an altercation between the two caused a decrease in supplies to EU countries.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes after the Ukrainian government and Gazprom, Russia’s monopoly-owned gas supplier, tried in vain to reach an agreement on the cost of Russian gas supplied to Ukraine for the year 2008.
Gazprom said it would increase its prices to Ukraine as it agreed to pay for 2008, up to 50% more for the supply of gas from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts said this would lead to a 40% increase in the costs of imports from Gazprom for Ukraine.
"It is essential for us to use all our arguments during the talks, recalling that we are a country through which most of the gas passes," Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinkh told Reuters news agency.
Fluctuations in gas costs would likely be related to our discussions about transit taxes (toward Western Europe) via Ukraine.
The last major dispute between Moscow and Kiev caused in January 2006 the interruption of Gazprom's supplies to Ukraine.
This led to a fall in exports to Western Europe, thereby raising prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of EU supplies.
Russia has the largest gas stocks, although most of them are still underdeveloped.
As a result, Gazprom is supplementing its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Union nations in Central Asia.
The Ministry of Health "must control its foreign employees".
Scotland's health ministry needs to improve checks on its non-EU employees to see if they have criminal records, the control committee said.
The warning from the Auditor General, Robert Black, came after a foreign doctor working in Scotland, was involved in the attack at Glasgow Airport in June.
Mr. Black further expressed concern that the Scottish Ministry of Health has no specific data on the number of overseas people it employs.
His report did, however, highlight other critical controls, which were properly carried out on a sample of employees from five health authorities.
The Auditor General has carried out checks on extra-Community staff following the attack on Glasgow airport.
Bilal Addullah, a 28-year-old doctor of Iraqi descent serving at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after driving his jeep into the gates of the main terminal.
He was one of three doctors who were filmed at the Old Bailey in October because they were suspected of being involved in various car bombing attempts in the UK.
The Ministry of Health will have to carry out pre-employment checks on overseas staff, to be certain of the validity of their qualifications, experience, and work permits for the UK.
Although the Scottish Ministry of Health uses the Scottish Disclosure to conduct background checks, the agency has no right to obtain such information outside of Great Britain.
Among the many caveats, the Auditor General's report now states that committees are required to confront the Office of Precedent Penal Review, thus allowing employers to undertake reviews on various countries.
"Although we have found that some personnel information has been verified, this is not done every time," the report said.
Mr Black said that the Scottish Ministry of Health carries out most of the pre-employment checks that it would do itself, but he also added: "Our report highlights areas where the system can be improved to ensure that adequate information on certain overseas staff is available to health services.
Peter Terry, president of BMA Scotland, said it was “extremely unlikely” that pre-employment checks could identify employees likely to commit future terrorist acts.
He said "the report suggests that the pre-employment checks currently being carried out are working well in the Scottish health system and it is not certain that these warnings could bring any added value."
Scottish health authorities said they employed 1,161 people overseas, mostly doctors and nurses.
But the auditor general pointed out that these numbers certainly need to be revised upwards, in part because of problems with identifying staff members with permanent contracts, who may or may not choose to remain in our country.
The investigation has shown that the current control procedures of the health authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian, are quite adequate.
These checks are carried out on passports, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently revising its policy and system of pre-employment controls for overseas health service staff.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: “I was excited to do this work in the wake of the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport.
She added that the Scottish Government allied with the health committees would carefully consider the warnings set out in the report due to be published next month, and would commit to ensuring better implementation of the recently updated pre-employment controls, which are valid for all employees, including those from overseas.
Joy Division dominates the Oscars.
Control, the biopic about Joy Division’s latest singer, Ian Curts, won five awards, including best picture, at the British Independent Film Oscars.
The trophies were also awarded to star Sam Riley, who worked in a department store until he was cast as Curtis in the film directed by Anton Corbijn and co-star Toby Kebbell.
Judi Dench was named Best Actress for her role in the thriller “Notes on a Scandal.”
Daniel Craig, the Bond star, won the Variety Award for allowing the British film to be under the international spotlight.
The awards were presented during the ceremony at London's Round House.
Control chronicles Curtis' rise to success with Joy Division, until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
The black-and-white film, whose soundtrack was directed by The Killers, David Bowie and New Order, was shot on a budget of just 3 million Sterling.
But the Dutch photographer, best known for his iconic cover of U2's Joshua Tree album, has won two awards, the first as best director and the second as best first-time director.
Le Rock was also awarded the Best Documentary Award for Julien Temple’s film about Clash singer Joe Strummer.
The Best Actor award went to Viggo Mortensen for his portrayal of the driver of a Russian mob boss in David Cronenberg’s London-based thriller, Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone, renowned for his tough character portrayals, won the Richard Harris Award for outstanding contribution to British film.
The 50-year-old director, who has shot films such as Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the Indiana Jones sequel, The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to receive the award named in honor of star Harris, who starred in Camelot and Harry Potter and died in 2002.
Richard Harris and Albert Finney have given people like me access to cinema,” he said.
“I’ve been lucky enough to meet Richard Harris twice.”
“I was admiring this great actor today, I was extremely honored.”
The independent film Oscars, better known as "the Bifas" are awarded by a jury composed of directors, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa fans and bosses include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom
Saudi Arabia Blocks 208 Terrifying Plots
Saudi Arabia yesterday revealed that it had arrested 208 activists involved in organizing cells plotting an imminent attack on an oil site, as well as attacks on clerics and armed forces.
The state television of the world's largest oil exporter, said that one of the cells of missile smugglers.
Al Qaeda sympathizers have staged a campaign against the U.S.-allied monarchy since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign resident, was planning an attack on an oil site in the Eastern Province, the TV newspaper said.
Saudi Arabia quickly formed a group of 35,000 soldiers to protect the sites, following a failed attack by Al Qaeda in 2006 against the largest oil site in Abqaiq.
The newspaper, citing a statement by the interior minister, said 18 of those arrested belonged to a cell led by a “missile-launching expert” who had infiltrated the country.
It is said that the militants were planning the counter-band of eight missiles in the kingdom.
22 people among the detainees appear to have conspired to assassinate clergymen and armed forces.
The government urged clerics to do more against the Saudis led in Iraq, to join al Qaeda militants fighting the Allied Forces and against the Shiite Muslim government allied with the United States, considered heretical by the hardline Sunny Saudis.
Al Qaeda militants believe that in Saudi Arabia, many clerics have collaborated with the authorities to support the royal family’s policy that dominates the government.
The militants, emboldened by calls against the pro-Western Saudi government by Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden of Saudi origin, targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy supply sites.
Important efforts have been made by the armed forces over the past five ... months," the interior minister's spokesman told state television.
Among the detainees are 16 members of the Medina organized in a "media cell" aimed at promoting "takfiri thought", the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals who support the use of violence against infidel and apostate Muslims.
Among the detainees, 32 people are accused of having subsidized the activists.
The climate of Venus could reveal the future of Earth.
Scientists said yesterday that Venus was certainly a pleasant planet to live on.
Data from the European spacecraft in orbit have shown that the planet is certainly twice as small as Earth, contrary to what was previously thought.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
These two worlds are about the same size, with similar orbits, although Venus is closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, Venus may have had conditions similar to Earth’s, and may even have been habitable.
But the greenhouse effect due to carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion due to solar radiation combined with a slower rotation led Venus to another kind of evolution.
Today the planet is devoid of water, is ravaged by hurricanes and lightning storms and has a surface temperature warm enough to melt lead.
The findings of the European Space Agency's Venus Express probe, which has been studying the planet for a year, offer a grim view of Earth's potential future due to catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor, one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: “We are beginning to understand why Venus’ climate is so different from Earth’s, although the planets themselves are virtually similar.
“Our new data allow us to establish a scenario according to which billions of years ago, Venus would have been originally identical to Earth, maybe even with a habitable surface.”
Enriched uranium seized by the police.
A kilo of radioactive material, apparently uranium, was seized by the Czechoslovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
A police officer said three people had been arrested and the equipment was currently being analysed.
He did not confirm that it was indeed uranium, but revealed that the commodity would be worth $1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>480,000).
Still open to everything
Mitt Romney said he was not up to the job as a presidential candidate, to answer questions from a snowman.
Despite this, the Republican presidential candidates eventually agreed to participate in the You Tube debate, during which many ordinary voters, having registered their questions, submit them to the candidates.
On Wednesday night, none of the questions posed were as ridiculous as the one from another You Tube debate, when a snowman asked Democrats their position on global warming.
But this time, the questions and answers reflected the conditions of the Republican party, candidate in the next elections.
It is not known on what criteria, the producers of CNN, which sponsored the debate, chose the clips of You Tube to show to the would-be candidates.
But the first half-hour of the debate, the longest on a single topic, focused on immigration.
The subject is one of the strong subjects for Republicans.
CNN asked some voters to call when they heard pleasant things: The board noted increases in approval when candidates spoke in a rude manner.
The hardest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, leader of the national front, and Mr. Romney who is leading the important early elections in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani tried to highlight the fact that he was accommodating about illegal immigration during his tenure as mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of employing illegal immigrants at his home.
The two fighters became particularly ferocious when asked if they would be willing to promote “amnesia” (offering illegals regular status and the possibility of becoming citizens).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, have managed to dig deeper into the subject.
Neither of them has the opportunity to be elected, but both remain in the race, perhaps thanks to the fact that they began to fight immigration earlier and more incisively than the others.
In general, candidates, at least with regard to immigration, have the same views: more rigid borders, and zero tolerance for illegal immigrants.
This subject, combined with concerns about toxic toys made in China, or other fears of the outside world, encourage Republicans to forget, or minimize, the divisions between libertarians and Catholic conservatives.
But the debate became especially embarrassing when other issues were raised.
Giuliani asked why he had previously supported the arms control campaign.
John McCain and Romney debated whether putting water in the nose should be considered torture.
One of the speakers asked if the candidates believed in its entirety, in the content of the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to dare declare that the Bible is his favorite book, even if he is not sure to believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another speaker asked if Jesus would have been in favor of the death penalty.
It was not expected that Mike Huckabee, in Iowa’s pole position in a recent election, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism, would declare that the death penalty is painful though necessary.
When pressed on whether Jesus would have been in favor, he laughed and said Jesus is too smart to run for office.
The human race remains unusually open to everything.
Mr. Huckabee’s ascent to Iowa coincides with the recent stupendous grant research conducted by libertarian Ron Paul, and the whistling at Wednesday’s debate.
These two emerged from nowhere, thanks to the fact that the two protégés of the party are unable to agree on who is the best-known and most traditionalist candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, one candidate united the party early and convincingly with a successful message about American greatness that brought leaders together.
This time, the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
The Pains of Labour
Gordon Brown discovered a new hole to sink into; even if he resigned, the situation would not change.
Given the trend of British scandals, this one is not particularly juicy.
No decorations sold, no Parisian hotel bills from politicians, no extra-marital toe sucked.
But now a revelation attests that a wealthy businessman would have masked for four years, under false names, his contributions to the current Labour Party, equivalent to more than <0xC2><0xA3>650,000 ($1.3m), that the party would not have declared: A new battle that Gordon Brown would have done well.
Two months ago, the prime minister backtracked on his election bid, foolishly insulting British intelligence by proclaiming that opinion polls did not influence his decision, and that he hoped instead to deliver a compact and effective government.
On the contrary, like Vince Cable, the brilliant Liberal Democratic leader, said that the terrifying Mr. Brown has transformed himself from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The takeover of Northern Rock, a struggling bank on the brink of crack, demonstrated a flaw in guidelines and poor judgment in an emergency.
Inadequate proposals to change the tax code have provoked a coalition of industry groups against the government.
The loss of 25 million pieces of personal data by the tax authorities revealed an incredible administrative clutter.
A trio of retired generals have launched a revolt among the Lords, protesting against cuts in military spending: they have proclaimed that being defence minister is for them a part-time job.
At present, suspicion of shady donations from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Labour secretary general (and his former head of vigilance) have caused them to resign.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is unfailingly heading for the exit.
However, governments can reach a point where it would be impossible to govern.
People don’t like politicians, and don’t trust them, but usually leave their doubts aside when a new government comes to power.
It seems obvious that a Prime Minister cannot improve things, or even govern for a long time, when he risks suspension: the public administration no longer works; the cabinets of ministers take stock; the press looks for bad stories; and the government becomes defensive and without any further objective.
In a sense, Mr. Brown’s position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, he cannot boast of being a beginner.
Although he would like to repudiate Tony Blair, he was still his senior lieutenant.
The problems with Northern Rock and tax data, for example, are related to Mr. Brown's decisions when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer.
And even if he is not directly involved in Blair’s woes, such as the long-running investigation into the party’s “cash for members of the House of Lords” funds, voters might think otherwise.
But Mr. Brown's plight is not as tragic as it seems.
The gaffes are not as monstrous as the Tory party would have you believe.
As in Mr. Bean, there are no victims or scams.
And the remedy, while painful, might be to concretize Mr. Brown’s long-standing Stalinist tendencies, in favor of a reliable and slightly brutal government.
The new scandal over political donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, a very particular character, who compares his donations to charity, said he did not want any public recognition of his charity.
He may have his opinion, but it is not up to him to decide.
The laws against the anonymity of politicians’ big funders are clear, and they exist for a good reason: The public has a right to know who contributes to the success of those who will rule the country.
Mr Watt, who said he was aware of Mr Abrahams' programmes without knowing that it was illegal, will therefore have to be questioned, as will Jon Mendlesohn, the grant-raiser who spoke about the questionable donations in October.
But so far Mr. Brown is not involved: There is no evidence that he was aware of these steps, even though most of the payments made were made following his arrival in government in June.
So far the Prime Minister has done half.
He quickly condemned his party's legislative flaw, but did not draw attention to the fact that the decision-making power rests on something he knows well, resorting to a committee of inquiry on this subject composed of a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons to be learned are not complicated.
And if the law has been flouted, it is the responsibility of the police.
In addition, there are many other things Mr. Brown must do, such as finding a permanent chair for the independent Standards of Public Life committee, without a leader for six months, and preparing a good reform on the financial side of political parties.
This would force the Labour Party, in a moment of weakness, to collaborate with the Tories, which could lead it to give up its particular financial relationship with the confederations; in short, a bitter pill for a supporter such as Mr Brown.
But he should face certain partisan facts.
The Conservative party now has a good lead in the election; it has two years to win back the voters, and the only way to win a victory is to demonstrate impeccable integrity and strong skills.
Card scams.
Would the mortgage crisis contaminate the U.S. credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, it is normal to see fins whirling around.
Now that the U.S. real estate market is going through a critical phase, predators are targeting the U.S. credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs believe credit card losses could reach $99 billion if contagion spreads from mortgages to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in fees and insolvency rates, which measures the unrecoverable or unrecoverable balance sheet shares more than 30 days later.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken $1.4 billion in consumer loans, in part because of weak cardholders.
It is too early to panic.
Fees and insolvencies are still moderate.
According to Moody’s, a tax agency, the third-quarter insolvency rate of 3.89% is almost one point lower than its historical average.
The deterioration in rates is partly explained by technical factors.
A 2005 change in personal bankruptcy laws in the United States caused a steep drop in bankruptcy records, which in turn caused heavy losses for credit cards; the number of records (and thus insolvency rates) could increase even if borrowing conditions worsened.
The industry also announces fixed payment rates, which highlight the amount of monthly debt that consumers have to pay.
and confidence in the capital security of credit cards is quite strong despite the paralysis of other aspects of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research firm, predicted that the emission volume for 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
The direct links of infection between the mortgage crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers might prefer to increase their debt now that fair real estate borrowing is gone.
But card issuers pay more attention to the flow of cash rather than the value of wealth, and so the fall in real estate prices has not necessarily led to a change in the credibility of borrowers.
They could even bring benefits to issuers of credit securities.
Consumer premiums for mortgage payments fall if properties cost less than the value of the loan; as a result, credit card debt would become a priority for repayment.
Card issuers are able to respond much faster than mortgage holders and with more flexibility to such crisis conditions, as they can change interest rates or alter credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of having a quick recovery of stocks.
“We’re not going to wake up one morning and reevaluate all the borrowings,” said Gary Perlin, the director of Capital One.
If a credit card market financial disaster is unlikely, there is a high risk of having a significant decline.
If lower real estate prices and a contraction in the credit market lead America into recession, the industry will certainly face a macabre future.
Pay close attention to the dorsal fins.
British bankers plead guilty to the Enron case.
The three British bankers who were due to testify about a fraud by Enron’s former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, changed their statements, pleading guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had initially pleaded not guilty to the seven counts of alleged collusive fraud in 2000, committed by Fastow in a secret financial scam in order to get rich in spite of their employees.
They are expected to appear in court in January.
But during a hearing presided over by U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., they all pleaded guilty to fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a subsidiary of the PLC group of the Royal Bank of Scotland, became famous throughout Britain because of extradition proceedings that lasted two years.
In the United States, their case remains an outstanding issue for this investigation launched following the fall of Enron in 2001.
The charges brought against him in 2002 made it clear to Fastow that he was the subject of the government's investigation into the Enron debacle.
The charges against the bankers, dubbed the “Natwest Three,” claim they came to Houston in 2000 to arrange a fraudulent scenario with Fastow and his former right-hand man, Michael Kopper.
NatWest Greenwich invested in a subsidiary of an Enron partner controlled by Fastow, who was the director of many fraudulent scenarios, which helped him rig the bankruptcy proceedings.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had estimated its interest in the subsidiary as nil, but in fact the three British already know its value.
A company controlled by Kopper bought the bank's interest from the subsidiary for <0xC2><0xA3>1 million.
The bankers paid $250,000 to Kopper as interest for this company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely announced to Enron that the energy company was willing to pay Greenwich NatWest $20 million for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in truth this $20 million went into the pockets of British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the accusations, the bankers would have obtained $7.3 while Fastow, Kopper and the others would have earned $ 12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to his active role in two conspiracies in the Enron debacle.
The British trio were arrested three months later.
Fastow endures a six-year incarceration in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is incarcerated for 3 years and a month in a prison in Texarkana.
The three Britons were released following the payment of a bail of $1million each, forcing them to live in the United States during the trial.
Enron, previously the seventh largest national company, bankrupt in December 2001 after years of accounting rigging, could no longer hide its billions of debt or even offer its phony speculations as profitable.
The collapse caused thousands of layoffs, more than $60 billion in loss of market value, and more than $2 billion in loss to retirement plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their involvement in the company’s collapse.
Skilling was sentenced to more than 24 years in prison.
Charges against Lay for conspiracy, fraud and other misdemeanors were in vain because of his death from a heart attack last year.
Not out of Moscow, not out of Moscow.
The cost of a G550 Gulfstream aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and with sufficient fuel autonomy to fly non-stop from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
But this is only a small change for some Russians.
“It can carry up to 18 passengers,” said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
“Even if no one really needs that many seats because it’s more of a family-use plane or for the president of a company.”
Mr. Firer was present at the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Millions Show, a four-day consumer-incitement orgy held in a huge exhibition center around the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other exhibitors were present with their stands, hoping to arouse the interest of the newly rich Russians for their varied products, ranging from mahogany yachts to cars filled with diamonds like those of 50 Cent.
Mr. Firer scrutinized a bright orange Porsche, displayed next to his stand.
“It’s a nice car, but nothing like our product,” he said.
“After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft.”
“Thanks to an oil boom, the Russian capital seems to be rolling in black gold, like Dallas.”
“We experienced the same thing in the 1890s, when some Americans became so rich and landed in Europe where they were considered materialistic,” said Marshall Goldman, a senior scholar in the Davis Department of Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudis in the 1970s, the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians are emerging as the world’s biggest spenders.
The biggest luxury brands are looking for their place in the Klondike.
This week, at another location in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry allowed Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, to exchange ideas on the strategy to follow for the sale of luxury goods to markets such as Russia.
(The conference was organized by the International Herald Tribune, which is owned by The New York Times.)
Russia has 53 billionaires worth $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, two-thirds of the rich are made up of 103,000 Russian millionaires who are globally worth $670 billion, according to a study on the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, conducted by economists at the Center for Economic and Financial Research.
(The World Bank reported that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived below the poverty line.)
“There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow, that’s why we’re all here,” said Nicole Marais, a representative of Davis Morris, a London jeweler.
She participated in the show for the first time in the company of the Russian distributor, The Soho Jewellery Group.
“Women are all well prepared and men are worth a fortune.”
Strolling in the living room on Sunday evening, the two real estate agents put on their 31, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26 claim to be like their customers, millionaires.
“I was looking at the cars and trying to choose between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche,” said Miss Yumatova, who was grabbing her haute couture dress like a red-carpet veteran like Joan Rivers.
The show seems to be primarily aimed at the nouveau riche, the kind of Russian brand buyers willing to queue up in the corks to come to a huge warehouse where Cadillac Escalades, platinum canines, M<0xC3><0xB6>venpick ice cream, custom billiard tables, Dubai apartments and stuffed bears are on display.
The public could buy the tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
“The Russians are interested in defining the most expensive and best brands,” said Mr. Gijrath, posing proudly at the Royal Dutch Delf porcelain factory stand, in front of a handmade, blue-tiled Raimbrant wall panel.
“It’s clear that Russians are more interested in bling bling.”
Indeed, the sellers here said that Russians with old capital (10 to 15 years is too much by Russian standards) have already gone from gleaming logos to a kind of limited-edition brand that could not be sold at the show.
Despite this, thousands of people, whether millionaires, emissaries of millionaires or tourists, walk the exhibition every day.
And some even buy.
During the first night of the exhibition, last Thursday, Roman Ershow, the CEO of King Koil beds, said he sold two sets of silk, cashmere, and cotton mattresses inlaid with gold threads.
During the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, the sales director of A1 Motorcycle, a company that equips cars with state-of-the-art alarm systems, also said he sold a Russian millionaire, the bright orange Porsche, for $170,000.
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, a company that customizes luxury cars, said he would sell three bracelet-like cars, for Rolls-Royce Phantoms, at $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter the wheel of a car designed for the owner of a Russian casino, who wanted it to be inlaid with Swarovski crystals to make it look like a roulette wheel.
The set of four costs $22,000.
“The Russian millionaire who wants wheels made of ostrich leather, or a photo of his wife made of cubic zirconium, will not necessarily drive with such tires,” Karapetian said.
He will certainly keep it in his garage already containing 30 or 40 vehicles.”
Even though many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Karapetian said the phrase “Russian millionaire” is not on the agenda, given the rise in real estate prices here.
“If you had bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you would already be a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash,” he said.
“There’s more than you might think”
Those who are not millionaires can at least feel this emotion when they go to the stand of Alliance Continental, a Russian wealth management company.
The company erected four booths representing British telephone booths, filled with mass counterfeit dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing director, said his team printed 500,000 fake tickets for the Millionaire show.
Passers-by stopped to launch masses of banknotes, ask their friends to photograph them on their mobile, in the middle of this false wealth or pocketing a few million.
“You see, here in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire,” Karyev said.
Unlicensed Surgeon Suspected of Murder in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked out the window of the Just a little Healthier restaurant and observed an ambulance that had just stopped at the gates of the Cape Cod white on West Scott Avenue.
Then came the police patrol.
and then another.
“Then I saw the medical vehicle stop,” Mr. Livingston, an official at the restaurant, said Wednesday.
That's when I realized someone had died.
Authorities would later learn that the deceased was a 41-year-old woman, Olga Arroyo, assistant to the Newark Police Department director.
Investigators are now trying to determine if the cause of death is due to a gesture performed by an unlicensed cosmetic surgeon, who police have not yet identified, resident at 212 West Scott Avenue.
Authorities have not yet determined the cause of Ms. Arroyo's death, but they are confidently waiting for the results of toxicology tests that, alas, will take time, but which should help solve this mysterious death that has saddened the senior ranks of the Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo had been the assistant to Police Director Garry F. McCarthy since September 2006, and her voice was well known in various departments.
She was loyal, hard-working and tenacious,” McCarthy said of Arroyo in a telephone interview Wednesday.
“She was like a pit bull.”
“She would have done anything to protect me.”
McCarthy said Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who worked for the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission, and that she leaves two sons, ages 14 and 11, as well as a daughter-in-law.
Eileen Walsj, a spokeswoman for Union County District Attorney Theodore J. Romankow, said detectives were trying to determine if Ms. Arroyo died from unauthorized surgery.
“It’s a possibility to consider.”
“The investigation continues.”
Authorities said they arrived at her home around 3 p.m.
and have found Miss arroyo on the sofa.
She was declared dead.
A little over a week has passed since then, and authorities have not said much about the investigation or even about the owner of the house identified as Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh could not confirm whether Ms. Castro was questioned by authorities.
Investigators are trying to figure out if any part of the house was used as a doctor’s office.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Miss Castro's home where a faded rose bush rests in the narrow cemetery in front, and a Dalmatian barked in the back.
A blue can called "Ethyl Vanillin" used as a substitute for vanilla in cooking and for perfumes, lay in a hangar, next to a door that leads to the basement.
Two off-road bikes hanging on the sides.
McCarthy said that since arriving in Newark 25 years ago at the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo has been extremely valuable, helping her navigate the new city and abandon her framed political culture.
“She said, ‘You have to pay attention to this,’” he said.
“She was there when I arrived, and there when I left.
“It was embarrassing”
Everyone is hoping that the Federal Reserve will lower rates linked to the global stock market turmoil.
Shares exploded on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after the market hoped the Federal Reserve would try to calm credit conditions, subsequently lowering interest rates promoted by the soothing statements of the vice president of the US central bank.
Stock markets are exploding in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, No. 2 after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, declared that those who decide, must be “flexible and pragmatic” in their actions in the troubled financial markets.
In an obvious effort to reassure irritable markets given these new credit-related tensions, Kohn said the recent turbulence has partly “reversed some improvements in the functioning of the market at the end of September and October.
Should this severe turbulence persist, it would increase the likelihood of further tightening of financial conditions for owners and businesses, he said.
These comments appear to investors as a clear signal that the Federal Reserve is ready to inject new capital into U.S. markets, and that further declines in interest rates could stabilize credit conditions.
These remarks also calmed Wall Street with even worse news about the U.S. economy, such as the biggest drop in real estate sales for the month of October.
The repercussions of this financial turmoil have been accentuated following the statement by Bear Stearns, an investment bank, announcing that it will lay off 650 people, that is, 4% of its staff, to reduce the costs to compensate for the heavy losses due to the losing bets of real estate loans.
Only 20 jobs are planned in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 331 points, or 2.55%, to 13,289.40, while the largest index, the S&P 500, gained 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index gained 165.5 points, or 2.7%, concluding at 6306.2, adding more than <0xC2><0xA3>39 to the value of UK companies.
The German Dax index increased by 2.6% and the French CAC40 rose by 2.3%.
Previously, the reappearance of credit difficulties in the markets was highlighted by strong demand for a monthly auction of tri-funds by the European Central Bank, which cut these loans to European commercial banks at a hefty rate of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
Pressure on the Bank of England to follow the Fed and the ECB and inject further funds into London's financial markets, causing credit tensions, caused the monthly "Libor" borrowing rates of British banks, caused their highest growth since last September, to 6.59% following a strong rise since November 12.
England is facing an appeal for judgment in relation to the criticisms of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara.
We are faced with two dilemmas, one as difficult as the other.
Who will be the No. 6 drummer for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And even more important in a context as broad as the first Test against Sri Lanka, who will make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the president of the coaches who was there exceptionally to help Peter Moores, head coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, make his decision, and because the office of Hugh Morris, the CEO of England, begins to fill out the application forms to become a national coach, at least part-time.
Those who fail to win the No. 6 race will be unlucky, but life is often unfair and so is sport.
It is never easy to annihilate what allows one man to reach the top of his profession while another will never reach beyond the lower level, sometimes for lack of luck more than for lack of skill.
It is not only in cricket that selection is difficult, because in the end, judgment remains subjective.
Is now the right time to make Bopara emerge?
Is that right in relation to Shah?
The same thing could be proposed in another context, which one to choose between John Edwards or Banerjee "tubby"?; both, new executives having obtained good diplomas, professionals, should be promoted: but there is room only for one of them.
Who has the right to determine the right level of a cricketer unless he is given at least one chance?
Numbers are important in decisions, but so are opportunities.
Inside a team, a cricketer must capture the captain's eye, at the same time he must take the door and a batsman must be lucky to touch the cricketer for a day.
But capturing the eyes of the selectors is much more complicated.
Many did better last season, for example, James Anderson who seemed certain to play the first Test, even though Stephen Harmison declared himself in top form and continued to train to serve.
Anderson took 32 first-class doors over 33 laps to earn a place.
Chris Tremlett has only taken 29 to the same average, but both have already experienced their moment of glory at the highest level and hope to offer again.
Whether it will be Shah or Bopara who will play at Asgiriya Stadium is just a matter of opinion.
This choice could destroy or build a man’s career, but it makes little difference.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every Test and did well in the first, with five doors and 40 useful laps, but it was Paul Collingwood, who also struggled to emerge, who managed to become the paramount cricketer of the Test, and this, despite the fact that his double cent scored against Australia in Australia can still be underestimated.
Probability predicts that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, following another discussion after today's session at Asgiriya Stadium, will certainly follow their conservative instincts and foster Shah's greatest experiment against young Bopara's exuberance.
Both have good arguments.
In Shah’s favour, his brilliant and considerable start in the innings of the Test of 88 in Bombay, 32 cents first class against six for Bopara, who at 22 is seven years younger, and his excellent ranking at the launch.
But Shah made just ten laps in his two innings in May against the Caribbean during the Test at Lord, his home town of Middlesex, and that, the immediate rejection by the coaches when Vaughan returned to form, claimed his spot for the next game, seems to have afflicted his so obvious impulses in Bombay.
Unlike him, the player of Essex is full of joie de vivre.
Nothing scares him on a cricket pitch and he overreacted when he recently crashed into a 4x4 during a presentation by Volkswagen, England’s sponsor.
He reported only minor injuries, was shocked, even though the first thing he did was to take his Vodafone (sponsor of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who was looking at him from a distance, to ask him if "'he had seen this?'"
Bopara is by far the best drummer, his sharp look allows him to do services that suit him, and that he beats with confidence and professionalism.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Could this be the true art of selection?
I'd be happy to give Bopara a chance, which doesn't mean Shah shouldn't apply if, as the tea leaves suggest, he's the one playing this weekend.
Buses take people back to work, and to fight al Qaeda.
The first bus full of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, dumping these exiles without money or visa renewals, or others who hope the city has returned to normal.
Some have returned to fight against the militants who have driven them from their homes.
At Mansour bus station, even before Damascus arrived 800 people transported in convoys of dozens of official government buses, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who returned by their own means.
“I decided to go to Syria after they killed several doctors in Baghdad,” said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
“I came back today because I saw on TV and read in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and saw that the city is safer now.”
“They say the Mahdi army is no longer committing crimes!” he said, referring to the Shia militia of clerical activist Moqtada al-Sadr, who has forced his men to move away for the time being.
Qassim al-Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher from the Sunni-dominated Amariyah area, returned with his two children because he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and because the regime is preventing Iraqis from working.
Shia's neighbors in Amariyah called him to inform him that the U.S.-assisted militia, allowed Al Qaeda to be driven out of the western capital, and invited him to return.
One of Jordan’s newcomers is the leader of a Sunni and Shia tribe who had to leave his home north of Baghdad because of a grenade attack after he incited citizens to rebel against Al-Qaeda.
But he had to go home to fight.
“Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me they had set up an anti-Al Qaeda militia in Sleikh, and they needed me and my boys.”
“That’s why I’m coming back today,” said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many say they have been drawn to the growing calm of the capital since U.S. troops arrived, and to the view of continuing training of well-armed “involved citizen groups” working with the U.S. military to defend their neighborhood.
But still others say they have been forced to return because of the visa problem and the decadence of the capital of Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in the past years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51, a father of three, expressed the suspicion felt by all about the exile visas that Nuri al-Maliki, the Shia prime minister, allegedly asked the Syrian government to limit to force people to return to the country.
More than two and a half million people are reported to have fled the country because of sectarian death squads.
"We had no problem until al-Maliki came to Syria and urged the government to stop giving Iraqis visas, to force them to return to Iraq," he said.
“I can’t trust a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house when I left.”
The drop in violence can be partly explained by the fact that Sunnis have been driven out of Shia areas and vice versa, creating places where tensions are lower.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will once again increase sectarian tensions and bring the fighting back.
Little Saar, good training.
The smallest state leads in vocational training, and even shines by the international orientation of its higher schools.
It is only in one area that a deficit weighs on the Sarrois, similar to that of the rest of the country.
"I explained yesterday for the 50th time to a non Sarrois, that we are not French" - this is the slogan that the smallest federated state, by self-deprecation, displays for its 50th anniversary.
At this level, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Saar training system, which is placed fifth in the training monitor of the German Institute of Economics in Cologne.
Thus, already by tradition, the higher schools cooperate closely with neighboring countries.
The university was founded in Saarbr<0xC3><0xBC>cken in 1948 by the French.
To date, students have the opportunity to complete their studies with a double or even a triple degree.
This is reflected in the high proportion of 15.6 per cent of foreign students.
The Saarland also leads the country's children to higher schools in greater than average numbers - many of them without a diploma from the Gymnasium.
"In Saarland, we take advantage of the vocational training system," says Axel Pl<0xC3><0xBC>nnecke, a training expert at IW.
More than one in five young people obtain their degree in a vocational school, so the Saar is more than seven points above the national average.
Also the possibilities of combining a professional and academic training are relatively well developed.
In view of the number of inhabitants, the dual degree panel is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and growing demand, the number of engineering graduates has dropped by a third in recent years.
This is why the Saarland Ministry of Education has obliged the higher schools to a marketing campaign in the engineering sciences subjects.
"After the first PISA studies, we celebrated a large number of reforms in the general schools," says a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government has introduced comparison tests throughout the federated state.
In order for children to start learning earlier, the last year of kindergarten is exempt from law - a model that meanwhile other federated states also copy.
Only future comparison studies will be able to show whether student performance improves in a sustainable way.
In the 2003 PISA studies, the proportion of students at risk decreased from 29 to 20 per cent.
In total, however, the Saarland has not improved as much as other federal states.
Bavarians are doing better.
And in spite of the Saarland, foreign language proficiency is not measured by PISA studies - one could otherwise earn points in this field.
Because the language of the neighbor is mandatory in high schools - even if the Sarrois are not French.
Chavez sets the clock
In Venezuela, watches will soon tick differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chavez will raise the half-hour timer in the South American country.
In the meantime, Chavez has become a caricature in Spain.
As the official newspaper of Venezuela reported, due to a new law, watches will be set to less than four and a half hours of universal time.
In this way, the South American country gets a time zone that does not exist in any other state in the world.
The anti-American Chavez justified his position among other things by the fact that the United States would have imposed on the world the separation of time zones in full hours.
In addition, Chavez announced Wednesday (local time) the termination of relations with the neighboring country, Colombia, due to a hostage situation.
The left-wing nationalist announced that as long as conservative Alvaro Uribe remained president of Colombia, he would not have relations with either the head of state or the Colombian government.
“I can’t do it, already only because of my dignity,” said Chavez, who hastened a constitutional reform on which the citizens of the oil country will have to vote by referendum on Sunday.
With this reform, he would significantly strengthen his power in the country.
The trigger for this dispute was Uribe’s decision to withdraw from Chávez the mandate for negotiations on the release of hostages with the Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe allegedly "spit in the face" of Venezuela with this decision, criticized Chavez on Sunday.
In Spain, too, Chavez is in every mouth.
A new mobile phone ringtone is raging in the country: "Why don't you shut up" (why don't you shut up) is the phrase that already more than half a million people have downloaded on the internet.
It was delivered by the King of Spain Juan Carlos who, at the most recent Ibero-American summit, was annoyed by the constant questioning of left-wing populists and who told him to be silent.
A drop in wages threatens Germany in 2007.
Despite the strong economic situation, according to a forecast, a real loss in the value of wages threatens German employees this year.
Experts have cited all sorts of reasons to explain their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation by the Hans-B<0xC3><0xB6>ckler Foundation, employees should expect a real reduction in their payroll in 2007 compared to the previous year.
"The fault lies with the low wage development, the increase in the Value Added Tax and the rises in food and energy prices," Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research told the Bild newspaper.
There may also be new charges for unemployment insurance for the employee.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbr<0xC3><0xBC>ck told the newspaper "Neue Osnabr<0xC3><0xBC>cker Zeitung" that the planned reduction in unemployment insurance of 3.3 per cent for the new year was certainly correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the National Employment Agency no longer has the right to be embarrassed to ask the Federation for credits or financial aid, in the words of the SPD politician.
We learned on Tuesday that the explosion in food and oil prices has pushed inflation to its highest level in 13 years.
In total, prices increased by 3.0 per cent from one year to the next.
Venus is the infernal twin of Earth.
Despite its hostile atmosphere to life, Venus is more Earth-like than previously thought: Europe's Venus Express space probe has discovered lightning bolts in the atmosphere and wind whirls at the poles, similar to those that appear in winter on Earth.
For nearly three decades, scientists have assumed that there are lightning strikes on Venus.
The European probe "Venus Express" has today provided proof of this - it has detected electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: the flashes on Venus burst at a height of about 56 kilometers from cloud to cloud, reports Christopher Russel of the University of California in Los Angeles in the scientific magazine "Nature".
According to the famous theory of the cyprine, lightning would have caused the appearance of life on Earth: the storm would have stimulated reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, the cornerstone of life.
“If there was life, it must have been at a very early date in history,” says Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
There should be hardly any living things on the surface of Venus today: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, sometimes with temperatures of 500 degrees.
"Venus may be Earth's infernal twin, but she's still a twin," Russell said.
Why Venus, which looks so much like Earth in mass and dimensions, has been struck with such a different evolution, is the fundamental question of the ASE mission.
The departure of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was an important step in Venusian research, since no probes were on the way to explore this planet since the nineties.
In the opinion of the researchers, the most recent research results that have now been presented in several papers of "Nature" do not only emphasize the singularity of Venus within the solar system.
They also show that the points in common with the Earth of our neighboring planet are more numerous than initially assumed.
So the researchers found, in addition to the wind whirlpools already known at the north pole, a cloud whirlpool at the south pole, which rotates even faster.
The phenomenon recalls air currents in the terrestrial hemispheres in winter, writes a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second planet in the solar system has almost the same mass as Earth and is, with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers, almost as large.
The planet known as the evening or morning star revolves around the sun in just 225 days.
However, it rotates much more slowly on itself: a Venusian day lasts 243 Earth days.
Although Venus, with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, hardly resembles Earth, scientists assume that the two planets formed under similar conditions.
On both, water accumulated and remained on Earth in the form of oceans, but got lost in space on Venus.
And while carbon dioxide has settled on Earth as carbonate, it makes up most of the atmosphere on Venus.
K<0xC3><0xB6>hler defends Merkel’s meeting with the Dalai Lama.
The President of the Federal Republic of Germany K<0xC3><0xB6>hler demands an end to the dispute between the parties over the reception of the Dalai Lama at the Chancellery.
Indirectly, he criticized the SPD for attacks on the chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst K<0xC3><0xB6>hler cares about Germany's appearance and calls on the grand coalition to end the feud over the Dalai Lama's reception.
“We must not present to the outside world a divided nation on this issue,” K<0xC3><0xB6>hler told the Handelsblatt.
At the same time, K<0xC3><0xB6>hler showed understanding for the reception of the Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights have universal validity, even if I have respect for differences between cultures," said K<0xC3><0xB6>hler.
Everyone knows that Germany should maintain a sensitive balance in terms of foreign policy, stressed the President of the Federal Republic, but defended Merkel against the accusations that she would organize a new policy of China.
The German chancellor has not distanced herself from the traditional one-China policy.
“China knows it too,” K<0xC3><0xB6>hler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) had indirectly voiced his dissatisfaction with the Dalai Lama's reception and had been attacked for doing so outside the ranks of the CDU.
Steinmeier had complained in particular about the "front-line policy" of the CDU in terms of foreign policy.
After the reception of the Dalai Lama at the Chancellery, virulent irritations were felt in the German-Chinese relations.
Thus the Chinese government has not only fired the German Finance Minister Peer Steinbr<0xC3><0xBC>ck (SPD), but according to information from Spiegel, has also frozen the so-called dialogue strategy of the foreign ministers of the two countries.
Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao is now demanding that German Chancellor Angela Merkel recognize that welcoming the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China refuses to allow European politicians to receive Tibet’s spiritual leader in his official capacity, Wen Jiabao said.
The Dalai Lama’s words and deeds would show that he is trying to separate Tibet and other Tibetan regions from China, which also includes other provinces today.
Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble warns against riots like those in France.
Street fights with the police, shootings, cars on fire: Wolfgang Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble warns against riots like those in France.
Everything must be done so that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not break out in the streets through violence, the German Interior Minister demanded.
Burning barricades, thugs shooting at police with shotguns: after the serious youth riots in France, German Interior Minister Wolfgang Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
We must ensure that a social explosive is not also formed at home and defused into violence.
We have to take this seriously," he told the "Neue Presse" newspaper in Hanover.
Not all young people would be able to cope with the rapid changes in social reality.
The Federation, the federated states and the communes were already working hard to reduce the problems, Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble said.
This would not only affect the integration of immigrants.
"From integration summits to conferences on Islam, this is already showing its early successes."
But it would be too early for an end to the warning.
Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble points out at the same time that in the German suburbs, there are no sociological problems neither from the point of view of urban planning as in France.
In the northern Parisian agglomerations, young people had engaged in serious street battles with the police during the last few nights.
In Toulouse too, cars and public buildings burned.
Greater efforts at integration on the part of the German government were demanded by the President of the Turkish communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In view of the riots in France, Kolat warned of "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany would certainly not be as explosive as in France.
However, there would still be a need for action.
Kolat emphasizes that the unemployment quota among young people under 25 years of age from immigration would be higher than average.
Above all, more places should be provided for training.
Kolat insisted: “We need to give young people a perspective.”
The President of the Turkish communities added, however, that social control in families took place more in Germany than in France.
Many young people from immigrant backgrounds also do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat exhorted: "But we must still be careful."
It should be "quick to give young people the opportunity to participate in work and training".
Meanwhile, in the Parisian suburb of Villiers-le-Bel, everything remained very quiet during the night.
Police units were in place, a helicopter was hovering over the area with searchlights.
The authorities in charge reported three arrests as well as a few burned cars and trash cans.
Since the conference, a deployment of about 1,000 security forces has ensured calm.
The police will intervene as long as necessary, announced the Minister of the Interior Michelle Alliot-Marie, after a visit to the suburb.
On Tuesday night, nearly 80 police officers were injured during the riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The following night, riots broke out in Toulouse.
The riots broke out after a traffic accident in which two young people had lost their lives on Sunday.
According to the first elements of the Prosecutor's Office, the police are not responsible for the death of young people.
In the empire of Angela Merkel.
The chancellor’s utopian entry shows that the coalition is done with the bottom – and that there is nothing more to expect from her.
What country does this Chancellor live in?
After his bleak intervention in the general debates of the German Parliament, which was chaotic and poor in content, it must be said: not here - not in the country which should, in the end, be governed by it.
The reproach of focusing too much on politics was rejected by Angela Merkel from a harsh and presumptuous sentence.
It is provincial, she said, and has only shown that she does not want to understand what the critics want.
In Parliament, she made it clear to everyone how accurate this reproach was.
There was neither concrete interest nor little feeling for the country's problems to be felt.
Instead, Angela presented herself as a cloud: a weightless politician, who flees into foreign policy and even there remains in the near future.
For example, climate protection: in this regard, it welcomes again and again the Heiligendam agreements, but does not say how the climate goals will have to be achieved in our country.
Even self-praise - to have so little modesty, the CDU leader would have refused it again two years ago.
Now she is clinging to ready-made formulas, that growth would affect people.
By doing so she destroys her image as a pragmatist, who solves problems instead of beautifying the world.
But in the Angela cloud empire, domestic policy issues are a marginal phenomenon.
Child poverty and the concerns of low-wage workers?
There are a few accessory phrases for that.
In this matter, it is revealing the number of times it makes lapses when it comes to family allowance.
Here, Merkel needs three starts to pronounce a sentence half accurate.
She hesitates in unknown territory, from the moment it becomes concrete.
The Attack Branch
In the YouTube debate of Republican presidential candidates, the two frontrunners Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney engage in a hard-fought offensive battle – and must now fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of the candidates already erupts on the first topic.
He would have made New York a “refuge for illegals,” Mitt Romney reproaches his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
Giuliani counters this with heavy criticisms: "I would say that his own house was a haven for illegal immigrants," Giuliani replies and reproaches the former governor of Massachusetts for having employed undocumented immigrants.
The candidates rise to the attack: as the Republican base also has no official favorites, the eight presidential candidates use the debates on CNN above all to discredit their opponents.
The 30-second amateur movies that Internet users have sent over YouTube are barely more than blowers.
“It’s with this kind of isolationism that we let Hitler come to power,” McCain told his candidate Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round to call for an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney is also being lectured vigorously by Vietnam veterans, when he refuses to condemn as torture what is called "Waterboarding", a method of interrogation where one simulates drowning.
However, the fact that the important themes of the campaign in the meantime go beyond the war in Iraq and the debates on torture is seen in the reactions of the common room in St. Petersburg, Florida.
Whether conservative values are praised or future tax increases are denied, applause is pouring into the auditorium.
This is where the weaknesses of the two favourites are revealed once again.
"I made a mistake at that time," Romney said in a statement, apologizing to the public and the public for being a pro-abortion activist in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, slips into a knot when asked for his opinion on literal interpretations of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns for the first time in civilian life.
A day after he stepped down as army chief, Pakistan’s Musharraf was sworn in as president.
Thus eight years of domination by the army ended.
Pakistan’s President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in on Thursday for a new five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live at the presidential palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to respect the Constitution and act for the well-being of the nation.
On Wednesday, he handed over his post as army chief to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and bowed to international pressure, including from the United States.
Eight years after his seizure of power by a bloodless coup, the former general now reigns for the first time as head of the Civil Registry.
By this withdrawal from the post of commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had fulfilled the main demand of the opposition and the West.
Another central demand is the end of the state of emergency that Musharraf had declared on November 3.
Already shortly after his inauguration Musharraf will suspend the state of emergency, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, and thus fulfill another requirement of the West.
The country's Supreme Court, which Musharraf had occupied after a state of emergency was imposed with lawyers from his ranks, last week rejected all appeals against the controversial re-election of the head of state on 6 October.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed in the northern tribal region of North Waziristan in an attack on a military convoy, and four others were wounded.
According to the army spokesman, a bomb exploded in a street near the Afghan border.
The Krautrock Fathers are back.
The supergroups of Germany of the seventies are playing again: the three members of the group Harmonia once again took their console in a concert in Berlin.
For their return were released recordings of their great success "Live 1974".
Already at that time, they were much better known abroad.
The expected sensation then occurs in the form of three gentlemen announced on the evening bill.
Everyone has his little box in front of him, his cable and above all his buttons.
Dieter Moebius, 63, sits in the middle in a snow-white shirt.
He is flanked on the left by Michael Rother, a 57-year-old with a laptop and a guitar.
On the right, observed by the entire auditorium, 73-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius leans over his console.
Everyone contributes to the noise, including a beat.
And sometimes it inadvertently adds to a piece of traditional music.
This does not seem to bother the gentlemen themselves.
The fact that the band Harmonia is playing again has ensured some excitement among Krautrock fans.
We have the right to reveal it here: targeted polls reveal that, certainly, the name reasons in the collective memory of pop, but in no case in such a lasting way that this group is so painfully missing for 32 years.
But why wouldn’t the German also have the right to celebrate his living legends of the seventies?
Especially since what is deceptively called "Krautrock" has always rained more in England and America than in the country of origin.
When the music industry awarded the 2003 Echo Award to the survivors of the Cologne band Can for their work, we saw in the room the interrogative German pop faces.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the groups La D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf and Neu! in the panegyric praise, the astonishment had no limits.
Later, during the concerts, Michael Rother jumped onto the Red Hot Chili Peppers stage as an old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and transfiguration into the unknown is the only one.
The memory is therefore already taken by Harmonia, because the trio only existed for two years and that during this period, the power of impact that was felt was much lower than what was attributed to it later by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously played with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising name Cluster.
They first played in the cellars below the Berlin stage.
Then in D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf, for a label subsidized by the church, for financial reasons.
Rother had briefly worked through Kraftwerk and had finally made a name for himself as a guitarist with Neu!, which was at the time perhaps the most radical German band.
Around 1973, however, Rother followed the musicians of Cluster into exile in the forests of Weserbergland.
There, on an old farm in the Weser, a 16th-century ruin, they lived as members of communities fleeing the city.
Less ideological than in the "Kommune I" community, where Roedelius had the right to be tormented as a nurse.
Rather an artistic existence in the manner of Spitzweg.
Allegedly in the trash was a pennant of the Harmonia Ottenstein choir and also a name for art.
Many held Harmonia away from that.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia", and the next "De Luxe".
Because as serene and modest as the music sounded, the group suffered from material misery.
The harvest of dead wood was not for self-seeking alone.
The CD "Live 1974" that has just been released was recorded during a concert in Griessem in front of a record audience of almost 50 heads, as someone believes to remember.
Rother issued at that time the wish to force Harmonia to train from time to time.
For Roedelius and Moebius this was an immoral demand.
The group announced its separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the spheres of esotericism and ensured its existence with albums like "Flammende Herzen" (hearts on fire).
Cluster revived in the 1980s and has since been more successful than Harmonia ever had.
We owe Griessem's Live album to Herbert Gr<0xC3><0xB6>nemeyer.
His label Gr<0xC3><0xB6>nland set itself the goal of maintaining Krautrock as an inherent German contribution to contemporary music.
Neu! had already been unearthed on this occasion as the personal work of Roedelius.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
Publicly funded, as part of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is there, the British, former punk and author of the paperback book "Krautrock Sampler".
There's also the inventor of the Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
By which the entire margin of fluctuation of Krautrock's influence would be identified with respect to future pop music.
The place left empty by the group will be filled by Harmonia.
Brian Eno’s phrase hovers in the room amid the singular sounds: “The only real music, you listen to the future.”
There are photos that show the producers with Harmonia in the farm room.
Projections of other black-and-white photos of wired bazaar tools serve to form the legend.
In front, the three veterans are again busy improvising.
But more by sticking microphones to the organ and drums, to shoot at the instruments unheard of sounds thanks to the self-built effects instruments.
Today, electronic music is similar to electronic music.
All three are great techies.
Even the house choir won't change that.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, one coughs and whispers under the cloud of sounds, and one sings at a nice moment "Aaaaaaaah" with emphasis.
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
It was never about rock.
The roots have been less sought in the blues than in music conservatories (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or in the escape from artistic or social conventions (Cluster).
The one who shouts "68" is not totally wrong, and Harmonia also does not let herself be irritated by this anymore.
But what is most self-evident will be thoroughly covered on the stage.
Where does music begin and end?
This can knock on someone's nerves (?) or grant fleeting moments of great joy.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough.
With "The Hunting Party" and "Murderous Peace", two films deal again with the Balkan war.
But both do not convince.
Either the projects rely too much on action and on the exchanges of senseless shots or on the contrary they are too tearful.
Here, even Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help.
The good news first: while war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, it is precisely there, in the most gloomy hinterland of the Bosnian war, that actor Richard Gere is found.
We had ultimately lost sight of the most beautiful man of the eighties, because far too many nice, frivolous roles in women’s sentimental films and far too many press conferences on the subject of Buddhism delighted him with the desire to show himself.
Today Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument for still watching "The Hunting Party" - when the hunter becomes the hunted (why should today's movies be as long and confusing as collective agreements of locomotive drivers?)
He delivers a magnificent representation full of winks: in the background, his character of war reporter Simon Hunt is what Gere could have become, if fate and the film industry were not so benevolent: a man who has his best moments in a long time behind him, but who, even as a crumbling monument to his decline, has nevertheless kept visible remnants of his former charm.
But despite this asset, "The Hunting Party" continues together with the German production "Murderous Peace", which also comes out this week, the endless series of failed films on the Balkan war.
The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who rescue a Serbian girl from the Kosovar snipers, in which one of the two quickly falls in love.
Although it is welcome that here the Serbs are not for once presented as the only causes of all evil, this film as flat as a television movie is lost far too quickly in the action and the exchanges of senseless shots.
This remains a kind of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without highway but with a war instead.
On the contrary, we can examine in the perfect example of "The Hunting Party", why in the end there has never been a real good film about the Balkan war.
The story of the three American war reporters, who are conditioning themselves to track down the top war criminal “the fox”, could perhaps have become, with another director and another screenwriter (both at the same time Richard Shepard), at another time a new “Apocalypse Now”.
Because the stories are strikingly similar: two males go in a small team in the forest, to accomplish something that the military can not do and for both males, it becomes a journey into madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that we simply do not let Simon Hunt be the deserted cynic with a heart, as he is presented to us at the beginning.
No, the script must also attribute him a romantic adventure with a Bosniak murdered later.
Then "The Hunting Party" becomes definitively bad, when the reporter, in the space of the last five minutes, by an accelerated process, manages to what NATO, the CIA and all the bounty hunters of the world have not succeeded in five years: to catch the war criminal and leave him for a just revenge to the Muslim Bosniaks.
It is so bad that one should turn to the International Court of the Hague for a crime against cinematographic logic.
In this case, the film has too deep a human concern.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still at large, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here they must exceptionally agree) not to conduct the hunt intensive enough due to secret political agreements.
But the well-intentioned and the wicked are this time so similar that a famous poem by Brecht comes to mind.
He speaks of a wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's work table: "Compassionate, I see the veins of the forehead swollen, clearly: how tiring it is to be wicked."
Movies like "The Hunting Party" have exactly such tumescent heads, but that insinuate how tiring it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the kind of films about the Balkan war.
Recently, it was reported in this newspaper that all Hollywood movies about Iraq were big flops.
We can add: there has never been a good film about South Africa.
Which is true every time: when a star hangs out on a hotbed of crisis or a minefield, he then comes out with something like “Rangoon” with Patricia Arquette, “Jenseits aller Grenzen” with Angelina Jolie or “Blutdiamanten” with Leonardo DiCaprio.
It is possible that all these conflicts are still simply too close in time.
Anyway, it's still decades before Hollywood can make a good Holocaust movie with Schindler's List.
Some films have yet to mature - those that are now considered classic works on Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jacket" were by no means unanimously celebrated in their time as masterpieces.
But perhaps we know too much today about the conflicts of the world, where each massacre arrives live on two screens at the same time at home,
And it delighted the writers with the lack of scruples they need to tell beautiful stories.
“To be or not to be” or “The Dictator” actually became as good as well because Lubtisch and Chaplin didn’t yet know how much the Nazi regime really dominated.
Maybe you don't want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Perhaps we should have the sarcastic and distant artistic gaze of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel "Lempri<0xC3><0xA8>re's Dictionary" and the Balkan War, he replied: "It's only because some things never change."
“The big cities will always be horribly dangerous, men will always be murdered in a horrifying way, and war will always reign in Yugoslavia.”
Von Beust has been criticized for cancelling the Olympics.
The mayor's backsliding from Hamburg's bid for the Summer Olympics has clashed in politics and the economy with virulent criticism.
Many want to continue fighting for the Games on the waterfront.
But Von Beust calls for realism in the appreciation of opportunities.
The senior director of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-J<0xC3><0xB6>rg Schmidt-Trenz, on Wednesday described the dropout as "bad for the local economy".
In recent times, no other project had deployed as much motivational forces in the city as the idea of the Olympics.
“Without this objective, the political-sports momentum could not have been maintained in the same measures.”
Schmidt-Trenz invites the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new starting point for it in the longer term, "which takes as a starting point another modified agenda".
Mayor Ole von Beust on Wednesday stuck to his previous statements that Hamburg’s Olympic ambitions were unrealistic until at least 2028.
"It is not Hamburg that decides on a bid for the Olympics, but the German Olympic Sports Federation," Von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
It refers to the expected decision of the Sports Federation at the beginning of December, about the candidacy of Munich for the 2018 Winter Games.
This preference means for us, that in the time frame we had planned until 2028 so far, we will have no chance.”
However, the dream does not belong definitively to the past, Von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regretted Beust’s statements.
From this the impression would be given that Hamburg no longer wants to apply for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It is too early to close an opportunity, burying the projects already now," said Wednesday the president of the HSB G<0xC3><0xBC>nter Plo<0xC3><0x9F>.
An abandonment of the candidature would also be at odds with the statements made by the head of the Senate on the occasion of the opening of the plenary session of the German Federation of Higher Sports Schools.
There, Von Beust reportedly called Hamburg's bid for the 2015 Universiade "not a substitute" for the Olympics in Hamburg.
The Federation of Higher Schools of Sport had first in recent weeks named Hamburg as a candidate city.
The SPD faction of the mayor has criticized the Senate for not having used this precious time in the construction of housing in Hamburg.
“The development of Little Grasbrook was denied by the Senate for years because it played the Olympiad card and excluded the construction of housing,” said SPD delegates Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has always demanded for Petit Grasbrook an integrated plan in the Olympics and a subsequent use of housing, the CDU would have relied exclusively on the "Event factor".
The bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics in Hamburg is said to have aroused great enthusiasm.
Hamburg had, however, broken up against Leipzig.
These aren't Warhols' crates.
The one who connects the concepts Sweden and wooden case, thinks of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
At the moment, wooden crates made in Sweden cast shadows on the list of Warhol’s works.
A large part of the ninety Brillo-Boxes of "Type Stockholm" listed there are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" questioned a few months ago the authenticity of the Brillo-Boxes of the year 1968 of Andy Warhol, the internal research of the Moderna Museet of Stockholm today lead to a disenchanting result: the six "Brillo-Boxes are so others", whose great director of the museum Pontus Hulten gave in 1995 to the Moderna Brine Muset.
The ancient history is entangled, a disconcerting sequence of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol created in New York his first "Brillo-Boxes", painted wooden boxes, which are based on the red-blue-white design of the "Brillo" powder soap boxes.
An exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet presented in 1968 - with Warhol's agreement - hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard: These did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but had been delivered directly from the Brillo cardboard factory.
These were not works of art, but rather their models, exhibition samples.
At the same time, Warhol had given permission in 1968 to have some Brillo wooden cases produced in Sweden, which were not exhibited at the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses of the time speak today of about fifteen wooden crates that at the time would have entered by right into the history of art and auctions, as original Brillo-Boxes of Andy Warhol authorized, with the appellation "Stockholm Type".
Some of them reached in auctions more than 100,000 dollars.
The problem now is that the legendary director of the Pontus Hultén museum claimed, wrongly, later that about a hundred wooden crates had been produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol would later cede to him.
In truth, Hultén’s 105 cases were produced in Malm<0xC3><0xB6> in 1990 alone, for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By that time, Warhol had already been dead for three years.
Lars Bystr<0xC3><0xB6>m, Chief Curator of the Moderna Museet, next to the museum's six Brillo-Boxes, examined three others from Swedish private collections, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their laminated panels were first printed and sanded, then applied with a brush of white oil paint.
The texture of the copies dating from 1990 reveals, on the contrary, that the paint was directly applied without a bottom layer on the laminated panels, using a paint roller - moreover it is not an oil paint, but an acrylic.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo-Boxes," suggests the director of the Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' exhibition in New York does not come up with another decision, the Moderna Museet collection will classify the six boxes as a copy."
As early as July, the Authentication Board announced, of course, that it would investigate the "heavy charges" that will be raised in the case of the boxes of soap powder.
But since then there has been an inexorable silence.
Rebel Soldiers in Manila Abandoned
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers are leaving, the same ones who had holed up in a hotel in Manila, and who had demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and electoral fraud, told reporters at the hotel that he could not be held responsible for any bloodshed.
The soldiers loyal to the government had shortly before stormed the hotel with tear gas.
The two dozen soldiers had been holed up in the building for hours.
About half of them were standing before the courts on Wednesday because of a failed coup attempt in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He took advantage of the audience to suddenly get away with about 30 sympathizers.
The military police, who were normally supposed to be watching them, had apparently deserted in his favour and joined his mutiny.
They broke into the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the removal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
The loyal troops in power cordoned off the area around the respectable hotel.
The President convened an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
National Security Advisor Norberto Gonzales condemned the soldiers' actions.
"People have had enough," Trillanes said.
“We call on people to join us.”
Gen. Danilo Lim, who commanded the elite Scout Ranger unit, said other army units soon wanted to join the march.
Critics of the regime had called for a large demonstration against the president on Wednesday.
His government has been surrounded for months by accusations of corruption.
The financial district of Manila was already since 2003 the scene of the attempted mutiny of about 200 members of the army against Arroyo.
The insurgency broke down nearly 24 hours after the army refused to join.
Since 1986 there have been at least seven attempted coups against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a principal shareholder of Versatel.
United Internet has secured a stake of more than 20 percent in telecommunications company Versatel.
The average price per share is 14.46 euros, as reported by the company on Wednesday.
Only 20.05 per cent of the share capital would be held.
We had already speculated before about a buyout.
The option would remain open to further increase the stake in Versatel.
With this step we seek to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet has communicated.
Just before, assumptions had already been made Wednesday about an entry, after the Berenberg bank increased its stake in the D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf network operator from 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The credit institute would only hold the money for a third part, it is said on the market.
The day before, United Internet had already acquired a nearly 10 percent stake in mobile phone company Drillisch.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch listed 17.4 million new shares worth 106.4 million euros.
United Internet bought 5.15 million for 31.1 million euros.
In addition, the companies have entered into negotiations on co-operation in the marketing of DSL and mobile telephony products.
"We are strengthening our partnership," a United Internet spokesman said.
The two companies founded the joint venture MSP in order to absorb competitor Freenet.
At the moment, the two companies want to be satisfied with their ten percent stake in Freenet, and not make use of their right to endorse an additional 18.49 percent at Freenet, United Internet said Thursday.
The two companies would, however, leave all options open, especially to increase the stake in Freenet SA, it was learned.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership ended in mid-October.
The still difficult-to-predict poker on Freenet that has been going on for months is part of the consolidation of the German telecom market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million mobile contract customers and 1.27 million DSL and full subscription customers.
The Holding of United Internet and Drillisch had until now a direct stake in Freenet of 6.01 percent.
It was now agreed that Drillisch would contribute about four percent more.
The right to buy the 18.49 percent from investment firm Vatas had already been decided in August.
