A Republican strategy to counter Obama’s re-election
Republican leaders justified their policies by the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter a myth, claiming that electoral fraud is rarer in the United States than the number of people killed by lightning.
In fact, Republican lawyers have only documented 300 cases of election fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
It is in this spirit that a majority of U.S. governments enacted new laws starting in 2009 making the registration or voting process more difficult.
This phenomenon gained momentum after the November 2010 elections, which saw the addition of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 draft laws restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states were introduced in 2011 alone.
The new election laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws also reduce advance polling periods, invalidate the right to register as an elector on polling day, and remove the right to vote from citizens with a judicial record.
Prior to the 2006 election, no U.S. state required voters to present a photo ID.
Indiana was the first state to make such a requirement.
In 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld Indiana’s constitutionality.
The republican authorities hastened to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they sponsored bills in 34 states to force voters to present a photo ID.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal identity card such as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11 percent of U.S. citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, do not have photo ID cards issued by a government agency in their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such identification.
However, it often costs more than a hundred dollars to obtain the required identity card.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities, and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over 65, and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 do not have the required photo ID.
A lot more.
Students, voters considered to be voting more for Democratic candidates, are not allowed in several states to use their photo ID card issued by their institution.
On the other hand, these same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote more on the Republican side to use the cards issued by these clubs to vote.
Prior to 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to make such a claim.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Hispanic vote.
It appears that two out of three Hispanic voters favor the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers sponsored laws in 2011 abolishing voter registration on polling day in eight states.
In addition, they limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to electors wishing to register.
These restrictions are not inconsequential.
For example, in the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns helped register about 10 million citizens.
However, the measures adopted since 2009 have led to a 17% drop in the registration rate of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers have passed laws in five other states aimed at reducing the advance voting period.
For example, in the 2008 Florida general election, 33% of early voters were African-American, while the latter accounted for only 13% of the state’s voters.
It was the same with Hispanics.
These represented only 11% of voters, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance.
In contrast, whites who made up 76% of voters accounted for only 46% of early voting voters.
Of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters have strongly opposed the passage of laws restricting voter registration.
Several bills have been blocked by vetoes from Democratic governors.
The U.S. Attorney General stepped in to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states have laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID.
Nevertheless, the new rules put in place will undeniably make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan character of the laws that have been passed and they see it as an obvious goal to influence the results in 2012 in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that the states that passed these laws accounted for 171 of the 270 votes needed for the electoral college to win the presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate Cancer Screening: Passing the Test or Not?
Indeed, the PSA test would sometimes present erroneous results, with false negative results or false positives, which lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
Which makes even more hesitant men already reluctant to pass screening tests.
Pass the test or not?
We asked for the opinion of two specialists.
In the studies conducted in the United States, there was a lot of contamination between the control groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and have firm recommendations.
Another study, the European one, concluded that there was a difference in mortality between patients who were screened and those who were not screened.
This study also showed, with follow-up after 12 years, that one is between 30 and 40% more likely to have metastases if one is not screened.
I therefore recommend the test from the age of 50, or from the age of 40 if you have a direct relative who has already had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American descent are also more at risk.
The key is to make the right decision once a cancer has been detected.
There are aggressive cancers and others that are indolent.
There is a real need to make the patient understand the degree of risk of his cancer, by offering him the possible options, by not necessarily treating prostate cancers that do not affect long-term life, and by opting instead, in these cases, for active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men in whom cancer is detected will not be treated, because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
We're going to suggest active surveillance, and if the disease progresses, we're going to offer them treatment.
Increasingly, there are precise criteria for deciding who should and should not be treated.
I recommend taking the test anyway.
But the important thing is to have a discussion with your doctor to determine whether you should pass it or not.
In collaboration with the International Society of Urology, Movember has created a tool to assess the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite advances in research, adopting good lifestyle habits remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering from them.
It is estimated that if everyone ate well and moved enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
"If no one smoked, the rate would rise to at least 50 percent," said André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
On the other hand, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Many are also completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority, despite the reduction in the number of smokers.
Cigarette smoking is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for many others.
It does a lot of harm to people’s health.
"Even today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," said spokesman André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer drops by half.
The weight
Overweight and obesity also promote the onset of the disease, according to the CCS.
They would increase the risks of cancer of the breast, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
“Research shows that regular physical activity over a lifetime protects against colon cancer.”
The food
The body also recommends limiting your consumption of red meat.
Too much of it increases the risk of developing colorectal cancer.
Meatballs, too, and they should be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"These can damage the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer," he said.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their research is not conclusive at this time.
Studies on vitamin E are conflicting, according to the CCS.
While one of them saw a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, another noted an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is also unclear.
Mr. Beaulieu also stressed the importance of discussing his concerns and family history with his doctor.
"Getting screened doesn't give cancer."
The shelled Higgs boson
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson created quite a stir, last summer, and for good reason.
Indeed, it is believed that this boson participates in the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the Universe, just that.
And then, this is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or "less worst" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - but which has not yet been observed empirically.
But for physicists, it is not yet completely certain that it is the Higgs.
We know beyond a shadow of a doubt that we are holding an authentic new particle, and that it looks very much like the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, new data unveiled this week at a major physics conference in Kyoto seem to confirm this, but there is still a lack of data to be completely certain.
Let’s assume it’s the Higgs anyway, since the chances of getting it wrong seem slim, and let’s see what it’s all about.
There is, in this low world, a fatally inescapable law that two things cannot be in the same place at the same time.
No way to break this rule - and don't try too hard, you're going to hurt yourself.
Even if particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that it also has a law of this kind: the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" consisting roughly of some of their characteristics.
From there, physicists classify particles into two categories.
In one corner there are good citizens named fermions, who wisely obey the principle of Pauli.
And in the other are the bosons, a dirty bunch of anarchists who have no respect for anything - at least not for this principle, which means they can be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons then divide into two groups, according to the (absolutely extraordinary, by the way) site The Particle Adventure, of Berkeley Laboratories: the mesons, which we will not address here, and the "particles of force", by which the great forces of nature propagate and to which the Higgs boson would be somehow related.
These bosons, it must be emphasized here, are not all creatures as exotic as one might think.
In fact, if you manage to read this chronicle, it is thanks to a boson of an extraordinary banality: the photon, or the "particle of light" that is the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
When, in fact, a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it "disturbs" the electromagnetic field in this precise place, a bit like a pebble thrown into a pond.
From this "disturbation" arises an electromagnetic wave (light, or infrared, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon - and therefore, one of the "force-carrying" bosons.
More stable field
The same is true for the Higgs boson, except that it is another field, the Higgs field, that must be "disturbed" for this boson to appear.
Now, this Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, one must reach very, very high energies, a bit like a frozen pond whose surface could only be wrinkled by a very large rock.
That's why it takes a huge particle accelerator like CERN's - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring 27 km in circumference! - to reach such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and mass.
Not all particles, nor all materials, interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never hold itself on a fridge.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have a mass, while the others (like the photon, tiens) do not.
Now, what "can bring" all this research, Ms. Plamondon asks?
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the Standard Model (SM), and it also allows physicists to scrutinize any gap between the observations and predictions of the SM.
In fact, there are many who strongly wish that we find them, because the slightest difference could open a door on a "new physics" and plug some holes in the Model.
This one, it must be said, still has huge shortcomings, offering no explanation for gravity (oops!) or dark matter, which forms about 80% of the matter of the Universe (re-oops!).
But no such gaps have been found at CERN so far.
Implications
The repercussions of this research in the daily life of Mr. and Mrs. Tout-le-Monde, they are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will be none.
In the early 1960s, the pioneers of lasers at Bell Laboratories had no idea of the revolution their work would spark.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle - who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed), in 1962 - initially the laser was rather seen as a "lab gadget".
I can imagine...
And then, the applications can also come from all the instrumentation that surrounds the research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969, during his work in optics.
This sensor, although not its original intent at all, now serves as the “eye” for all digital cameras in the world, and earned it the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
This of course does not mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily transform our lives, but it does mean that, really, you never know...
Palliative Care - The Best Way to Die... _ The Duty _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
With its Dying with Dignity Commission, Quebec recently debated the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate is expected to resume shortly as a bill is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this crucial area.
Le Devoir tried to take a closer look.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that was gnawing at him had given him a two-year reprieve.
“They had given me five years to live, I turned seven,” he said, half-figure half-grape, lying in his bed at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home in Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
“But it’s always a shock, you can’t be prepared for that,” he says.
The disease does its work: a huge weakness that prevents him from going to the toilet alone, and even eating alone.
Seated in front of an appetizing lunch, he agrees to let himself be helped to eat, resigned.
Courageous, he even manages to smile, speaks to strangers who are busy around him, bring him his medicines, offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
“My biggest wish is to be cured of diarrhea, it’s humiliating,” he confides.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this ailment.
"In the course of our lives, we learn that a man pees standing up," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois house.
Going back to the child’s stage, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
"It depends on the person's ability" to accept regression, he notes.
Because, in the opinion of several people working in palliative care, great moments are taking place at the very heart of this regression.
Patients who enter the Victor-Gadbois hospice all have cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this point, the "team of doctors and nurses around them no longer provide so-called "curative" care.
For Ms. A., 89, the worst fear is to die "conscious and suffocated".
But the disease made me discover my children.
“I have good children,” she adds.
“I have no wishes in life,” she says, before agreeing to have a mask put on to help her breathe.
In the coming days, however, she is expecting a last visit from her son from Italy.
In Victor-Gadbois, along with a group of volunteers, body care and food assistance are provided.
These are palliative care, which is given when there is nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is one palliative care bed for 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very little when you know that we all end up dying one day.
Here, life goes on in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors in the house.
Whether on the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
When dying, it will be agreed to provide mouth care to brandy or Pepsi, depending on the request.
Diabetics will no longer be required to control their sugar levels.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night, we served a beer to Mr. X, who passed away last night.
This morning, it is his son who will finish the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help loved ones as much as patients," says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
At the Victor-Gadbois house, the days follow each other but they are not alike.
Alongside a 93-year-old man savouring his last family gathering in the courtyard, tucked in his pillows while drinking in his honor, a 36-year-old man tragically dies, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two young children, after trying everything to survive.
“For the past six months, there have always been three to five beds occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45,” Dr. Christiane Martel said.
53% of patients who are admitted to the Victor-Gadbois home arrive from their home, 47% come from the hospital.
Access to Palliative Care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient has reached the terminal stage of life, whether at home, in a hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as Maison Victor-Gadbois and the Société de société de société palliative <0xC3><0xA0> domicile du Grand Montréal, specialize more or less exclusively in the care offered to cancer patients.
It is precisely this great deficiency in Quebec health care that makes many doctors specializing in palliative care fear the adoption of a law governing euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto, signed by palliative care leaders including Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has been circulating to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec's health system is not performing well enough to ensure that everyone will be entitled to quality palliative care before euthanasia is accepted.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient spend 14 days in the emergency room, in great pain, without the necessary to relieve her.
I'm afraid patients only ask to die because they don't get the proper care.
And at the same time, several oncologists are working hard on their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognosis.
Helene Richard’s survival expectations were already minimal when she gave up trying chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was stopping treatment, she said she regretted that I stopped fighting, she said.
She told me I was finished!
Not almighty care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who ask to die thank caregivers for not having granted their request after they were relieved of their pain by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Greater Montreal Home Palliative Care Society, patients are said to be refractory to pain treatments in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, which is to put the patient to sleep until the moment of death, either sporadically or permanently.
We can no longer pretend not to hear that part of suffering.
Increasingly, the unrelieved patient will have the opportunity to have this palliative sedation.
The sick who are not relieved always say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that doesn’t necessarily mean “I want you to euthanize me,” it means “I want to be relieved.”
This report was made possible by a journalism fellowship from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Road officials, construction contractors, fundraisers of political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia tell day after day what they know of a formidable "system", mixing construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mafia.
An "industry" that cost Quebec taxpayers dearly, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's curious how the system crumbles since we took the great means," says Jacques Duchesneau, deputy in Quebec and former police chief of Montreal.
It was through him that the scandal broke out in 2011, through a substantive investigation into the malpractices related to road works contracts in Quebec, to which the Liberal Prime Minister of the time, Jean Charest, had consented only in retrospect.
The "Duchesneau report" established a direct link between industry, hidden party funding and corruption of civil servants.
“Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, the Ministry of Transport alone has saved a billion dollars on contracts,” he said.
The Charbonneau Commission "has already taken down two mayors", he adds, hoping that it will manage to "demonstrate the stratagems behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, created in 2011, also works with its army of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
Plus the police of the "Marteau squad" who, since 2009, would have led the "cartel of sewers" of Montreal to put the soft pedal on the swellings of contracts...
In recent weeks, it has carried out a series of searches and brought charges of fraud and corruption against municipal elected officials, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburban town.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned as mayor of Laval, Quebec’s third-largest city.
He is suspected of having repeatedly pocketed bribes in exchange for public contracts.
Also formally accused are engineers on the streets of Montreal and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter caused a sensation by explaining to the commission the mechanics of the "system" of obtaining public contracts.
For years, he himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary linked to the mafia who returned the money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito sowed seeds in the 2000s, giving more than CAD$88,000 (about $68,000) to provincial parties, especially the then-Liberals.
He also confessed to organizing an illegal fundraiser for former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewerage contracts whose costs he inflated
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked well.
Gilles Surprenant, a former public works engineer, detailed it well before the commission: in ten years, he received from construction companies gifts, invitations to trips, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and bribes totaling 736,000 dollars, in exchange for sewer contracts whose costs he inflated.
Other road officials have confessed to having greased the leg by inflating bills from 30% to 40%, by false extras.
Then an organizer for the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Tremblay of deliberately turning a blind eye to a parallel budget feeding his coffers with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first women elected in Montreal to sound the alarm.
Mayor of the borough of Rivi<0xC3><0xA8>re-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, she rebelled in 2010 against the sale of a municipal land bought 5 million dollars and sold... 1.6 million to developers, in the midst of a real estate boom.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
Of the investigation that will finally be set up, she says that she "pulls on a thread to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop gangrene and pin the culprits".
The process, she says, is “painful but positive.”
We are in the process of cleaning up the wound, but it would take an investigation unit specific to Montreal and a watch, not to see questionable practices return.
Just like we do the cleaning.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but is especially concerned about the role of "elected officials aware of the ploy", when they did not fall into the trap!
Estimating at 70% the share of dirty money in the financing of electoral campaigns in Quebec, he jokes: "I was told that it was only a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to parties to 100 dollars but this will not change the situation, according to him: "As long as we do not strictly limit election expenses, there will be dirty money in politics."
He advocates a complete overhaul of the system of awarding public contracts and financing parties: "We can not go lower; getting to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow to rebuild the house on a firmer basis, with more controls and laws."
If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh at it to look into their own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season, you have taken on a new dimension with PSG.
How do you explain this progression?
This can be explained by an individual awareness but also by the new dimension of PSG.
Great players have arrived.
Every day, I am progressing alongside them.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
On a daily basis, these elements push me to raise my level of play.
And in a game, it's easier.
Everything goes very fast in football.
But I'm not burning up.
From my beginnings at the INF Clairefontaine preformation centre to my time in Saint-Etienne, I have always progressed in stages.
So you take advantage of the competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer’s rookies are used to playing very high-level matches.
They also know that every workout is crucial.
This makes a player like me want to face and provide the maximum.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti brings me a lot in terms of my positioning.
He is supported by assistants like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man for the job?
Yeah, sure, sure.
Ancelotti inspires respect in all technicians.
Today, he has no equal in Ligue 1 and is one of the best European coaches.
He has a lot of experience and has won a lot of titles with upmarket clubs.
He played alongside some great players.
I think he will win more titles in Paris.
In January, I had a heartwarming discussion with him.
I came out of a series of injuries.
The trust he places in me also explains my performance.
What are your thoughts on the first part of the PSG season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took the lead.
But we remain in ambush.
One of our major goals is the Champions League: we qualified for the 8th final with style.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
We'll try to go as far as we can.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we will have our say against very good European teams.
We first want to finish first in our pool, ahead of Porto, to be able to receive in the 8th of the return final.
Can PSG become a big European club in the short term?
He already has the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris needs to win titles and register in the long term.
Today, that is not the case.
Financially, PSG is giving itself the means to make this project a reality.
In Ligue 1, not winning the title, like last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
This year, we really want to win the title of champion.
Last season, we didn't get far.
In May, there was disappointment because we had the qualities to finish first.
We had a very big season.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, we're supposed to be champions...
But another team, Montpellier, had an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it’s the right one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have the weapons to win.
Do you think the media expect too much from PSG?
It is normal that we are expected a lot of us in view of what has been invested and the players we have.
We totally accept it.
After that, when we win 4-0 at home against Troyes and we still find things to blame us for, it's sure to be a little frustrating.
I wonder what else people expect.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona.
We're trying to set up a game plan.
A team is built over time.
We proved in the Champions League that we could respond present.
Look at Manchester City, who haven’t qualified for the 8th final in two seasons, they’ve also made huge expenses!
With regard to the sums invested, we imagined you with 15 points ahead of the truce!
It was neglecting our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and tell ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we have finally won.
PSG seem totally dependent on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
So much the better to say that there is a "Zlatan dependence".
This means that Ibrahimovic is very successful and has a lot of goals.
He came for this and he proves that he is the star of Ligue 1.
He showed everywhere he went that he was a great player, a world star.
Within the group, we respect the man and the player.
He also respects the men he has around him.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
This pushes others to raise their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone to progress.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with the French team?
Like a disappointment.
I wanted to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from scrambling for game time.
I saw things there and came out stronger.
Today, I manage to make good matches in the national team.
That's what I've been hoping for since my baptism with the Blues.
Lessons have been learned from what has happened in Ukraine, and it is incumbent upon us to conduct ourselves in an exemplary manner.
What look do you take on the first months of Didier Deschamps at the head of Les Bleus?
He has the results for him.
We are well placed in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The coach is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires the winner.
As was Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
White had achieved his goal by qualifying for the Euro.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the Blues to Brazil.
Is the good draw (1-1) snatched on 16 October in Spain a founding match?
This match gave us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before this clash in Spain, I had never experienced a match like this in my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
Quite the opposite of current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between stakeholders.
Moreover, as often in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the belief that the current monetary system, made up of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros ...) and a secure exchange protocol in the manner of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files peer to peer.
Approximately 200,000 transactions have already been recorded through 15,000 computers on the network.
A few thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a means of payment.
The price of bitcoin, after reaching a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to 2 dollars, five months later, before returning today around ten dollars (the prices are listed on the site bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing very impressive, compared to world trade in real currency or financial products.
Yet, the European Central Bank (ECB) took an interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
She describes bitcoin as “the most successful virtual currency”, “in competition with the dollar or the euro” and “similar to conventional currencies”.
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currency such as “credits”, used to progress in a video game that you win by playing or can buy (and sometimes exchange in return).
The social network Facebook has also developed this kind of system.
But, each time, a central authority controls and processes the exchanges.
With Bitcoin, all nodes in the network are both bookkeepers, auditors, money issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Every transaction between two users is actually made between two email addresses in the manner of an e-mail.
Except that a user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is electronically signed by a dual-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the exchanged bitcoins exist in the public ledger, distributed throughout the network.
The key step is to write this new transaction in this book.
It involves solving a mathematical challenge to computers, the winner of which, as a kind of provisional central banker, will have the privilege of adding this additional line.
This is a file hashing phase, i.e. the transformation of a large file into a shorter and unique digital footprint.
Computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before they "hack" the whole thing.
The goal is to find the number that gives a particular footprint (many zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes easily verify that it is the right one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of all other transactions; any change would change the footprint.
If, to defraud, a user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (less than ten minutes), only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other remaining orphan because the two have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this reward is divided by two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible up to one hundred millionth, which leaves room...
The difficulty of the challenge is also met with each increase in computing power.
Network life has already had its ups and downs.
Websites providing services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins in stolen deposits.
“The flaw used is not about the protocol itself,” says Pierre Noizat, who just launched Paymium, a real-money payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also mentions the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this flaw.
Big players like Wikipedia refuse donations of this nature.
Others, like the WordPress blogging platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the ledger and showed that nearly 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, "giant sales" were launched.
“Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged,” says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, also author of an educational book on this currency, believes a lot in the potential of this technology as a network of transactions.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a contactless mobile payment, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which thus return cheaper.
The wearer also manages their identity and can therefore be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement for merchants, who do not need to install new terminals or software.
All they have to do is communicate an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize," says Pierre Noizat, who claims to have thousands of users.
There is a general movement to challenge hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
“It will take time for Bitcoin to prevail, but 2013 could be a turning point,” he predicts.
The ECB, in its report, also plans to reassess the various risks, now considered high, in case of success of this currency.
We left from Afghanistan.
And then what?
The French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the US are expected to follow by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take back its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without expecting anything from us.
It is above all the Afghan peasants that we have punished by considering them as terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, and the wounded, the maimed.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former chiefs of refugees in Pakistan, but often peasants who refuse the foreign armed presence, as in the days of the Soviets.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if they have been joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes aided by local insurgents, these will no longer be so when Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the Nijrab base, which I observed from the hills planted with almond trees thanks to French credits, was in order.
The convoys of trucks and armored vehicles reached Kabul without being attacked, overflew by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban onslaught on Kabul by the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was then empty, the country in fire and blood as a result of the struggles between different factions.
Their takeover of the country was then perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of these farmers who were overtaken by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved nowadays.
Former mujahideen, the Afghan government and the current Taliban are joining in the desire to keep women in an inferior position.
The main notables of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have turned into businessmen, seizing government land to resell as building land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from huge U.S. subcontracting contracts.
Most of them did not fight on their own; most of them did not fight on their own.
People, as I have heard in the countryside, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have profited from American largesse: the flight of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They have been around the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan, they have appreciated the advantages.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years of age; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the total population.
In the cities, government schools are full of girls as well as boys.
It will be necessary to provide work for these young people who will no longer want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties or the corruption of certain leaders.
All, including the armed opponents, are fond of mobile phones; television, and its Turkish soap operas that present a modern world, is followed everywhere.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who will order it be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already preoccupied with reconstituting provincial militias, which will escape central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain decentralization, like Western nations, but the United States wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with strong presidential power, removing the post of Prime Minister that existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and well before that.
No industry has been restarted, no dams are in place, no major irrigation systems are being repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruit and vegetables.
Priority is given to private initiative.
In a country ruined by thirty years of war, government control over infrastructure would have been necessary.
It has been rumored that Afghanistan has immense mineral wealth.
This only added to the feeling that Westerners were only there to seize it.
Without energy to process the iron ore or copper on site, or means of transport to export it through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have already almost left the Mes Aynak copper mine, leaving international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) to search the huge Buddhist site and remain the province’s largest employers.
Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports largely depend, will one day have to restore normal relations.
The departure of the French combat troops ended on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aids: high school for girls, boys, department of French at the university, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support to the Archaeological Delegation.
Since 2009, in an attempt to "win hearts and minds" and to carry out the impossible task of coinciding aid and offensive actions, a service of "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), suppressed in 2012, has carried out, and carried out by a small French NGO, many works of collective interest and agricultural rehabilitation actions in dozens of mountain villages.
These works, greedy in local labor, could help to contain the insurgency: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase of arable land.
What will we leave as a memory, after two billion euros of military spending?
A much smaller budget would help to improve the harsh local living conditions in these valleys, which are often more than 2,000 metres above sea level.
The embassy received dozens of written requests for small agricultural achievements from local communities in Kapisa province.
In order for them to free themselves from the insurgency carried out by foreign groups, which I have been told by the farmers to wish for, it would be necessary to maintain in their favour a small, well-controlled civilian aid which affects them directly.
A Forceps Constitution in Egypt
This is a new poker move from President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration, which provisionally grants it full powers, it has decided to play its game.
Taking everyone for granted, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the next day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State gave this House two more months to complete its work.
For almost two years now, Egypt has been relying on a provisional text, which has been amended several times, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal entanglements.
This new initiative has only increased the fracture in the country.
For his opponents, the President perseveres in his "autocratic delusion", continuing to "betray his word" and "tramp the law".
On the side of its supporters, it is assured that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as soon as possible, by accelerating the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 15 days.
A very short period of time that forces the Brothers to give up their project to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way to regain popular and democratic legitimacy while the protest rages throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that Egyptians will vote for him, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Especially since this recourse to a hasty vote is due to the ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "Either you vote for my text, or I keep the full powers", these supposedly end after the adoption of the Constitution.
It was in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, overwhelmingly Islamist, voted on the text yesterday.
Most of the Liberals missed the call.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had slammed the door, feeling that they had not been able to assert their views.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society had done the same.
In order for the necessary quorum to be reached, 11 people, replacement members, were added in haste yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Unsurprisingly, it is most often unanimously that the articles were voted on.
Commentators have also been amused by the fact that one of the only discrepancies of the day was expressed around... the hour of prayer, some members of the committee believing that the clock of the constituent was badly set.
The text, which was still being voted on last night, contains 234 articles.
Finally, Article 2 remains identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, stipulating that "the principles of sharia are the main source of law."
Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a major demand, hoped to be able to replace “the principles” with “the rules”, which would have allowed for stricter enforcement.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a pledge of their good will and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
“Hypocrisy,” the Liberals reply, seeing it as nothing more than a communication stunt.
For according to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
These include article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular with regard to verifying the conformity of laws with Sharia law.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, this is worrying because "the people called to vote are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
We can see the beginnings of a theocracy.”
The Liberals' fears are further fuelled by the fact that the next rector of this university should be much less moderate than the current one.
"At the moment, there is no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state.
Most of the jurists who have worked on this text are not ulemas but academics, for some trained in the French system," tempers Alexis Blouet, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges "there may be ambiguity around Article 220, because the terms used borrow from religious vocabulary.
It refers to "fiqh" in particular [Islamic jurisprudence, ed.].
And the question may arise in the future as to the extent to which civilian judges are competent to rule on it.”
Beyond its religious aspect, the text voted yesterday is highly criticized because of the extensive powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argues that these are significantly reduced compared to what they were under the old regime.
Another contentious point: the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the review of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a National Defence Council.
Nor will trials of civilians in military courts, as requested by human rights groups, be prohibited.
The latter also express their concerns about the text, which they consider to be liberticidal.
The crime of blasphemy is maintained and insult is now prohibited, which could have serious consequences on freedom of expression, especially of the press.
In addition, no article echoes the protection of women, said Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point was the prohibition of torture under article 36.
The word did not appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president was scheduled to speak last night on television, protests are planned this afternoon.
The president’s supporters will march on Saturday.
In Israel, holy places, the Center of the World and a sea of brine await Ukrainian tourists
The Promised Land brings together the grandeur of biblical truths, modern comforts, and wild nature.
Argumenty i Fakty has selected five great reasons to visit Israel.
Go and adore the holy places
An unmissable visit: the banks of the Jordan, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that anyone who enters these "baptismal funds" will be touched by Divine Grace.
As for Galilee, it is the land of the miracles of Jesus: where the water was changed into wine, where Jesus walked on the water, where he calmed the storm or where the fishing was miraculous.
It is in this precise place that Jesus appeared before his disciples after the Resurrection.
But where you will find the most holy places is in Jerusalem.
Believers walk the Rue de la Souffrance or the Way of the Cross (Latin: Via Dolorosa).
This path begins near the fortress Antonia (the Praetorium), where the trial was held, then leads through the streets of the old town to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on Golgotha, to the place of the Crucifixion, then to that of the Stone of Anointing and the tomb.
Here is the Christian center of the world, symbol of the salvation of humanity.
According to Christian legend, the monastery of the Cross is erected on the spot where grew the tree used to make the cross on which Jesus was crucified.
Jerusalem is also home to the most sacred place of the Jews: the Western Wall which constitutes the rest of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 BC.
According to tradition, people of different faiths leave small words accompanied by prayers that are then answered.
Travel in height
Visit the ruins of the Masada fortress, an ancient refuge against enemies built by Herod the Great in 25 BC for his family.
These ruins are located on the steep rocks of a mountain 450 m above sea level.
Only mountaineers can get there on their own.
For the others, a cable car takes them to this summit full of history.
In the north of the country, between 1,600 and 2,040 m above sea level, is the Mont Hermont ski resort, which welcomes many tourists in winter.
A shuttle can take you there from the foot of the mountain.
The ski slopes are a total of 45 km long.
The old belief is that pagan gods once inhabited the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
The country is home to nearly 300 museums.
It is impossible to visit them all in one stay.
Here are the five most interesting that are really worth the detour.
First: the Israel Museum located near the Knesset (parliament).
It houses the very ancient Qumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea Scrolls, discovered in the Judean Desert caves, as well as nearly 500 miles of archaeological and anthropological objects.
See also: Tel Aviv Museum of Art.
The paintings of the Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso are mainly exhibited here.
In Acre, the Hammam Al-Basha awaits you with its Turkish baths composed of casts of visitors and supervisors of the time.
Once in Caesarea, enter the unique private Ralli Museum where you can admire Rodin’s sculptures.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free and donations are prohibited.
The fifth museum is the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem Memorial, located in Tel Aviv, which revisits the most dramatic historical pages in history.
The most tragic part is the children’s memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children exterminated in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter and enter in total darkness.
Stars are twinkling.
Then you hear the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health and well-being
The three major seaside resorts of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each of them offers swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and giant aquariums.
Note: you can swim in the Red Sea even in winter, because the water temperature does not drop below 21°C while the air can reach 23°C.
The Dead Sea is even hotter and you can swim in it all year round.
By the way, this is the most unique sea in the world: it occupies the lowest point on Earth, 417 m below sea level.
The azure-colored water contains brine and very easily retains bathers, even those who do not know how to swim.
The landscapes that surround it are of surreal beauty.
We come there to carry out a treatment based on salt water, silt, healing mud and to cure various diseases such as dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes but also to simply relax.
Discover the secrets of Antiquity
They are guarded by Tel Aviv’s Old City, Jaffa, on the edge of the Mediterranean Sea.
It is crossed by the famous Via Maris that connects Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in Greek and Egyptian legends of antiquity.
According to legend, it is here that Noah built his ark and that Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom he lived a long and happy life here.
Tourists especially like to stroll through the narrow alleys that are named after the signs of the zodiac.
It is said that if you touch the walls of the street corresponding to "your" sign, fate will smile at you.
In Jaffa you can meet newlyweds who have come to take pictures from all over Israel and even from other countries.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can stroll through the Roman theater, "conquer" the Crusader fortress.
Under the Roman Empire, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Note to tourists
If you go to Israel, don’t worry about your English: about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
For your trip, it is better to prefer dollars to euros, as they are easily exchangeable in shekels (today 1 dollar is equivalent to 3.8 shekels).
In terms of urban transport, these are mainly buses, but Jerusalem is equipped with a fast tram and Haifa has the only metro line in the country, consisting of six stations and able to connect the lower and upper parts of the city.
It is almost an underground funicular.
The journey in all types of public transport costs 6 shekels and allows you to make changes for 1h30.
In Israel, the Jewish tradition is to celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday.
From Friday evening until sunset on Saturday, markets, shops and public transport cease to operate.
And the work week begins on Sunday morning.
Many cafes, restaurants, and hotels serve only kosher food, which excludes pork, seafood, scaleless fish, and dishes consisting of both milk and meat.
It offers a multitude of lamb and beef dishes, soups and desserts based on coconut milk but also hummus, traditional Jewish dough, different sauces, ground chickpea balls, falafels, fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
On the other hand, there are many well-fed cats that walk the haughty air.
They can be seen sleeping on the roofs of parked cars at night.
These felines love passing places and do not refuse to be enjoyed.
Renting a car varies depending on the brand from $37 for 24h (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance costs $15 a day.
Renting a bike will cost you 15 shekels a day.
Admission to the museum costs an average of 30 shekels.
The Language of Numbers
Three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel in 2012.
These were mostly people who came to travel and rest from the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
118.8 miles of Ukrainian tourists visited the Promised Land from January to October 2012, 51% more than in 2010, before the cancellation of visas on February 9, 2011.
"Who has language, in Moscow goes": migrants save money to learn the language
As MPs and human rights activists debate what the law on compulsory language testing will bring, fraudsters selling "fake" certificates have already made an appearance in the country
Every year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal: to earn money to help their families stay at home.
Since December 1st, a law has come into force stipulating that every migrant worker will have to pass a Russian exam.
For the time being, this rule applies only to those intending to work in the services, housing, personal services and retail sectors.
However, over time, promises the Federal Migration Service, tests will become mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, it will be necessary to validate the knowledge of the language, but also that of the History of Russia and the foundations of law.
It will be necessary to validate your language skills in Russian to obtain and renew your work permit.
Only nationals of countries where Russian has official language status are exempt.
Persons who obtained educational certificates or diplomas before the fall of the USSR in 1991 are also not covered by this law.
Benefit, negative attitude and protection of rights
The network of examination centers will be under the aegis of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, the University of Friendship of Peoples, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants will be able to take the exams in all the cities of the country: more than 160 centers have already been opened throughout the territory.
This initiative to introduce examinations was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service.
But, before the law comes into force, human rights defenders have already repeatedly asked the question in the press: what will it give?
What will the obligation to know Russian change for Russians and immigrants?
First of all, respond representatives of the migration service, it will reduce the number of people suffering "slavery at work".
Many are talking about defending the rights of migrant workers, says Victor Sebelev, director of the Russian Federal Migration Service’s office in Tajikistan.
The protection of rights must begin before their departure.
Only an organized system of selection will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise for migrants without a profession, without training, who do not know the language and who do not have medical certificates.
Without understanding the language, Sebelev certifies, the future migrant is destined to meet dishonest people who, under the pretext of helping him, will provide him with a "trip" to an overcrowded house where he and dozens of his fellows will torment themselves for months without food and without papers and will have to work between 12 and 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
"They are promised one thing, and when they arrive, they are deceived, they take their passports, and they do not receive the expected salary," confirms the Head of the Directorate of Migration Services for Labour of the Migration Service of Tajikistan, Tolib Sharipov.
Don't argue with me, officer!
However, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who want to come to Russia to earn money are confident that they not only do not know the language of the country where they want to go, but also that they write with difficulty in their own language.
It is not their fault, of course, but their misfortune: few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford even a fair primary education.
Indeed, their families do not even have enough to feed their children without talking about dressing them properly and equipping them for school.
As soon as they reach adolescence, these young people leave to earn money as soon as the opportunity presents itself.
It’s hard when you don’t know the language, they confide.
"You feel diminished and diminished."
However, human rights defenders note an important aspect of the language law.
The exams will be intended only for migrants who have legal status.
Without status, there will be no formal examination or work afterwards.
Yet most migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or welcome to enter"
Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason? Administrative barriers and always these language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: between 12 and 16 rubles.
And then one can get a fake registration quickly for only 1,500 rubles.
The Russian police know that we have false documents, that we do not have a record, hence the cases of extortion.
“They are asking us for 100, 200 rubles, enough to buy cigarettes, tea,” Umed Khoushkadamov, a Tajikistani national, told reporters.
“Make it quick, don’t skimp, and buy yourself a beautiful work of art.”
From the first day of the entry into force of the Language Act, it was discovered that the registration papers of migrants were not the only ones to be false.
Several fake language test certificates have already been confiscated by employees of the Federal Migration Service.
Falsified papers come out of an ordinary color printer.
Of course, their new owners did not take them for nothing: every migrant who hoped to make the examinations easier had to pay seven thousand rubles for this document.
It is two and a half times more expensive than the official procedure: it will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles.
Officials and human rights advocates agree that the short-term goal is to protect the system from corruption so that it is impossible to simply buy these "paper bits".
The authorities can give migrant workers who have not been able to pass the examination on the first try time to take language courses.
In addition, immigrants who do not know Russian will be offered work in areas that do not involve actively communicating with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not deal with the arms market
The share of crimes involving legal weapons is very low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior proposes to toughen the law against civilian weapon bearers.
This is the reaction of the authorities in the face of recent incidents: whether it is the shootings carried out at weddings or the massacre organized by the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, which left seven dead.
Police want to ban the use of rubber bullets in public places and raise the legal age for a gun licence from 18 to 21.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma committee for security and anti-corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that amendments to the arms law would be introduced in the State Duma soon.
Not everyone is happy to see that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by "tightening the screw".
An open letter appeared on the Net in which its authors, representatives of various shooting centers, demand to abandon "this senseless hardening".
The percentage of crimes committed with a registered weapon is minimal, Vasiliy Lesnikov, a lawyer and crime specialist for the BBC, told the Russian service.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, over a six-month period in 2012, 142 crimes were committed with a firearm registered in the police services while 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded over the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that strengthening civilian gun laws will not prevent criminals from sourcing from the black market.
According to them, any weapon can be found in Moscow today for a reasonable price.
However, the Ministry of the Interior says it controls the spread of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factory to officer
The black market in arms is provided through several channels.
There are five main canals, says Victor Baranets, a retired colonel who served in the Ministry of Education and Headquarters for 10 years.
Screenshot from a site taking gun orders
The first is "military trace", that is, weapons that were stolen during military operations in the Caucasus.
“These weapons were stolen by Russian officers, but also by Caucasians,” Baranets said.
The second type of black market weapons are those stolen by criminals from law enforcement.
Baranets explains that these are both weapons stolen from police stocks and those stolen directly from law enforcement officials.
Illegal pistols go on sale from military warehouses.
Many of them have often suffered explosions.
“Attested versions indicate that some fires were deliberately set to hide the deficit,” the former military official said.
For Baranets, the arms manufacturers have something to do with it.
“We see private arms factories that do not compete with the competition in the international market and sell weapons on the black market, especially in Moscow,” says an expert.
One of the other sources of the black market is smuggling.
A significant proportion of pistols and submachine guns come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
“There is a local production, sometimes artisanal, a mafia has formed and organizes the supply,” adds the former military.
Where did the weapons come from?
Experts assessed the approximate share of each source of illegal weapons on the black market.
A report on the issue was established in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Study of Public Administration.
Specialists analysed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminal records and public data from weapons portals.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers explain, come from the military and law enforcement.
Half of the weapons on the black market ended up there "due to the fault of employees whose work is related to weapons," the report said.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from places of military conflict, 14% are stolen at the time of manufacture and 5% are from “clandestine excavations”.
An armoury salesman and consultant who asked to remain anonymous says that for a long time no one has bought the weapons found by these clandestine search specialists; they are too old.
Most often, according to him, sellers will look for the new goods in military warehouses.
The person buys through a sign a unit, for example a TT gun.
It is delivered to him by passing the goods through a wire mesh.
“He transports it to the city and resells it for €900 per unit with two chargers,” he says.
“It is true that the police are aware of all the cases, so when crimes are about to be solved, they make a control purchase from the illegal arms dealers,” the seller adds.
"Like in a luxury boutique"
The seller and the buyer are usually found through knowledge.
I consulted websites, blogs, until a guy showed up and offered to come to Begovaya station where someone would take me to a "corner" to haggle.
The price of the gun, they gave it to me on the spot
Victor Baranets as military observer
To find a gun, I need to know someone who has a contact, explains the seller. I know someone, but I do not trust him.
There are sellers in the markets, but there must also come saying for example "On behalf of such a person, who asked me to convey that his daughter has lost a tooth".
Now I even buy a pair of American fists with the help of someone I trust.
He only gives them to me because he knows I won't give them to him.
Young children look for weapons in different ways.
Former military officer Victor Baranets tried his hand as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
The patterns, he said, have not changed.
He was given a photo album in which there was "everything we want".
“I thought I was in a luxury shop,” the soldier recalls.
There is no secret for the buyer, explains Baranets, we can try everything.
As a potential customer, I don't just buy, we go with the seller in the forest and set a target.
"They let me shoot and when I am convinced that the weapon is working well, we start negotiating," the expert describes.
A shop from his sofa
Search engines display sites and groups on Vkontakte where one can buy weapons "for different uses".
For this, we do not need any documents and no one to meet.
"It is enough to have a precise amount of money," it says in an advertisement on the site "Buy a pistol or a fighting machine gun."
Users leave their request and ask their questions.
And we sell to miners?
"Unlicensed, of course," asks user "Ivan" (spelling retained).
"Buy TT. Moscow", writes "Fedorenkov" in his very direct request.
The Federal Security Service has spread a huge network of fake sites and scoops up people who want to buy combat weapons.
People flock to food like hungry wolves and then they find themselves mining coal in Siberia.
Victor Baranets, observer and former military officer
I have heard about this type of schemes: generally, the site is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer makes the payment on the automatic terminals.
“In return, he receives a photo and instructions indicating where the weapon is hidden,” said Dmitry Kislov, secretary of the Right to a Gun Association.
Victor Baranets says that by making a request on the site, we can find ourselves without a weapon and behind bars.

A Makarov for 100 dollars
Buying an illegal firearm, experts estimate, can cost between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the association "Right to a weapon", one can buy a Makarov pistol for 100-300 dollars.
We will have to wait about a month and a half.
It came out of the long-term warehouses by the management of these medium-sized warehouses.
According to official data of the ministry, compared to the period January-October 2011, the number of such crimes overall decreased by 7% in Russia and amounted to 22.9 miles while the proven cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosive substances and bombs decreased by 7.8%.
U.S.: Fast-food and supermarket workers on strike
Nearly a quarter of U.S. teens go through a cashier job at McDonald's
In recent days, a wave of protests has mounted against the low wages practiced by Walmart supermarkets and the famous fast food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
At the moment, no one can predict whether this wave will gain momentum or run out of steam quickly.
These actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing associations.
At the same time as the modest wage increases for basic workers at Walmart and in fast-food chains, the organizers of the protests are seeking the creation of unions.
This sector is not currently covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week, after Thanksgiving, the "Black Friday," at a time when a torrential rain of sales seizing millions of inhabitants fell on America and sometimes triggering scandals.
On that day, some employees of Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left their jobs to organize strike pickets with unions and left-wing activists in the company’s stores whose products are aimed at consumers of the modest and middle classes.
Walmart markets everything from diapers to shotguns to car batteries, vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That’s why many low-paid employees at Walmart shop only at their workplaces.
The price and choice of products have made Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell its products cheaply due to the low salaries of its employees.
They also complain about difficult working conditions, for example the lack of forklifts or portable scanners.
The participants of the "Black Friday" protests demanded a salary increase, they complained about the fact that the price of medical insurance provided by the company had increased from 30 to 100 dollars per month.
For the basic employee at Walmart who earns $9.5 an hour, this is an amount he cannot afford.
Scientists at the University of California, Berkeley have shown that if Walmart increased the average wage to $12 an hour, it would cost the group $3.2 billion.
That’s 1.1 percent more than he currently spends.
If Walmart were to shift the entire wage increase onto the shoulders of consumers, every run in the store would go to 46 cents more.
They will spend in a year only $12.39 more than now.
Walmart supporters note with satisfaction that the protests took place in only nine states and did no harm to the group.
Black Friday continued in stores from 8 p.m. to midnight the next day and Walmart sold 5,000 items per second over that period.
Its cashiers have made a total of 100 million transactions for "Black Friday".
Company spokesman Dan Fogleman said in an interview with the left-leaning Huffington Post that "fewer than five" Walmart employees had left their jobs and that the protest was just a "com operation among many others" on the part of the organizing union.
"Next customer!"
The protests continued this week in New York and were not about Walmart stores (in this progressive city, they are not very popular, which is why they are not yet established there) but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald’s advertises selling billions of servings and then they don’t even give you sick leave and don’t pay you for the work you’ve done honestly!
Jumaane Williams, Member of the New York City Council
Currently, the federal and New York minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.
Fast foods increase them over time, but by little, on average, its core employees make in New York $8.90 an hour.
No one touches less than they do in this town.
It's inconceivable for me to live with that money in New York.
There was a time when nearly a quarter of American teenagers worked at McDonald's after high school while living with their parents.
Few people saw it as their main source of income or wanted to stay there for a long time.
Today, I find myself interviewing McDonald's employees who complain about having to live on that salary and sometimes having to feed their children with it.
On the other hand, on the forum of the Wall Street Journal there are comments saying that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know what you are going to feed them.
Protesters who launched the movement Thursday at 6:30 a.m. near McDonald's on 40th Street and on Madison Avenue demanded that cashiers and fast-food cooks be paid at least $15 an hour, more than twice the current minimum wage.
They also called for the creation of unions in the fast-food sector.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from obstructing it and punishing union protesters with bullying or layoffs.
However, the administration rarely simplifies their lives.
For a union, taking over fast food remains a difficult task, and that, for concrete reasons.
One of the main ones is the extraordinary staff turnover.
They do not agree
Other tumultuous protests were held near several other fast food chains.
The highlight of the protest was the midday rally near McDonald’s in Times Square with the intervention of several local Democratic politicians, including that of Jumaane Williams, a member of the City Council, who said: “McDonald’s announces selling billions of portions and after they don’t even give you sick leave and don’t pay you for the work you’ve done honestly!”
The demonstrators were backed by other prominent New York Democrats, including Mayor Bill De Blasio, who said, “We all need to support fast food workers so they get a fair wage and the economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves.
The New York Times characterized the event as the largest in the history of the fast food industry.
But only a few hundred people participated, not to mention that not all of them were fast-food workers, who employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is difficult to say at the moment whether this spark of mass movement will make small ones.
"At the moment, we can only averagely fool the brain"
Lately, fans of new technologies have become accustomed to perceiving augmented reality through special glasses.
Initially, it was Google that unveiled this summer its current model at its annual conference and in November we learned that Microsoft had applied for the patent.
However, it is clear from the interview with the director of the group of interactive 3D technologies of the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, that for the scientists of this company, the glasses are already ancient history.
They are tempted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, by creating open virtual spaces.
- Could you tell us in a few words what your research group is doing?
- We are working on the interaction between man and machine and at the same time we are trying to expand the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity as a whole has remained for the moment to the pixels on a flat screen and sometimes to the touch.
We want to look 5 to 10 years ahead of us and guess at the radical changes that will occur with this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is sold today without Kinect because everyone is interested in gesture control.
- What does the future hold?
- Although the Kinect rendered the physical interaction, a lot of things happen on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The information capture has been improved (the system receives more data), but the performance, for now, not really.
We’re trying to change that and we’re working on truly 3D imaging systems that run on different technologies, including projection technologies.
We have to take the computer world out into our own, into the physical world, make it more tactile.
For this, however, it is necessary to identify not only the user, but also the space that surrounds him.
Thus, we will be able to complete the real world with virtual objects in a more practical form.
And for starters, let’s get rid of those stupid virtual reality headsets!
- What do you think of voice control?
It’s appreciated, but isn’t it overrated?
It cannot be called a panacea: the question of confidentiality arises because one does not always want to inform others of one's actions or intentions.
In fact, every type of interaction with the computer is good, but each in its niche.
For example, to order the devices in public places, we had a project for which we thought of gestures, not broad gestures, but rather discreet, restricted gestures.
The gestures were not captured by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet worn by the hand that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is currently large, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a watch.
In fact, the future will be marked by the mixed command, for example: gesture + voice.
- What do you mean?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass you this can?
You would do it with words and gestures.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, it's gonna be hard to recognize.
- So, you want to force users to adapt based on what the machine may or may not do at any given time?
- Not necessarily, but it is a mutual rapprochement.
I think that very soon we will have to work on the development of new types of sensors that will allow us to better identify human reactions.
These can be for example laser sensors, they produce a fairly good resolution in depth and this is very important.
- If we are interested in your work on Xbox Kinect sensors, what is it that you do not like in modern cameras?
Do they lack resolution, depth, or something else?
- In principle, it is on the current generation that we base our work on 3D recognition.
It would obviously be good to get about 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 c/s.
But the problem is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
Compared to this last point, all current technologies are quite good, it adds work to the algorithm designers.
It is necessary to keep in mind the resolution along the axes X and Y, but also Z.
Speed also matters a lot, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and 30 c/s is really not enough, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our laboratory in Redmond, gave the sensor touch a regular processing delay of between 1 and 100 <0xCE><0xBC>s, with the current sensors being closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands how much this influences the interaction of man and machine.
I would need a device of this type in my work, but not requiring touch, to have more frames per second.
Shouldn’t the number of cameras be increased?
The Kinect now has three cameras, one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the second, a reflected signal receiver.
And the third camera is actually a regular visible field sensor.
It is not used to define the depth of the object.
Many cameras can solve this problem.
Or make it worse by increasing the required volume of calculations.
It would be interesting to create a flexible product similar to the Kinect, play with the curve of the cameras and see how it could help define the locations.
As far as I can remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present its glasses to the public.
Don’t you think that from a point of view of the daily use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the platforms with the most perspectives?
- Of course, walking around all the time with a smartphone with your hands up is not practical but here's what I think: the best option would be a "transient" augmented reality that would allow you from a cloud platform to switch from glasses to the smartphone.
Glasses are a very personal device and that's what makes them strong (the personal elements are those that you are the only one to see) and at the same time their weakness: augmented reality from glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is no longer accessible only to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to the mere mortal.
There is a problem on which opponents of this idea point the finger: there is no tactile sensation!
The hands feel nothing.
What responses is your group preparing for this challenge?
- In my classes, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth could very well be the addition of tactile sensations.
For the moment, one of the interesting techniques is the use of the second hand to serve as an image support.
It perfectly records the pressures!
But there are also technologies that are really intended to attribute palpability to these "images in the air": for example the interference of several ultrasound rays directed to a precise point where the finger is located and which gives you the sensation, for the moment still weak, of a breath of air on the tips of the fingers.
There are also bracelets worn on the wrists that affect the nerve endings of the fingers, they are also a working axis with perspectives.
- And you tried to trick the brain?
Make him believe that he feels what he should normally feel the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried it yet.
There’s one more task down there that will take a long time to work on: how to make someone who’s physically in a very small space think they’re walking in an almost infinite open space – we’re working on the concepts of treadmills (nothing to do with those found in fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also giant balls.
At the moment, we can only averagely fool the brain, there are still many years of work left.
This is what makes the work on virtual reality so interesting for the researcher: many things are still in the absolute state of fertilization.
The reign of taste and not culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "The Petersburg avant-garde" dedicated to city dwellers who are ahead, at the forefront of culture and art.
This ultra-selective list has already welcomed prominent actors of the St. Petersburg art scene whose achievements go beyond the city border and who have found recognition in Europe, after being known throughout Russia.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extroverted painter Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, this rather bearded man, all dressed in red that can be seen near the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden or even in trendy parties and vernissages.
Kirill Miller’s paintings always bring crowds together, no matter where they are exhibited.
He is one of the essentially social and philosophical St. Petersburg storytellers, one of the founders of the new myths.
Kirill Miller is a prominent representative of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance makes the inhabitants smile and puts them in a good mood.
He recently took in his hands an organ of Barbarism and he became the symbol of this instrument in St. Petersburg since he had matured enough for this difficult role by his existence, his philosophy and his image as a bohemian.
- Kirill, why do you walk through the city in red and not in yellow or turquoise blue for example?
- I chose red as a couturier specialized in appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the painter, the image maker and society.
Even if in society, everything that is not gray arouses aggression and negative agitation.
But my provocations are intended to start the discussion.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to discussion.
When did you realize you had to be a painter?
- At the exhibition of the Nevskiy Palace of Culture where my works were located.
I knew it was my way.
Then the wave of old unofficial painters had passed and the new, free, in my genre, were misunderstood.
I began to befriend the painters of the new wave, with those of the Postgazonevshchina who gave birth to "Puchinskaya-10" and then there was no more wave.
I am interested in theatre, fashion, music, all genres except words.
It was important for me to be at the center of St. Petersburg's culture where the best creative forces must come together.
In 1995, I took my seat at Pushkinskaya-10, which before the works housed a music and art club, a bohemian club, the home of the Petersburg bohemian.
Many were born there: The NAME, Tequila-jazz, I still see Chnour arrive with the project "Van Gogh's ear".
Chnour and his friends sang easy songs in tight-fitting jerseys, among them Igor Vdovin, now a fashionable composer.
When the band started performing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trakhtenberg had a lot of programming before the time of Hali Gali.
We gave them Trakhtenberg and it was then that his great career began, but his training and basic education, it was here that he received them.
Gallery "D137", Club "Griboyedov": these are repercussions of the Artistic Clinic.
Our employees went there as regulars.
I am a hero of the last century, of the time when culture meant something.
In 2000, a survey was organized in the press: it was the prize "The personalities of our city".
I was named Painter of the Year, and that’s when my reign ended.
It is not convenient to work in a new era with old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, one can be popular, but not really a person of culture.
- Your works are characterized by a recognizable style.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they have a topicality and a very strong acuity.
I'm going to have an exhibition scheduled "The Russian Museum through clowns".
Clowns belong to a timeless category.
I used to be a social person, today it hurts and it's scary to be that way.
But with the clowns, everything fades away, the tragic falls away.
I like the grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the idea of saving the world through total and compulsory disguise.
Today, it is the dress that matters, we are interested in the external mechanism, but not inside the person.
Maybe we can't shake his hand, but we have to spit in his face.
And the lie will be erased by the disguise.
Recently we saw you in the role of the organ player of Barbarism. - A cultural city must have this kind of hero.
Who else but me can play it.
- But maybe commercial art can also be beautiful?
- Today the commercial art must be neat, delicate, liqueur.
A disintegration of culture is taking place.
Before, people were divided into herds, the supporters of bohemian love one thing, deny another.
Today, everything is divided into micro-communities, it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar bill to please everyone.
Today, you have to think about who you're going to like.
Each star has 100 fans.
- But several thousand people come to see Stas Mikhailov!
- It's people we threw away who come to see him, it's the sexual and social side that works.
But for the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 miles will not come and in the end it's less management, money, everything dries up.
I have my fans, the main thing is not to deceive them, not to spoil the experience.
When I was young, I painted paintings that a collector hung next to Falk or Larionov.
I started with paintings that are usually those that are painted at the end of life.
Today, ideas are often confused.
It is said: there is the spiritual culture, the culture of consumption.
Consumption has no culture, it has nothing to do with it.
I am a representative of the culture of yesterday, I grew up with the example of painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and who refused money precisely for painting.
I am for this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is this concept: the functionary of culture.
But not everyone can work in culture.
In the reign of the good tsars, it was not like that, the tsars did not understand the culture well, but they understood that it was necessary to keep the good experts.
In Moscow today there are good consultants.
We have people here in St. Petersburg who might be experts, but they are sidelined, because it takes higher experts who will properly evaluate these experts and work their way through them.
Currently, it is the "kingdom of taste" that is flourishing.
The same Erarta, but they differ in that they honestly say that they do not take all contemporary art, that there are painters who must find other museums.
- What is St. Petersburg to you?
- St. Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is a soil for it.
And on our stones, art has a hard time pushing.
We need a cultural soil and we have more writers than readers, that's bad.
In Europe, there are many curious people who go to see exhibitions, concerts.
At home, this layer is very thin.
We must make art fashionable as it was at the beginning of the last century.
Project carried out with the support of the St. Petersburg Stock Exchange
Giving Birth in Space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a deadly asteroid.
Caravans of space shuttles with Earthlings on board go in search of a rescue planet.
To save humanity, a big question arises: how to continue to make our species live in weightlessness or on a rescue planet?
I don't think there's much of a choice.
There are actually two real planets that can be conquered, if only by hypothesis.
"This is Venus and Mars," says Vladimir Sourdine, a researcher at the P.K. Chternberg State Astronomical Institute (GAICh).
If conditions on Mars are more suitable for life, the temperature on the surface of Venus is 500 degrees Fahrenheit.
We can only live there at very high altitude or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
We began to focus on the issues of reproduction in space by focusing on the flora.
Half a century ago, experiments were conducted on plants.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit did not differ in any way from terrestrial varieties.
Then we put into orbit insects, small reproductive Drosophila flies.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to see how a weightless embryo developed.
At the exit, a completely normal chick is obtained.
Then the problems begin.
"The problem is that the chick has to find support, it has to get on its legs and start moving," says the director of the laboratory of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IMBP) Vladimir Sychev.
Finding no support, the chicks agitated in a disordered manner.
And after 10 hours, the newborns saw their instincts completely atrophied.
The chicks did not react to light or sound.
Unfortunately, they would simply die after four days.
“We widened their eyes twice, and then we gave up, because it is simply impossible to work with them there,” says Vladimir Sychev, noting the failure of the experiment with chicks in space.
The last biological "miniature ark" with animals was sent into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, the biosatellite "Bion" will only carry species of the same sex.
There was an experiment with rats sent with their fetuses into space.
In principle, nothing supernatural has been discovered.
"It was still about biosatellites and then it's the only experiment. You have to do this kind of research," notes Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats gave birth to their offspring.
However, reproductions directly in space are not yet possible.
It's no small matter.
By losing their usual environment, animals are no longer able to carry out their sexual instincts.
Unlike animals, humans are capable of this in principle.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, it is able to create a suitable emotional background.
This type of experiment is not conducted for ethical reasons.
Women have been in space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was taken by Tereshkova.
And the female organism is what humanity has most precious.
Our seagull flew away and no one on Earth could tell if it would hold up after a flight into space.
If only she could have given birth to a child after the robbery.
“No one was answering that question,” says Vakhtang Vatchnadze, a rocket and space retiree.
In June 1964, just one year after her flight into space, the first female cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a baby girl.
The child's father, Andrian Nikolayev was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second female cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, after being twice in orbit and even working in an extra-vehicular environment, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk persists.
We have few, even very few cosmonauts who have had nothing and who give birth to a healthy offspring after long flights.
"And if they are longer, this presents a danger even during flights in orbit," concludes the pilot and cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of Russia, Valeriy Poliakov.
Yet humanity must seek new solutions in biotechnologies, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
Hydrology laboratory of the Cosmonaut Preparation Center: mandatory step of preparation for flight.
Here, in zero buoyancy, cosmonauts train for extra-vehicular sorties.
Water imitates weightlessness.
If for adults, water is comfortable but yet a foreign environment, for infants, it is their true element.
Small amphibious men seem to confirm it: life on Earth comes from the ocean.
Since the baby evolves about 9 months in the lymphatic fluid of his mother's belly, it is easier for him to get used to water afterwards.
This is in principle logical, because from its birth until its first bath, it happens only 2 weeks.
“It’s very little to forget,” says infant swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
In a word, if for the child who has just been born weightlessness is a more natural state, the woman needs gravitation, a force of weight.
In weightlessness, the muscles of the belly, pelvis atrophy very quickly, the baby's ability to push is lost.
Okay, well, let's ignore that by relying on birth simulators.
We can of course prepare a birth in a special room, the woman will manage to get it out.
"And then?" asks Valeriy Poliakov to invite reflection on this complex question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravitation.
If it does not feel the terrestrial attraction, the organism does not form the skeleton or the muscular system.
It is not possible to dress an infant as an adult with a special combination for training.
He will simply be deprived of his vital needs.
"And this experiment that we would consider in this case by imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment will lead to the return to Earth of a disabled child, completely maladaptive," predicts the Director of the Committee for Bioethics of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
The birth of children in space is still a theory.
However, over time this will become a reality, when Earthlings travel in their shuttles to a distant planet that will become the habitat of their space-born offspring.
The head of the ISC (Superior Institution of Public Finance Control) said: "the control of pseudo-self-employment (in Czech "<0xC5><0xA0>varc system") has failed because of politicians.
In the area of public procurement, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and quality legislation, but it lags behind in its implementation.
This is what Miloslav Kala, the vice-president of the Supreme Audit Institution, said in an interview for Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and, in my opinion, that is what is lacking in us," Kala said in his commentary on the current situation.
A joint inspection by Czech and German inspectors also suggests similar conclusions.
He cites Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as's approach to the "<0xC5><0xA0>varc system" as an example of abusive practice.
The Prime Minister recently said that the SDGs are not going to bother entrepreneurs with controls, so is that allowed or prohibited?
“The law has to be enforced in one way or another, so if it prohibits something, even the head of government can’t stop an inspection authority from enforcing the law,” Kala said.
During the meeting of the Control Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you mentioned a Czech-German project in which the public procurement laws of these two countries were compared.
What was he talking about in concrete terms?
This is a parallel check that we launched about two years ago.
In simple terms, EU law provides for how to manage public procurement and specific national laws and practice itself.
We have put all this together and although this control procedure has not yet been completed, very interesting differences have appeared to us: generally speaking, our legislation is perhaps "more stringent and of better quality", nevertheless, according to some parameters, the practice as such is better in Germany.
This therefore confirms that it is not enough to continually develop more and more detailed rules but that it is necessary to devote oneself to the actual implementation of the law.
How can this project help you in a concrete way and what does it mean for you?
A common control of this kind should precisely help us to stop trying to clarify laws, to lower and improve thresholds, when it does not have a really positive effect.
The principle of good management means obtaining the thing in question at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest), in order to exclude any enrichment and possible criminal activity.
But by lowering the thresholds of the markets, we will not necessarily achieve this goal.
It may be that this system is so swamped by paperwork that those looking for loopholes will find far more opportunities than if the threshold had remained higher.
You are talking about internal problems concerning the implementation of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an institution similar to our SAI or a different mode of organization?
As for the institutions, similar to the ISC, the Bundesrechnungshof operates there, which is organized in a similar way, it also has a council constituted a little differently, but these two institutions basically proceed in a similar way.
The competences are also, to a certain extent, similar, with a nuance however in relation to our system: Germany being a federal structure, it therefore also has courts of accounts of this type at the level of the different L<0xC3><0xA4>nder.
The BRH can only control federal money, which in our case corresponds to state resources.
The public funds managed in our country by the regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of the courts of the L<0xC3><0xA4>nder.
As far as national legislation is concerned, is it simpler than ours?
I would not like to make a general comparison without concrete data, however, in some areas Germany is often referred to as a model but surely we cannot say that it does better in all areas.
Maybe it's because they have better inspectors?
No, certainly not, but I repeat, I do not have comparison data.
However, it must also be said that this country, which we consider a model, is also facing a whole series of problems.
Otherwise they wouldn't have any advantage in cooperating with our institution, would they?
As far as national legislation is concerned, what has the amendment of the Public Procurement Act meant to you as an institution, are its effects already being felt?
As this amendment has entered into force relatively recently, it has not yet had an impact on our control operations.
As we do post-checks, we have to reckon with a certain delay.
Our observations concern only, for the moment, the process of preparing the future controls - we have launched a new instrument of "detection of the risks of mismanagement" with which we have screened almost 14 000 public contracts - there these changes will of course be felt, because the thresholds have been modified as well as the conditions of certain types of tender procedures and so on.
Do you therefore consider the adoption of this law rather as an advantage or as an additional burden for the administration?
I think this legislation is a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will confirm that.
The problem that can arise is that these rules become more stringent and it is not possible to respect them.
Already under the previous regulations, the claimant (e.g. the Regional Council, in the case of the Regional Operational Programmes) required the audited subjects to accept that any breach of the Contracts Act would mean a breach of budgetary discipline.
So is it really useful to make the law tougher in this way?
No, not that way, I think.
The system must exclude those who want to attack the system or abuse it but not punish those who make formal mistakes with no consequence on the decision-making process.
Such a system will put more pressure on the administration.
So what is the solution to get out of it?
Let's look where we're not going.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS is not going to bother entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called <0xC5><0xA0>varc system - what does that mean?
Is the <0xC5><0xA0>varc system prohibited or allowed?
The law has to be enforced in one way or another, so if it prohibits something, even the head of government can't stop an authority from inspecting and enforcing the law.
He may declare, "We will change the law and authorize it," but he cannot say that we will act as if it were nothing.
The contract law contains relatively strict rules on the formalities to be completed, precisely in order to protect the tender.
But it is also tragic that a bidder is eliminated solely because of formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be just and that is, in my opinion, what is lacking in us.
The roads are in some places frozen, but most remain practicable.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and also snow-covered.
However, the network remains largely practicable, in some places with increased vigilance.
Karlovy Vary Region
In the Karlovy Vary region, the roads were practicable this morning, but in frozen and also snowy places.
Temperatures have dropped and oscillate between -5°C and -10°C but they should rise slightly during the day.
Snowfall has stopped in the area and only a thin layer of snow remains in the plains.
However, the ridges of the Kru<0xC5><0xA1>né hory (Metalliferous Mountains) are covered with about 30 centimetres of snow.
Data from the regional road maintenance service indicated that, due to fog, visibility was in some places reduced.
The R6 expressway and the national roads of the region are now easily accessible.
However, vigilance is still required, for example on some bridges whose coating can be frozen and slippery.
All departmental roads and third category roads, including mountain roads, are also passable.
Remains of frozen snow still remain on some of their sections and in places packed by traffic.
Especially in high-altitude areas, drivers need to be more vigilant.
Regions of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
The Directorate of Roads and Motorways reports on its website that some roads in East Bohemia are threatened by ice formation and that layers of snow packed with traffic may be on the roads in mountainous and high-altitude areas.
Road maintenance services warn drivers of the risk of ice formation in the high-altitude areas of the Pardubice region.
There may be ice in the vicinity of Lan<0xC5><0xA1>kroun, <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Orlic<0xC3><0xAD>, Poli<0xC4><0x8D>ka, Svitavy or Vysoké M<0xC3><0xBD>to, mainly on departmental and third category roads.
Routes I/43 and I/34 around Svitavy have been chemically treated.
Snow is mainly found in the Giant Mountains (Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e) and the Eagle Mountains (Orlické hory).
In the districts of Rychnov nad Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>nou and Trutnov, a layer of snow packed by traffic is present on the roads in the high-altitude areas.
In East Bohemia, the weather today will be very dry, mostly clear, with some clouds.
It will be a light wind and temperatures will generally fluctuate between -3°C and +1°C.
Pilsen Region
The roads in the Pilsen region are now passable, although in some places it is necessary to be more vigilant and to adapt one's driving to the weather conditions.
It is freezing this morning, temperatures oscillate between -3°C and -9°C.
After the last snowfall and the cooling that followed, some communication routes may be frozen in places.
Drivers can expect to pass through areas of fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is reflected in the information provided by the regional road maintenance service.
The D5 motorway is almost unimpeded, but road maintenance services recommend increased vigilance between 80 and 131 kilometres.
The pavement on most national roads is dry and frozen.
Some sections may be frozen in the South Pilsen district and in the Tachov district.
The departmental and third category roads are wet and in this case the warning against frozen sections applies.
Drivers need to be vigilant, especially on less busy roads in the <0xC5><0xA0>umava region.
Olomouc Region
Drivers travelling to the high-altitude areas of the Olomouc region now have to rely on a thick, soft layer of snow on the roads.
This layer remained on the so-called "<0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské sedlo" pass and on the road towards Videlsk<0xC3><0xBD> k<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xBE>, after the chemical treatment operations.
The snowfall forced road maintenance personnel to go to the field overnight; according to the road services, it fell more than three centimeters in the district of <0xC5><0xA0>umperk.
In other parts of the region, most of the roads are passable without difficulty.
On the heights of the district of <0xC5><0xA0>umperk there are remnants of snow.
Drivers driving in the direction of Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k should expect to encounter a thick and soft layer of snow at the so-called "<0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské sedlo" pass," the head of the <0xC5><0xA0>umperk district road maintenance services told <0xC4><0x8C>TK today.
Their colleagues from the Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k district also visited during the night; according to them, after the chemical treatment, the roads are now clear and wet, even in the highest areas.
In the district of Olomouc the roads are easy to drive, but in the district of <0xC5><0xA0>ternberk drivers should be careful in the sections in forested areas with wet roads.
Regions of <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem and Liberec
As early as this morning, the maintenance services of the roads of North Bohemia reported several difficult stretches.
According to police data, in addition to some places covered with snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Kn<0xC3><0xAD>nice na <0xC3><0x9A>stecku is closed.
Temperatures will remain below zero at lower altitudes, and therefore snow and ice should remain on the roads. In the plains, especially south-east of the Central Bohemian Plateau, there is, on the contrary, no problem and the roads are generally dry.
No traffic problems have been reported at this time.
Road maintenance services have reported the presence of ice, particularly in the vicinity of <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>t<0xC3><0xAD>.
According to meteorologists, the night conditions were ideal for its formation: rain and snowmelt during the day, clear skies and frost during the night.
There are also reports of difficult conditions on the national road 13 at the border between the regions of <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem and Liberec from the main traffic routes.
The closure of the traffic between Telnice and Kn<0xC3><0xAD>nice is due to branches of trees that bent under the weight of the snow until they reached the roadway.
<0xC5><0xA0>imon Ornest said: “In concert we want to collect positive energy.”
What do you think about the fact that in less than a month it should be the end of the world?
This is just one of those alarming news stories, the kind of traps we like to fall into.
In our group The Tap Tap, we laugh rather and we think that we are the only group able to collect a remnant of positive energy in order to repel or prevent the end of the world.
In addition, in December you are mounting a completely unique project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you explain this project in more detail to our readers?
This is a charity that we have been preparing for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced for December 21 at 11:10 am.
The day before, on December 20, three concerts will take place simultaneously, in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end almost as soon as the Mayan calendar ends on the island of Kiribati, which is in the Pacific Ocean, on a time zone 12 hours ahead of us.
Who came up with that idea?
At first I think it was my idea, then we designed everything with our creator, Honza Augusta.
Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want together, with the public, to reflect on the state of the world that we leave to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have created a collection of unique items, including shoes, T-shirts, bags, and original keys against the end of the world, by purchasing them online at www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The group The Tap Tap with other performers also recorded an anthem against the end of the world which is entitled "End of the world cancelled" (in Czech " Konec sv<0xC4><0x9B>ta zru<0xC5><0xA1>eno ").
It is already very popular on YouTube, will we hear it also during these charity concerts?
Of course, all in the end, finally, if we succeed and the end of the world does not take place...
It will be sung simultaneously by all performers in all three concerts.
The anthems will also come together at some point as part of a unique live Czech television program.
The lyrics of this song were written by Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Hanák who also plays the lead role of Jesus in the clip, Xindl X also sings in it...
How did you come to cooperate with them?
We collaborate with other personalities of the Czech show-biz, due to the fact that we organize numerous concerts and charitable events...
We strive to involve them intensively in these projects.
It turned out that most of them are interested in such cooperation and that it amuses them.
What are the benefits of these concerts against the end of the world?
To equip the Studeo training center which is accessible to people with reduced mobility and which we are working on within the framework of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka institute, with the Tap association, and that for six years.
Teachers regularly visit the students of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v Institute and offer them activities that interest and amuse them.
The students themselves do not have the means to go to classes, we try to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the construction of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, we will transfer this project to a new independent building.
Will several bands and performers take to the stage at each of these concerts?
By what criteria do you choose them?
We have tried to develop a program for all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Such<0xC3><0xBD> will take the stage.
Full details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Are you also preparing for other “mega events” of this kind in the future?
In May, we will play for the first time in the Prague Spring; there too, we will surely prepare a quality program with interesting guests.
We would also like to play next year at the house of the Czech Republic in New York and personally, once there in the United States, I would like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimalist, so far you have played for example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage the organization and logistics of your tours?
It’s not so bad that it looks like it at first.
We have five members in an electric chair whose gear must travel in the hold, of course we also carry a lot of luggage and boxes of instruments....
So far everything has more or less always gone well, <0xC4><0x8C>SA and British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, they surprised me more than once.
Even in Moscow, from where we recently returned, everything went smoothly.
Through your travels abroad, you can compare how these countries differ in terms of accessibility for people with reduced mobility, public attitudes towards people with disabilities and so on.
What have been your experiences so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than at home, we have just witnessed in Moscow that it is all still in an initial phase.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is still very inaccessible to people with disabilities; there, it is not yet common for a person to travel alone in an electric chair in the center of the city.
They do not yet consider it obvious to give priority to a person in a wheelchair in an elevator.
Fortunately, there too, an association was being set up to draw attention to the problems of persons with disabilities.
How do we still have to catch up with the more developed countries?
There are a lot of things we are still late for...
It is important to note that improvements and refinements always depend on the efforts of those involved.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with a heavy disability to move alone in public spaces; they can go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere...
It is still not very common there that a large number of people with disabilities actively participate in social life, on this point, you, The Tap Tap, are rather at the forefront of progress!
Respect for the public and ease of access are one thing, but the situation will really start to change when we have famous athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers among us.
At the moment, these are only isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular, let's go back a few years, what prompted you in 1998 to create this group?
I started working as an educator at the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, where I found myself surrounded by many young people willing to get involved in something.
And since I am a musician myself (I play, among other things, the saxophone), with a colleague, we created a music activity.
And then, with time, as our moderator Lá<0xC4><0x8F>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D> says, we lost a little control of the situation (laughs).
Success has only happened in the last few years, if I'm not mistaken?
It's true, connecting with well-known singers and actively working to promote the band has helped us.
We understood that if a work is not visible, it is as if it does not exist in the background.
Thanks to European Union grants, we can, in addition, afford to have quality teachers, equipment, and so on.
Were you aiming to reach such a level with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt there was potential to change things.
Show business is full of stuff that copies each other.
In a way, it makes sense: everything new is accepted with caution and it lasts a long time.
There are few original projects, and I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is naturally pity, it is natural ...
But pity is totally useless, because people with disabilities are not suffering beings, abandoned by all, whom we must take pity on.
These are people who can live a full life and thrive, provided they have the means to do so of course.
I often say that when people with disabilities achieve something, it is not only a breakthrough for them but for society as a whole.
Isn’t your success also due to the fact that you are a demanding leader, as you are qualified by many people?
If we want to do quality work, we have to be uncompromising in many areas and demand some discipline.
But I think that's perfectly normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and, when they realize that they have to come to rehearsals twice a week, take preparatory classes and spend a lot of time on the roads for concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But it works the same way in every group that wants to work and achieve goals.
The group The Tap Tap currently has twenty members.
How many were there in 1998?
Only one, Lá<0xC4><0x8F>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D>.
We're an open group, people come and go, we can't help it.
Our doors are always open to those who want or would like to join us.
This will be the case on the eve of the planned day of the end of the world, Thursday, December 20, 2012 from 9 p.m.
This action will take place in Prague in the Incheba arena, in Brno in Fléda and in Ostrava in Plynojem with the participation of twelve groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic.
At the end of the evening, these three cities will be connected by audiovisual relay when The Tap Tap’s song “End of the World Cancelled” will be sung together.
The aim of the concert is to raise funds (CZK 25 million) to equip the multifunctional Studeo training centre in Prague at the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute.
The price of a ticket to this concert is 400 CZK, admission is free for children up to 12 years, the presale of tickets is open at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of the Ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency, Poland was admitted as the twentieth member of this agency, it is the second member of the former Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland had started working closely with ESA in 1994 and in the following years participated in a number of ESA projects.
However, Poland's journey into space began much earlier.
Already before the Second World War, passionate Poles worked on space flights; they did not always meet with understanding.
I would like to mention, for example, the lecture given by A. <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld at the Astronomical Observatory in Warsaw on 6 December 1933, in which he presented ideas drawn from his avant-garde work entitled "Introduction to Astronautics".
The developments of this young engineer (born in 1905) left the listeners cold and years later <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prize in France for his book Introduction <0xC3><0xA0> l'astronautique.
The said doctor Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great propagator of astronomy and astronautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish newspapers and wrote many books devoted to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a world-renowned propagator of astronautics, his contribution was notably rewarded by the fact that his name was given to one of the craters on the far side of the Moon.
As early as 1925, a dragisine was built in Poland to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, neither the author nor the details of this project are known.
It is also unclear whether the rocket was to be used to propel or brake the dragisine.
The only known information about this drawing is that of the press at the time.
From 1933, the Polish artillery began to devote itself to rockets.
The research was conducted by the Kom<0xC3><0xB3>rka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in collaboration with Professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustaw Mokrzyckiego.
It appears from the documents retained that this research had reached the stage of testing.
Of course, with the arrival of the German armies, the search was interrupted.
In 1937, the plans of a photoelectric hunting rocket, drawn by the engineer Rohozi<0xC5><0x84>ski, appeared in the specialized press and the following year the book "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by an author named Leliwy-Krzywoblocki was published.
These two projects were intended for military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all projects for the use of rocket technology were carried out by the Provisional Scientific Advisory Committee ("Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy"), which coordinated all work.
This committee had been created in 1937, but after two years of operation, the beginning of the war put an end to its activities.
After the war, other works devoted to aeronautics were published in the Polish press, thanks to the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, a company is mentioned in the November 1954 issue of the newspaper Probl<0xC3><0xA8>me, in which there are four more detailed articles devoted to aeronautics.
In one of these articles, written by Professor M. Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a society dedicated to astronautics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was clear that the field of space research had a future.
In early 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) made efforts to join the International Astronautical Federation (established in 1951) and by the autumn the PTA became a regular member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became vice-president of the International Astronautical Federation.
He remained in office until his death in 1959.
From 1956, the PTA made a significant contribution to the successful development of the RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna) weather rocket, which became the first Polish rocket to conduct scientific research.
The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
This rocket with a range of 1800 meters had a length of 80 cm and weighed just under 5 kg.
Subsequently, an improved version, RM-1A, was built and, in the summer of 1959, flight tests of the two-stage RM-2 rocket began in the Bledov desert.
This rocket had a length of 1.4 meters and probably weighed 11.5 kg.
The next prototype should have been able to carry out concrete scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should have a range of up to 14.5 km and be used to observe the wind at altitude.
But in 1963, all development work was stopped.
The Meteor-1 rocket, developed during the period 1962-1965, succeeded the first RM-type rockets.
This rocket, designed with two stages, had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (named Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they were distinguished by the dimensions of the space reserved for scientific tools.
The Meteor-1A rocket had space with a volume of 0.4 liters, while in Meteor-1B this volume was 0.34 liters and in Meteor-1C 0.62 liters.
The maximum range of all these types of craft was 37 km.
In the period 1965 - 1968, the Meteor-2 rockets were developed in the aeronautical institute, the first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a payload of 10 kg at an altitude of about 60 km.
The Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were later built.
The entry of Poland into COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of a national COSPAR committee two years later should also be mentioned.
As part of the Interkosmos program, Poland also participated in space exploration on artificial Soviet satellites and, in 1978, the pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Remek, the second non-Soviet cosmonaut of this program.
Repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the Public Works Act.
This decision has given rise to much public discussion.
It is certainly interesting to look at this issue from a broader point of view.
Liberalised economic systems, both in the EU and in the context of globalisation, are based on the principle of more unregulated economic competition.
This means in practice that the different economic entities as well as the national economic systems are perpetually in conflict with each other.
This results from the principle of freedom of trade and the free (without limits) movement of private capital combined with unbridled financial speculation.
The considerable differences in the price of labour (wages) generate a pressure on prices.
The meaning of this term should be understood as follows: a producer endeavours, through the importation of goods sold cheaply, to resist economic competition by "making" the price of the competitor more expensive, with the aim of removing a greater share of the market and thus increasing his own profits.
On a large scale, this means for most entrepreneurs: either transferring production abroad, or buying cheaply, or disappearing. The result is significant unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and hence no responsibility for the unemployment it creates, the social charges of the State necessarily increase.
This whole situation intensifies the perfect unwillingness of the entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thus compensate for the economic and social damage caused to the whole of society by this race for profit.
This situation is so well known that it is not necessary to provide concrete statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital create in different economies a situation in which the governments of different countries are forced to engage in mutual competition in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital to them.
In other words, governments put their own people at the mercy of private capital without regard to social collapse.
This is manifested mainly in the amendments of the laws in force.
The objective is to economically force its own population to accept the diktat of private capital prices, especially in the field of wages.
This is due, on the one hand, to a system of economic constraints in the event of long-term unemployment and, on the other hand, to the restriction of the rights of employees in the field of labour legislation.
The result is growing poverty and deepening differences between the rich and the poor.
In the FRG, for years there have been public food distribution points for the poor who cannot provide for themselves with their own labour.
There are already millions of these people.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, it is becoming quite common for employees to receive such wages that the state is forced to pay a supplement so that they reach the subsistence minimum.
Such a scandal has been exposed, for example, in the case of employees working as auxiliaries in the federal parliament.
The economic measures of practically all the southern Member States of the EU undoubtedly generate a similar situation in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced either to emigrate (as was the case in the nineteenth century) or to live with poverty wages, on the margins of society, in the hope that one day private capital will be forced to emigrate.
The question here is: where will this capital come from?
If it comes from other EU countries, then poverty will pass from one country to another; this capital may not come either, or else a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, a Turk, a Moroccan, an Egyptian or an African will continue to work for a fraction of a European salary.
This also applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media claim, to tire of it, that the state cannot make capital investments in its own economy, that the directed economy leads to an economic catastrophe.
Private capital strongly defends the idea that the state cannot intervene in the economy through regulatory interventions.
It is then necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence and, even, does not today, according to its own selfish interests, direct politics and, by the same token, the entire State.
The answer to this question is undoubtedly yes.
The proof is that there is a virtually all-powerful lobby present in every state.
The result is a desperate situation manifesting itself in the field of corruption, through the granting of mutual advantages, in legislation, where everything is reprehensible but not punishable.
In the FRG, the situation is such that, due to the lack of financial resources, national ministries delegate the drafting of legislation to law firms closely linked to industry.
These bills are then passed in the Bundestag.
The totality of power does not come from the people, as Western-style constitutions declare, but from powerful financial groups serving their own interests.
It is clear that liberal-oriented democracies are now quickly confronted with the situation described by Appianos in his book entitled "The Crisis of the Roman Empire in the Times of Caesar and Pompey": "The state had long been in a state of decay and functions were attributed by violence.
Bribes, illegally obtained favors, and stones and swords were also used to obtain these positions.
The under-tables and corruption proliferated without limits and the people went to the elections with votes already sold"... "Honest people did not seek themselves in any way to obtain functions, it resulted once the state remained 8 months without consuls absolute".... ' It began to be said that the real remedy to this difficult situation was an autocracy, and that it was necessary to choose a 'c'
In conclusion, as in antiquity, present-day society is based on the preference for personal profit, without regard for the interests of society as a whole.
In its essence, private capital is no longer capable of understanding and asserting the interests of society as a whole.
The result, today as in the past, is an unprecedented decadence of elites, with no effort to carry out profound reforms.
We must therefore seek the causes of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in the unscrupulous liberalization of the economic systems of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
As things stand, the disappearance of these systems in favour of liberal democracies can be seen as a kind of pause before a new stage.
The fact that today's elites are completely unaware of the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future loss of life, the humanitarian and social crises of which we are now witnessing, as well as the crimes against humanity as we know them from ancient and recent history.
Repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least in the long term.
Under the pressure of economic competition, both at the international level and at the European level, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is indeed systemic.
The solution is socio-political reforms, which will strengthen state capital investment in the economy, increase citizens' influence over the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: Laboratory of Chaos.
"Nothing will ever come out of the violence and never can," Sting says in the song titled Fragile, whose main line of the chorus is "let's not forget how fragile we are."
“If my sons did not want wars, there would be no wars,” said Gutele Schnaper, Mayer Amschel Rothschild’s wife on her deathbed in 1849.
Following the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, there has been a lot of backlash.
Some take the side of Israel, arguing for its right to self-defence and putting the Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, invoking the racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against the Arabs of Palestine and considering Israel a terrorist state.
I do not want to reflect on the question of who is guilty and who is the victim, in its waves of recurrent killings; all in all, the current inhabitants of Israel, including those of the autonomous territories, were born in the present political situation and did not experience the beginning of the violence.
I would like to offer readers a "behind the curtain" view of those who mainly benefit from the tensions that have already persisted for more than 95 years (starting with the Balfour Declaration in 1917) in a small part of the Middle East.
Some of these reflections are based on historical facts available for study, others emerge from my own understanding of the one, or more exactly the group of individuals, who is the main instigator of events in modern history.
The history of mankind is first and foremost the history of a struggle for power.
In every age, we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether these individuals acted independently or whether they owed their actions on the throne to someone who directed their actions according to pre-defined objectives.
We must admit that we live in a time when global wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this financial concentration generating certain powers could not be done in a single generation.
Among the families with astronomical wealth stands out particularly the Rothschild family, which could be considered as the head of the octopus (I do not know if these families still have a leader but I do not exclude it).
Very little is written about them.
Of course you do.
As early as the 1990s, they acquired the world's first news agency (Reuters) in order to put an end to the establishment of links between their name and serious criminal acts in which they were involved and which had always meant for them a strengthening of their power, an increase in their fortune or both.
They own major holdings in almost most of the world's central banks and are preparing or waging wars against countries in which they do not yet have such holdings (before the invasion of Afghanistan the number of these countries was 7, after the invasion of Iraq 5, after the overthrow of Gaddafi only 4, meanwhile Russia placed the central bank in control).
Anyone who tried to stand up to this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the Bank of America of the Rothschilds as a central bank and began issuing his own money during the civil war (government, I hear) and was assassinated in a theater in 1865.
JFK began issuing his own money and wanted to dissolve the Fed; he was assassinated in 1963; Congressman Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 when he wanted to sue the Fed for having triggered the great economic crisis of 1929.
Their thirst for world-wide power led in the years 1859 to 1871 to the formulation of a plan of three world wars by Albert Pike, a Freemason initiated at the 33rd degree, being the highest level.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great state monarchies of Europe, the second was to suppress colonialism, especially British, and the third was to reduce the world population between 1 and 0.5 billion individuals (such a quantity of slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), create a single universal religion (ecumenism being nothing more than the beginning of such a final solution).
The method used by the clan of the richest families headed by the Rothschilds is to create a crisis and then propose a solution (order ab chaos - the order following chaos).
These solutions are false and always lead to an aggravation of the situation (see the creation of the FED intended to prevent the recurrence of crises such as those they caused in 1907).
After successfully triggering World War I by the assassination in Sarajevo of Ferdinand, Habsburg heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, they destroyed Tsarist Russia by provoking the Bolshevik Revolution.
The First World War ended abruptly with a German capitulation without economic and military justifications (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of Tsarist Russia) and it was followed by the fragmentation of Austria-Hungary, the power of Central Europe.
For an easier outbreak of the Second World War, the bankers allowed the politicians to create a situation of latent conflict: on the one hand, they imposed on Germany enormous war reparations, thus generating the conditions for a radicalization of the impoverished masses (they then had to place a strong enough leader, pointing out the culprits, proposing simple solutions) and, on the other hand, to create a radicalization of the poor masses.
In the late 19th century, the Rothschilds inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, one of whose branches aspired to the creation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of historic Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration mentioned above laid the groundwork for a massive emigration of Jews to Palestine and the first frictions with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist acts were committed on both sides.
The Second World War broke out; it is difficult to assess whether Hitler broke the chains in which the international bankers had initially held him; or if everything he did was planned, the fact is however that the suffering of the Jews of Europe in the concentration camps created the basis for the acceptance of a Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; in the same way that the war reparations imposed on Germany were at the origin of the Second World War, the foundation of the State of Israel ignited a fire that could provoke a Third World War.
If the international bankers manage to trigger this war, the Jewish population will be as it was during the Second World War, the first victim of the fighting, this time as well as the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, the source of discord and chaos, not only in this country, but internationally (suffice it to see how people bitterly divide themselves between supporters and defenders of Israel).
Who is guilty and who is a victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where one wrong begets another wrong in a circle of endless violence and where, at the root of it all, is the greed of certain individuals and their desire to gain power over the whole world?
It is necessary here to distinguish between the ordinary citizens of Israel and their leaders, because, as in our country, international bankers only propose their own candidates to the people in elections.
The current prime minister of Israel is a typical example of a fascistic politician, loyal to international bankers, who does everything in order to trigger a war with Iran, which could, due to the accession of this country to the Shanghai cooperation organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc.) expand to become a world conflict and, given that Iran's control of the world can only be carried out by the world wide (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc.)
In what light now appears the words of David Rockefeller in 1994: “The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order.”
In their view, the New World Order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which a handful of finance aristocrats are served by the rest of the human population.
A world in which every newborn is implanted at birth an electronic chip making him a totally controlled being.
“Let them compel all individuals, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to bear on their hands or foreheads a mark with a red iron, so that he may neither buy nor sell him who does not bear the name of this ferocious beast or the number of his name.
It must be understood: that he who has good sense counts the numbers of this ferocious beast.
This number designates the man, and it is six hundred and sixty-six."
The movie Argo: when everything goes wrong, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a mob of Islamist student protesters stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had fled to the United States, which had supported his regime for several decades.
The situation did not offer the US administration a positive outcome, it could not, in fact, abandon the Shah, because it would have seriously shaken the confidence of its allies in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was unable to secure the release of the hostages.
It was a hard blow to the prestige of the United States, a blow further aggravated later by the fiasco of the attempted release of the hostages by force.
The kidnapped diplomats were finally released 444 days later, following negotiations organized by the Algerian government.
Their fate aroused in the United States a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment.
The Iranian debacle contributed greatly to Jimmy Carter's defeat by Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo, by actor and director Ben Affleck, describes an episode of this story that offered a small victory to America.
Just before she was occupied, six employees escaped from the embassy.
After complicated adventures, they found themselves in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get them out of Iran through a fantastic cover: they left the country with Canadian passports as members of a film crew who came to do scouting for the shooting of a movie to great science fiction show.
Combining genders
Exfiltration expert Tony Mendez's plan required Hollywood's collaboration.
In order to make the legend more credible, specialized magazines reported on this film project, press conferences were organized and a fictitious production company had real offices.
The details of the operation remained secret for a long time, the film being based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is an unusual combination of several genres.
It is not only a realistically conceived political thriller but also a "caper movie", the story of a successful coup, a betrayal - as, for example, in the Ocean's eleven, twelve and thirty trilogy.
The atmospheres follow one another: documentary-style sequences from Tehran (in the subtitled sequences are presented iconic photographs of the time of the events and the way in which, thanks to these photos, these same situations were transcribed in the film, there are no big differences),
lighter Hollywood passages, treated with irony and a bit of exaggeration,
and then scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions with costumed men discussing the situation around conference tables, in the corridors and on the phone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in a remarkable way.
As a ridiculed actor, he became a respected director and his acting ceased to elicit ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after the dark policeman "Gone Baby Gone" (2007) and the thriller "The Town" (2010).
It is also Affleck's first film not set in his hometown of Boston.
The sense of atmosphere of a place is one of the characteristics that placed his first films above Hollywood standards.
Affleck also demonstrates this sense of atmosphere in Argo where Tehran's role "is held" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, during the reconstruction of real facts; the initial sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive by its clarity which also suggests the confusion and unpredictability occurring when suddenly, in a given place, a page of history is written.
Affleck and his collaborators achieve a similar effect in the fictional scenes (the fake film crew in the Tehran bazaar).
Too many actions in too many places
The director had to settle for a subject that actually offers few thrilling scenes, in the cinematographic sense of the term.
It does very well, it sometimes adds some elements to reality and there, the result is not always as elegant (the scene in which the threat of crisis at Tehran airport is dismissed by a phone call in America and the pursuit on the runway are quite far-fetched).
Argo's weakness lies in its dissipated character, due to the need to show too many events in too many different places.
If it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are quite charming in their role as Hollywood cooperators, their characters would have deserved a bigger place and they are not, far from it, the only ones in this case.
Affleck's film lacks a bit of dramatic tension, he lets himself be seen with moderate interest, appreciating the direction and retro style of the 70s.
It draws the viewer in, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of a history still, in a way, unfinished to this day, and as an illustration of the exaggerated character of the representation of the secret services as omnipotent and omniscient, it does the trick.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circus
The www.bankovnipoplatky.com server, which annually conducts a public inquiry into the most absurd bank charges, has now decided to launch the contest of the most absurd regulation or ideas coming from the "EU workshop".
"The fact that the EU is considering in recent times to adopt a quota of 40 percent of women for the management of large European companies was at the origin of our decision," said the organizer of this survey, Patrik Nacher.
Among the absurdities mentioned, there is already, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify insurance premiums for men and women.
Until now, however, women have benefited from life insurance rates because, objectively, they represent a lower risk for insurance companies.
People can report until the end of the year any other such incredible idea of the "EU workshop".
"The vote will take place before the end of February 2013," Nacher said.
Controversial EU regulations include, for example, the obligation to add organic components to fuels, which has harmful consequences for the environment, or the ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers, simply because they contain a relatively small quantity of a dangerous substance, or the chicken cage size directive, which has led to the increase in prices.
There have also been criticisms in the past of the de facto ban on the use of the term "sandwich butter" or the withdrawal from the sale of conventional light bulbs.
Quality bananas should be 14 centimetres in size.
The European administration often reacts under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby whose demands are usually defended in Brussels by a state or a group of states (thus the Czech Republic is currently imposing the demands of its banks by threatening to use its veto right).
The interests of lobbyists are also, for example, at the root of the fact that in the Union bananas must not be less than 14 cm in size or have an "abnormal curvature".
The European Commission defended itself by arguing that it was merely harmonising non-homogeneous national standards that made trade more difficult.
The standards for fruit and vegetables have been relaxed despite opposition from some Member States, claiming that existing directives lead to food waste.
The first prize may be awarded in this survey to last year's EU regulation that air balloons must include a warning that children under 8 years old must not inflate without adult supervision.
The EU referred to a US investigation which found that balloons are the leading cause of death of children from choking among toys.
A similar restriction applies to children under 14 years of age when blowing fair trumpets.
At home, too, we have strange ideas.
The following rule concerning European officials themselves is quite absurd: due to the sensitivity of this theme for Greece, anyone with an official function within the EU cannot use the name "Macedonia" and must instead speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with the association "Laissez Faire" of liberal economists, the Bankovn<0xC3><0xAD>poplatky.com server appointed in this investigation, in addition to some of the absurdities mentioned above, the Union regulation concerning the volume of food reserves on the territory of the Czech Republic.
The EU had set maximum volumes for food stocks that could be on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the volumes set for canned mushrooms and risked a heavy fine.
The organizers of this survey found the idea of paying money to some countries because they do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a grant to apply for grants interesting.
These ideas, however, do not originate in Brussels but in Prague.
"The fact that we don't have a sea handicaps us.
In the autumn of 2004, the then Minister of Agriculture, Jaroslav Palas (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD), said that he would ask the European Union for a refund.
He argued that, because of our wheat production, and because of so-called "interventionist" purchases, the state had found itself with full stocks which it had to export.
According to Palas, the EU should have paid us millions of euros, because the Czech Republic is far from the ports.
In the end, the European Commission responded positively to the Czech demand and organised a call for tenders for the purchase of wheat from countries without maritime access.
The grants for obtaining grants were proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development led by the Minister Pavel N<0xC4><0x9B>mec (US-DEU), these were, concretely, to be used to draft grant applications granted by Brussels.
The EU says: "weird regulations are rare".
While the regulations are often criticised in the Member States, according to many experts, the EU's efforts to regulate and improve the effectiveness of the Union's functioning and its overall development deserve praise.
More serious is, for example, the problem of using EU subsidies for projects that have absolutely nothing to do with strengthening European integration, but which have been imposed by the Member States during the budget negotiations, according to experts.
The fact that the Czech Republic, like other EU countries, has to fight in Brussels for the right to use specific names for these traditional products (a struggle from which it does not always emerge victorious) arouses strong emotions among Czechs.
If at the end of six years of battle against the Germans and the Austrians, the Czechs successfully defended the name "Olomoucké tvar<0xC5><0xAF><0xC5><0xBE>ky", as for the appellation "Tuzemsk<0xC3><0xBD> rum" which dates back to us in the nineteenth century, our producers had to replace it with the name "Tuzemák".
Only products based on cane sugar alcohol, and not on beet sugar, may bear the name rum.
In the official list of registered products of the EU, we find today in the company of world-famous cheeses such as Feta or Gorgonzola, L<0xC3><0xBC>beck marzipan or Parma ham, Karlovy Vary ("Karlovarské sugary") biscuits, Poho<0xC5><0x99>elice and T<0xC5><0x99>ebo<0xC5><0x88> carp ("Po<0xC5><0x99>e<0xC5><0x88>ub<0xC5><0x88>").
Pardubice gingerbread ("Pardubick<0xC3><0xBD> pern<0xC3><0xAD>k") and cakes called "Ho<0xC5><0x99>ice croissants" ("ho<0xC5><0x99>ické trubi<0xC4><0x8D>ky") can also be proud of their Community trade mark.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur, says Senator Okamura
Senator, how do you propose to run in the presidential election?
It's not being a senator or president that matters to me.
If everything worked smoothly in our country, I would not be a candidate anywhere.
But I can no longer bear to see how the country has been looted for the past twenty years, that thieves are not under lock and key and the retirement age is rising.
I didn’t have the ambition to become a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, then I try to find a way to make it change.
And since I am over forty years old and I am independent, a member of no party, I have no other way to influence the situation than to run in presidential or senatorial elections.
You entered the Senate but you quickly set off for the Castle. (Editor’s note: Chair’s seat).
Do you not turn your backs on those who have elected you?
I've always said I'll go into battle for the Castle based on the results of the Senate election.
Later, I made it clear that if I were elected senator, I would run in the presidential election.
My goal is not the function, it is only an instrument allowing me to realize my vision.
That is why I need the greatest influence and the broadest mandate.
The problem is not only that as a nation we grumble at the bar or in front of our television set, but also that we stomp on all those who are trying to bring about change.
Added to this is the press that breaks the reputation of people and confuses freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
For example, it was said about me that I bribe journalists or that I was an adviser to Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Paroubek.
Let’s come to your visions.
You started the fight for the Castle with the themes of the material and criminal liability of politicians and retroactive tax returns beyond twenty million [CZK] as a workhorse.
To that end, you need to change the law.
As president, you do not have that power, and only the Senate as a whole can propose legislation.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When, as a citizen, I lobbied for tour guide activities to be a liberal profession, I won.
The problem is politicking: when someone comes from the left or the right with a good project, it is knowingly refused and delays the citizens.
As an independent, not a member of any party, I have a much better chance of getting the support of all parliamentary parties.
I have the advantage of being able, without partisan categorization and dogma, to take from each party what is best for our country and implement it.
Do you see yourself as a right or a leftist?
From a Czech point of view, I have the impression that people place me rather on the left.
For me, whether it's a little left or right, it's not really important.
The important thing for me is that we move forward.
What matters to me is not that people are left-wing or right-wing, but that we bring people together.
I always support any solution that contributes to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party or ODS and I act equally impartially against bad ideas.
Do you get angry when someone says you are a populist?
But doesn't what you said prove it?
When you develop a business plan in a company, you also have a certain optimal goal and vision.
You're trying to get close to it.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I speak of have been applied by the world and recognized experts have spoken about it.
But without the support of parliament, all you have left are slogans.
You won’t survive long in politics with this.
Do you think that if you go to see people and talk to them, you will succeed, for example, in imposing material and criminal responsibility?
I don't have any other options.
I need to convince politicians, journalists and public opinion and try to rally them to my side in order to impose it.
If I were elected president, it would not be a problem to broadcast live on television my request to the presidents of parliamentary parties to legislate on the material and criminal responsibility of politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
They should then eventually explain why they don’t want it.
When there is a strong personality who will identify the abuses, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take for example the election of the president by direct suffrage, it was obtained thanks to the pressure of public opinion.
I confess, without ambiguity, to be an amateur, and not a genius or an intellectual.
I try to find allies for my opinions and visions.
I just got into politics and I'm trying to get the support of the majority for my program.
I'm trying to get things done on my own, and if that doesn't work, I'll quit in six years and go back to the private sector.
It's almost as if Okamura is going to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a saviour.
I know that one person cannot make a difference, which is why I went to see a number of personalities and asked them to stand in the Senate elections as well.
I met Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, but he refused because of the amount of work.
I at least supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová who exposed the fuel frauds.
I introduced myself because people are really unhappy but now I hesitate.
Sixty percent of the people did not vote and what did, for the most part, gave their vote to a representative of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are just two independents.
The people have elected a Senate that can hardly impose change.
In spite of everything, I will fight for my vision, for example the election by direct suffrage of mayors and prefects of regions.
Are you planning to start your own party?
No, not yet, because I don't have time to check if every potential member's past is spotless and then I don't have the financial means.
I don’t have any money for my presidential campaign either, I only have twenty thousand in my “transparent” account.
Don't you have any money?
If you’re talking about tax returns, what’s yours?
I estimate the value of my personal property to be about $60 million.
I have in Prague a plot of land worth 25 million, an apartment worth 10 million, another apartment worth 8 million, a collection of works of art worth about 10 million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a <0xC5><0xA0>koda Superb worth 1 million and a few million on my account.
By the way, I own an Aston Martin, because it was a kid’s dream: I’ve always loved James Bond, who drove cars, was gallant with women and fought against evil and abuse.
You drive an Aston Martin, you have a fortune worth $60 million and you don't have any money for your campaign?
You want to change the Republic but you don’t want to invest your own money in it?
That's not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million for this campaign.
Should I go into debt?
I've already invested two and a half million in the campaign.
The fact that I do not have any sponsors shows that my program does not generate much interest.
I don't have to pay for this campaign out of my own pocket.
My campaign expenses are generally covered by the compensation I will receive as a senator.
But I couldn't afford it, like paying for my son's English school, which costs 30 grand a month.
If my only goal was to make money, I will not stand for election.
So you're going to continue your business activities so you can live?
Didn't you say you'd put your activities on hold?
But this is not related to the amount of this remuneration.
As promised, I have partially reduced my activities.
For example, my assistant will take over the travel agency in the spring.
People would like me to be a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to live on something.
What was your usual monthly salary when you were an entrepreneur?
I won and I continue to win between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I were president, I would end my business.

The architects of the firm MVRDV prove that true adventures are not just a matter of imagination. To be convinced, just look at Spijkenisse and the newly erected mountain of books - 2 photos
"I think this building is funny, it's very futuristic, finally something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby on the side of the street.
Stefan Spermon, a computer scientist at a large company nearby, tells us: "Yes, it is indeed beautiful, this building".
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
Everyone has the Internet, an iPad, and e-books.
Today, no one goes voluntarily to one of these nerdy libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a dormitory town that has nothing attractive about the gates of Rotterdam, holds a rather special record.
The 80,000-strong municipality has the lowest education rate in the Netherlands.
In order to give some neurons back to the brains, the city decided, a few years ago, to contribute to the general culture and to reproduce the seven fictitious bridges that appear on the euro banknotes in the form of pretty small miniatures in painted reinforced concrete.
The success of the cultural offensive remained limited.
This is how the city authorities realized that there was only one way to regain control over the statistics: the construction of a library!
Winy Maas of the Rotterdam architectural firm MVRDV, master of bold stick diagrams and creator of witty and often cynical buildings, accepted the project with his usual phlegm and entered the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a snicker on his face.
And while the members of the jury were still looking at each other, bewildered and shrugging their shoulders, Maas, the cheeky one, stacked his choice books in order of size to make a pyramid, and ended his speech supported by activist arguments with one: "common dear!"
Here it is, my proposal for the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, or as they say, the Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain of 30 million euros has sprung from the ground.
The building is part of a revitalization project that also includes underground parking, a supermarket, a post office and some buildings and terraced houses for a total of 50 homes.
At the beginning of November, the mountain of books received the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project was selected for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Thus, this drab little town, which until today had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian area and a town hall of mind-boggling ugliness, whose white facades suggest that they are home to a dairy, has been enriched with a contemporary architectural work.
Most importantly, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The Long Road to Reading
First impression: Eldorado of the book under a cheese bell.
Certainly, an elevator transports you to the heart of the massif, but the real joys of reading and architecture open up to you when you step on the ground of the building to discover its topography.
The interior made entirely of glass is bright and clear, the Dutch brick floor and elegant streetlights speak unequivocally the language of municipal public squares.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
We are already looking for public benches, dogs and little boys and girls who play with the ball.
And everywhere books, books and more books.
“Normally, library shelves are located along the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade and in the middle is a large, dark room, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal,” says Maas.
We have completely overturned the classical spatial configuration and opened the reading spaces from the inside out.
The interior of the mountain of books has been skillfully arranged: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the center for the environment and the technical central building.
A particular beauty lies in the black shelves of the library, which are sometimes paneling, sometimes balustrades, sometimes staircase ramps.
A new experience for sight, touch and smell.
Even hardened architects and building engineers don’t want unknown materials.
“We wanted to work with recycled materials,” says Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality of Spijkenisse, in a response to the Standard.
This is how one day we found in a Frisian agricultural company an ad hoc waste from agriculture.
In the Netherlands, synthetic membrane one millimetre thick has been used for years as a substrate in greenhouses and fields.
It is cheap and saves time.
The thin membrane is used for one or two seasons, then it can be discarded.
For the library, the membrane was compressed, for the first time in such quantities, into plates with a thickness of four centimeters.
Under the effect of heat and pressure, the "Landbouwplastic" (KPL) changes color and turns into a dark, homogeneous and resistant material, the smell of which evokes both a new car and sports shoes.
At the top of the 105 steps is the top of the mountain.
At the end of almost 500 meters, the literary café offers us a breathtaking view of the city, but also Dutch croquettes and ficus in pots.
The latter create an atmosphere, but they contribute above all to the maintenance of the ideal level of humidity of the air of the literary mountain.
Gifts for the New Soul
“It’s incredible, but despite all the glass surfaces, this building is a model project in terms of ecology,” says Trouborst.
The temperature of the building is regulated by geothermal energy.
Although the mountain of books is located below a glass bell, the sun only illuminates the interior for a short time, even on sunny days.
The thick wooden beams mounted at right angles to the glass fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade serve as a sun visor, intercepting a large part of the rays.
The atmosphere is very pleasant.
Fully automated blinds take care of the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the aforementioned septic computer scientist, has already risked entering the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
Cynthia Bogarde, professor of traditional Chinese medicine, even describes the Boekenberg as "the soul finally found" of Spijkenisse.
A few weeks ago, during the inauguration, each citizen was invited to donate a book from his personal library.
This measure made it possible to fill the gaps in the library that was not yet completely filled (today it has 70,000 books).
The concept is a success.
The rays are overflowing on all sides.
Architect Winy Maas once said, “There is nothing worse than a half-empty library.”
"I believe our invitation has created a certain relationship between each citizen and this new building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this edifice.
Even if it's just for decoration."
This is how MVRDV has achieved the master discipline that is called, in professional jargon, "the creation of an identity".
Spijkenisse has written a new page of literary history.
She may seem young and uneducated.
Finally, it is a new starting point for the birth of an identity.
Szabo: "The Germans must play a bigger role."
Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of the Palestinian state.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-EU relations, this decision puts Berlin in a delicate political situation.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany announced its intention to vote against the Palestinians’ request for observer status at the United Nations.
But then she chose to abstain.
Why is that?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not approve of what the Israelis did in Gaza.
However, Berlin needs to be cautious, as it has special relations with Israel.
But I also don't think it supports the American position.
Germany wanted to assert its independence, but was not overly critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany had also chosen to abstain in the vote on the establishment of a no-fly zone.
In the end, NATO imposed this measure.
Is Germany having difficulty in taking a clear position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason for this is that Berlin is in the process of reviewing its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a policy as it were defined by the Americans and to establish a German foreign policy.
Moreover, the lack of a coherent and common policy within the Union complicates the situation.
The Germans faced several fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I believe they are still groping for this role, but are on the way to a "more normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, as in France or Great Britain
What, then, does the term “normal” foreign policy actually mean for the Germans?
It shows a willingness to adopt positions independent of those of the United States and European partners, including on national issues.
I believe that German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, therefore by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are, to some extent, different from those of the other major powers: that is why Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced Germany's position on the conflict in the Middle East and its abstention in the United Nations vote?
Germany initially had important opportunities in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries.
That is why Berlin must be careful not to offend public opinion, but also the elites of the Arab countries.
This is undoubtedly a determining factor.
However, I would not attach too much importance to it, because it is not an exclusively one-sided relationship.
But this is in any case a decisive element in German strategic thinking.
Is Germany harming its relations with the United States by choosing to abstain in important votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I think the Europeans and the Americans understand the German position perfectly.
That is why I believe that the fracture is not as serious as it was in the case of the Libyan question.
Perhaps even Germany will be more respected.
Indeed, Germany has thus demonstrated that it must be taken seriously as an international actor and that its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, opinions regarding the Palestinian initiative are diverse.
The United States, on the other hand, announced its veto in a clear voice.
Do opinions differ between the United States and the majority of European countries?
There have always been differences because of the domestic American political scene.
I believe that the Obama administration is secretly showing a great deal of understanding for the European position.
But given the political configuration of the country, the government cannot of course defend its position publicly.
I believe that the real differences of opinion are not so great as they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is far from over-enthusiastic about Netanyahu’s policy.
Is Germany having difficulty reconciling its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of the major European partners, on the other?
I don't think that makes it easy for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, but today this is not the case.
They cannot therefore be part of a broader political line and must assert their singular position.
This is what they are currently doing on the euro issue.
In my opinion, Germany will take on a locomotive role in the future and push Europe to adopt a European position.
It is not easy for Germany, especially because of relations with Israel.
This question has always been a delicate one.
But in my opinion, the Germans are well aware of the fact that they must play a role that further marks their independence.
Does Germany see itself as a major player on the international stage, does Germany only want to play a key role?
Or does she still have difficulty taking on leading roles?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still uncomfortable, and for obvious reasons it is still struggling to play a bigger role.
If we look, for example, at the euro crisis, we notice that whenever Germany decides to weigh more, many anti-German sentiments are heard.
This does not make things easier for the Germans.
In fact, it is always the same problem: we do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more delicate position than the United States.
She has to deal with very diverse neighbors and opinions, and it's not easy.
Today, the influence of the United States on European politics is only diminishing, but at the moment, the EU is not filling this gap, so who is left?
The Germans will just have to play a bigger role.
And even if they do not like it, even if it is unpleasant to them and even if they are not appreciated, this is life!

Brand protection in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are well-known brands around the world.
Armani Polo... what is it really about?
Behind this name hides a trademark officially registered in China, but which has nothing to do with the original company.
The trade mark thus enjoys such protection that the undertaking bearing its name cannot lodge a complaint.
And even if she could, he's not sure she'd win the case.
“It’s becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China,” said Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer with the law firm Taylor Wessing who specializes in property infringement in the Far East.
Every week, a new file arrives on my desk.
Imitators only need a few extra letters to be able to register their trademarks.
So instead of Gucci, we record Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada, we record Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied, such as Puma, the manufacturer of sporting goods.
Pattloch opens a filing cabinet containing the registrations made with the Beijing Trademark Office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company filed the trademark Zegna DF Puma, a name that the firm artificially created by appropriating part of the name of Ermenegildo Zegna, the fashion house.
It is a known fact that the Chinese have become the world champions of copying and infringement of intellectual property.
In large cities, there are multi-storey shopping malls that sell practically only counterfeit goods.
Pattloch's cases, however, are different: his constituents instruct him to address the fact that the Chinese Trademark Office officially grants Chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected in another country.
The Chinese speak of "Bang Mingpai", a related brand.
The term is derived from "Bang Dakuan".
It is with this term that women who marry rich men are referred to.
The Chinese authorities say they have nothing to complain about.
“It’s bad for business, you have to fight this trend,” Pattloch said.
“The brand is watered down, the uniqueness disappears, the damage to reputation is huge.”
Financial losses and court costs are in the millions for the sectors concerned, especially for expensive flagship products.
According to data from market analysis firm CLSA, China represents, with an annual volume of 15 billion euros, the world’s third-fastest-growing and fastest-growing luxury goods market.
However, it is not easy to remove dubious registrations from the trademark register and these procedures are expensive.
The latter can last up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain.
Pattloch recounts the trials in which the court dismissed the complaint, because after a long time, the criticized denomination had become a “market reality.”
Pattloch explains that if the complainant is unlucky, he may even be forced to pay money to the plagiarist because it would have harmed his brand in China.
In this area, it is sometimes the law of the jungle that dominates.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal battle against the construction machine manufacturer Sany, the same company that had just bought the concrete pump producer Putzmeister.
This is the reason why the Chinese can use an emblem that looks like the Mercedes star.
Geely, the buyer of Volvo, used a blue and white logo that resembled that of BMW. The conflict was settled and Geely had to change it.
The fashion house Lacoste had lost against plagiarists from Hong Kong and Singapore who had reoriented the look of the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
According to the Chinese authorities, they are not guilty of anything.
The CTMO trademark office in Beijing admits, however, to having experienced some difficulties in 2010 due to a lack of staff and space.
However, the office would have gone last year from an "emergency situation in the course of the work to a normalcy regained".
Thus, the number of untreated opposition proceedings would have decreased by 22%.
Nearly 57,000 such cases would have been closed, representing a 75% increase over the previous year.
However, 81,500 cases are still pending at the Office.
Acting is expensive
As is often the case in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
According to the office, this is a record and means that China is at the top of the ranking for the tenth time in a row for the number of new deposits in the world.
This would also apply to the total number of legal marks, which is 5.5 million.
In 2011, the office reportedly accounted for 1.8 billion yuan of registration fees.
In other words, each record brought in an average of 1,280 yuan, or 160 euros.
A legal battle costs much more, as illustrated by the case of the German family business Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting a Chinese plagiarist.
Admittedly, the Germans were able to get the illegal manufacture of vehicle components suspended.
However, the imitator was able to maintain its Chinese rights to the Freudenberg trademark.
“It’s our fault, because surnames cannot be protected in Germany,” explains Hanno Wentzler, CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The trade mark office had therefore rejected the Munichers' objection.
Freudenberg won the case in the following two instances, but the opposing party continues to fight to this day.
Vigilance is required
Today, the case is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident, he believes in a positive outcome of the trial and praises the professionalism of the judges.
Nevertheless, he adds: "the procedure is long, grueling and costs us a lot of time and money."
It is also difficult to assess internal costs, and the archives department has even had to review the actions of the last hundred years in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg even proposed in vain to the opposing party a "large six-figure euro sum" to settle the dispute.
“That’s what it means to us,” Wentzler says.
The dangers of the Far East even threaten to spill over into Europe.
This would be the case if imitators of this region were to ensure the exploitation of unprotected marks.
For example, a Chinese producer wanted to file in Germany the name Freudenberg for a shoe and leather production company.
The company had long since abandoned this sector, but it had still been able to prevent the filing.
Wentzler adds: "vigilance is in order."
Pattloch and he advise German companies to exercise great caution in their trade relations with China.
It is not enough, according to them, to rely on international trademark law, foreigners should rather "also register in China everything that is likely to be protected", as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, the costs can be much higher than those of registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg lost the battle in the last act of his legal drama, the company would have to pay licensing fees to the opposing party for the use of its own name, as Wentzler explains.
Otherwise, we would lose our place in the segment of the market in question.
World AIDS Day: kicking, singing, helping
The Imbongi choir repeats in Heidelberg, and the AIDS orphans of Swaziland rejoice at their arrival.
This is the story of a link that spans far more than a distance of 8,733 kilometers.
First, we kick: cowboy boots, sneakers, women's pumps and men's moccasins look for rhythm by hitting the floor of the foot. Very quickly, they find it.
One, two, three, four.
Then, the singers' voices slowly amplify - alto, bass, tenor and soprano -, they go wild, bewitch and follow each other.
Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor almost loses his canvas shoes when he conducts the orchestra with his wildly flexible gestures.
It’s Monday night, the Imbongi choir is rehearsing a new song in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg.
Fifty singers from 23 to 69 years old have come, from the geneticist in human medicine to the homemaker.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy song, each chorister has different lyrics, all in a very exotic language: Zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Being Helped to Help Yourself
UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS programme, estimates that 34 million people worldwide are affected by the disease.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 infected people.
In addition, more than 40% of the population is HIV-positive.
180 AIDS orphans from the village of Esitjeni found sponsors in Germany thanks to the association "Voices for Africa".
70 of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros less, you can become a sponsor.
This amount guarantees the child money for school, a school uniform and a daily hot meal at the gogo center.
Imbongi means in Zulu "storyteller" or "singer of praise".
No one can speak the Bantu language fluently in this region, but everyone can sing it.
For almost 10 years, the choir has been repeating songs in this foreign language that it brought to Germany to now return to its native region: the South of Africa.
For at 8,733 kilometers in a bird's eye view of Heidelberg, in the North-West of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is Esitjeni, the village that depends on the vocal power of the German choir.
40% of people affected
The village has about 2,000 inhabitants, some living in modest straw or earth huts and the majority of them are children.
More than 300 of them are orphans because HIV has taken their parents away.
In Esitjeni, we can observe on a smaller scale the evils that overwhelm Swaziland: the highest rate of HIV infection and the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
The population almost never accepts male circumcision, a measure that nevertheless guarantees a proven reduction in the risk of infection by half.
More than 40% of Swaziland's population carries the immunodeficiency virus and it is not uncommon to die in your mid-thirties.
During a group trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir had been able to discover the village. The Imbongis especially saw many children in the street who lacked not only parental care, but also simply everything: food, clothing, education.
In a poor country without a school diploma, there is simply no prospect.
In the beginning, it was just a few people who personally committed to pay a few euros each year so that they could send a child to school and offer him a hot meal a day.
But just a year later, the choir founded "Voices for Africa", an association that since then has dealt almost professionally with AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about Sexually Transmitted Infections
What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea.
Common STIs are HIV, human papillomavirus, genital herpes, or hepatitis.
Pubic lice and scabies belong to parasitic STIs.
What are the main groups concerned?
Syphilis and gonorrhoea often appear in men who have sex with other men.
The Robert Koch Institute estimates that sexual contact between men is the cause of at least four out of every five cases of syphilis reported in Germany.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydial-related infections, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungal), gonorrhea, and human papillomavirus are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The rate of spread of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany; however, some 20% of new HIV infections occur in this group.
A significantly higher rate of chlamydial-related infections is observed in young people than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections are among young people aged 15 to 25.
In addition, in Germany, the human papilloma virus is common in young people.
What is the evolution of the number of infections?
It is not mandatory to report all sexually transmitted diseases.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis cases has more than doubled in 10 years, from 1,967 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections has been declining.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
This represents a decrease of one tenth compared to the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a sexual illness?
Infectious diseases can cause abscesses in the genitals, urinary pain, white discharge, pain in the lower abdomen as well as the appearance of pimples and warts.
However, they do not regularly cause any pain or other symptoms and therefore remain hidden.
How to protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not protect 100%.
The reason for this is that pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through lubricating infection or through close body contact.
Experts therefore recommend that anyone who often changes sexual partners should have regular check-ups.
Most rapidly detected STIs can be cured and late sequelae can be avoided.
Thanks to sponsorships, donations, but above all to the funds raised by the singers thanks to their voices throughout Germany, the means are accumulating.
"In all, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esijeni," says Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a confident woman who always gets what she wants, manages the money from Germany.
She also ensures that orphans are well housed, for example in one of their grandmothers.
The gogos, as the old women are called in Zulu, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them accommodate up to 14 orphans, provide them with a roof over their heads and ensure that they go to school on time every day in their uniforms.
The orphan who no longer has anyone is welcomed in a safe place, at Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, just like the two cooks who prepare meals every day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" created a sewing school and allowed the construction of two chicken coops. With the help of the American health organization PSI, the association organized an HIV test for many inhabitants.
This is not obvious, because although the disease is clearly visible throughout the country, it remains a taboo subject.
A King and His 14 Wives
"AIDS is a real taboo," explains Annette Lennartz, "because it is a topic that affects sexuality."
This is quite curious, coming from a country whose king has 14 official wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy in place of democracy.
These state-sanctioned mores, among others, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV observed in recent decades.
Migrant workers have also spread the virus across the country.
Condoms are found on every street corner, Annette Lennartz adds, “but almost no one uses them.
The culture is different, flesh against flesh.”
In order to encourage some cultural exchange, the singers of Imbongi travel together every two or three years to the South of Africa and sing songs full of nostalgia, courage, confidence and black identity that many inhabitants of the tip of the black continent still know from the time of apartheid.
The bus full of whites singing in the African language is a sign of recognition such that it generates not only good mood and joy, but sometimes also tears a tear at some fearsome border guards.
The bus still takes them to Esitjeni, where the choristers visit their godchildren.
Although it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitjeni is well known in the Ezulweni Valley.
"Go to Esitjeni, you will find light there," say the people there.
And after a 8.733-kilometre journey as a bird, back to Heidelberg, in front of those choristers kicking their feet in the rehearsal room of Bergheimer Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e, there is also light.
Messenger: NASA discovers the presence of ice on Mercury
The Messenger spacecraft has reported evidence of ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice sheet could be up to 20 meters thick.
The US space agency NASA has proved the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although this planet is the closest to the Sun, it contains frozen water, as explained by three studies published this Thursday in the specialized journal "Science".
The Messenger spacecraft has reported evidence of ice cover in the region of the planet permanently shrouded in shadow.
This cover would have a thickness of at least 30 centimeters up to 20 meters.
The water probably comes from comets or perhaps asteroids that would have hit Mercury.
However, no one has made a link between the discovery of water and the hypothesis of a presence of life on the planet, explains the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
The discovery could help understand how water and other life-sustaining elements arrived in other parts of the solar system.
Undetected by the inhabitants of our planet, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to the earth, like small interstices through which one observes infinity.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not considered a "planet," according to the International Astronomical Union's new 2006 definition of the term.
This detail from an infrared photograph taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a “family portrait” of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are in blue and the pink dots, more difficult to identify, are the “newborns” in the universe’s birthing room.
The Spitzer telescope has discovered this region where the stars are born, called "W5", a very unromantic name, in the constellation Cassiopeia, 6,500 light-years away.
NASA's Spitzer Telescope has photographed the blazing glow of a dying star.
The doughnut-shaped circle is made up of elements that the star projects when it dies.
In the immense Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, gas and dust form new stars.
The Spitzer telescope photographed this galactic delivery room.
The Pleiades, star clusters also called "the seven sisters", can be observed with the naked eye at night.
However, the telescope puts more emphasis on colors.
In this infrared photo, the Helice Nebula, like a red eye, looks directly at the viewer.
It is located 700 light-years away in the constellation Aquarius.
Its resemblance to a terrestrial continent earned it the title of North America.
The combination of normal and infrared photography makes it possible to observe a spectacular hue.
Only the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope were able to capture an image of the new star in all its beauty.
One of the greatest puzzles in astronomy is the creation of Saturn's rings.
One theory is that the rings are the remains of a moon of Saturn that disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without a trace.
One of the largest and sharpest images ever taken by the Hubble Space Telescope is of the Swirl Galaxy.
Depending on the hue, photographs of spiral galaxies can become real works of art.
The photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula in the constellation Sagittarius, several thousand light-years away.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided, divided into three), because three trails of dust divide the glowing heart from the birthplace of the stars.
Astronomers have photographed the beginnings of a cosmic carambola in the constellation of the Snake: 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two merging galaxies rush towards each other, the collision is inevitable.
The Hubble telescope observed the birth of these stars in the spiral galaxy M83.
If you do not like technical abbreviations, you can use its nickname "southern wheel of fire".
The Hubble Space Telescope image shows a detail of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
The nebula lies 1,400 light-years away and is composed of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times smaller than ordinary household dust.
This photo was developed from optical and radiographic images taken by different telescopes.
The black hole circle is 430 million light-years from Earth.
The space telescope photographed for NASA this group of galaxies called Arp 273.
Scientists have named the largest spiral galaxy "GC 1810".
In this nebula lies the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The celestial cradle always gives birth to new stars.
These star clouds, which are connected by the Rosette Nebula, also permanently create young stars 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this galaxy with luminous rays and pierced by a small black hole, there is no dust yet, there is only gas.
Scientists believe it was born shortly after the big bang, when the universe was largely composed of hydrogen.
Our view of the universe: the main telescopes
The telescope was invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have continued to grow and thanks to them, it has been possible to see further and further into the universe.
For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Hale Telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror in this image had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, in the United States, is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows you to observe the universe through two mirrors each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The belly of the Gran Telescopio Canarias in La Palma, in the Canary Islands, is huge; the mirror itself reaches a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa has been segmented to save money.
The diameter is about 11 meters.
The disadvantage of the economical construction method is that the telescope is fixed at the vertical angle, which limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at the vertical angle.
Its particularity is due to its great ability to collect light.
Despite a relatively small mirror diameter, this capacity is close to that of the world’s largest mirror telescopes.
Scientists are listening to the universe for extra-terrestrial signals using the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico.
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Anyone who owns a computer can help "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI, or "search for extraterrestrial intelligence") by harnessing the computing power of their machine.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope, an installation worthy of its name.
Thanks to a total of four mirrors, this telescope can illuminate the mid-infrared spectrum.
The construction of a very large European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned for the ESO site in Chile.
Its main mirror is expected to reach the impressive size of 42 meters. It will consist of nearly 1,000 mirror elements.
However, the telescope will not be able to take pictures until 2018 at the earliest.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They had two mirrors with a diameter of 10 meters each.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which observes the sky with the Subaru Telescope and the IRTF.
A new gigantic telescope is also expected to be built on Mauna Kea and the diameter of its mirror will reach 30 meters.
This illustration makes it possible to admire it.
However, the most important images of space come from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has been giving us images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope has been searching for exoplanets, essentially those that are habitable.
NASA announced on February 2, 2011 that it had found 1,235 candidate planets since the start of the mission.
This photo illustrates the final preparations before the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The James-Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent into space at the earliest in 2018 aboard an Ariane 5 rocket.
The first mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
The mission of the telescope will be to find light projected by the first stars and galaxies after the big bang.
Scientists believe that Mercury’s south pole is also home to ice.
However, no reliable data on this theory exists, as Messenger orbits much closer to Mercury's North Pole.
Radar data have indicated the presence of ice on Mercury for decades.
Thanks to the launch of the Messenger probe in 2004, the first to orbit Mercury, scientists are now certain.
Drink butter daily, and live up to 168 years
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a Museum of Longevity.
A survey of a country, in which one is still relatively young at 97 years old.
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a Museum of Longevity.
A survey of a country, in which one is still relatively young at 97 years old.
The journey to the Talysh Mountains is one of unbridled romanticism.
Around the many turns of the road, the small bus bumps along wooded hills, torrential rivers and modest farms.
Everything is green and fertile, it almost looks like the Black Forest.
But we are here in the deep south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
This is where the Caucasian ethnic group by the name of Talysh lives, about whom little is known except that they speak Persian and Azeri perfectly and have a very long life span.
Terminus: Lerik.
The small town smacks of its overly aggressive Soviet-era architecture that doesn’t match the picturesque mountain landscape at all.
European tourists are rare here, the journey from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is far too painful.
It takes eight hours to travel the 323 kilometers, because the road has only one lane.
The province has yet to take advantage of the legendary wealth the country owes to its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.
However, 48-year-old Pilata Fatulayeva is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist spot.
"Bakou became famous in May thanks to the Eurovision Song Contest, and next year there will be here the festival of the oldest people in the world," Fatulayeva explains.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, the only museum of its kind in the world.
We can discover the life of about eight dozen Talysh of the region who are more than 100 years old. Fatulayeva shows us a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he's 120 years old.
Have another child at 136 years old
But the controversial star of the museum is <0xC5><0x9E>irali M<0xC3><0xBC>sl<0xC3><0xBC>mov, a shepherd who would have been 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And when one thinks that the oldest documented person was 122 years old, M<0xC3><0xBC>sl<0xC3><0xBC>mov’s age seems more than doubtful.
"He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973," Fatulayeva said.
The man is said to have married three times and had 23 children, and at the age of 136, he would still have conceived a daughter.
Would <0xC5><0x9E>irali M<0xC3><0xBC>sl<0xC3><0xBC>mov have been wrong for a few decades in calculating his age?
Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard him talk about the great age of Central Asia.
“Surprisingly old people also live in parts of China, in Japan or in Pakistan’s Hunza Valley,” Scholz explains, “in Sardinia too, there are men who live incredibly old.”
However, it is impossible to establish scientific evidence due to the non-existence of documents, not to mention that there was no civil registry.
Every day, a glass of melted butter
It is nevertheless a fact that the people of the Lerik region often reach an age worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
Currently, 20 people are over 100 years old.
So what is the reason for the longevity in the South of this country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, the Azeri tourist guide, explains that the Talysh have particular genes.
On the other hand, Fatulayeva, the director of the museum, thinks that it is a matter of food.
However, it does not seem plausible, from a nutritional point of view, that the high-calorie meals of the Talysh, who love meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of whom drink a glass of melted butter daily, are good for their health.
In Cengemiran, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva lives a simple life that preserves the youth of the people.
At 97 years old, she is still relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wooden house, as is typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor next to a baratte, whose contents she beats tirelessly.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva’s sons and a daughter, who have long been adults.
Two small children also frolic in the house.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests served in typical belly-shaped armed glasses.
Mirzayeva's white teeth are perfectly aligned, and under her scarf hide long braids of a dark blonde that her son reveals to us with pride.
I have always washed my hair with milk, and this is how I never lost them and they kept their color.
“I’ve never used shampoo,” Mirzayeva adds.
Monthly retirement is enough to live on.
She has always eaten what comes from her own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
In all my life, I have never bought any food at a supermarket.
Then she tells us about her husband who was in the army.
The worst moments were after the Second World War.
But everything improved when the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took over.
The language of propaganda amazes in the mouth of an old lady.
However, the cult of the father figure of the nation, a man who nevertheless ruled his country as a dictator, knows almost no limits in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, when his son Ilham succeeded him.
In any case, elderly people in Azerbaijan do not experience distress.
Mirzayeva receives monthly 230 manats (about the same amount as in euros) for her retirement, a sum that guarantees a good lifestyle in the region.
And perhaps Mirzayeva’s long-greyed son is right: “the elders enjoy great respect in our culture.”
They are the center of the big family, they are loved, cared for and happy.
This is a good reason to live as long as possible.
The "Rights of Man" Omitted in the Constitution
The revolution is reborn in Cairo.
Rival demonstrations reveal the deep fracture of the country.
The draft Sharia-based constitution is fiercely controversial.
The Egyptian president is not stingy with words full of emotions.
We must succeed in the transition.
“And this success is my responsibility to the people and to God,” he said on state television.
His speech was intended for the entire people, but also especially for Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims and lay people.
Because all members of the confused and hopelessly disunited opposition are afraid.
They are afraid of a theocracy on the Nile in the hands of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohamed Morsi said, almost apologizing, that he had temporarily restricted the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded its powers “in order to save the revolution.”
However, Egyptians and the world do not really know what this 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate from the American University of Southern California, wants to save.
Will the judiciary be overthrown?
The 234 hastily drafted articles by the predominantly Islamic 100-strong Constituent Assembly during a 15-hour nightly tour of force are indeed worrisome to some extent.
As in previous constitutions, the draft provides for case law to be based on "the principles of Islamic law".
What does the word “principles” really mean?
This was and still is a question of interpretation, and there is good reason to fear that Islamists will use the vague wording and the resulting legal leeway to enforce a stricter interpretation of Sharia law.
In any case, this suggests a newly introduced article stating that, with regard to all subjects related to Sharia, al-Azhar University should be consulted. The establishment is the most important Islamic institution in the country and its brilliance radiates throughout the Sunni Islamic world.
This may, but does not necessarily mean that the clergy will supervise the legislative apparatus, which would result in the de facto placing of the judicial power under guardianship.
Many points of the draft Constitution are subject to interpretation.
Another problematic aspect is the likely maintenance of military jurisdiction.
During Mubarak's reign, these courts worked to suppress opponents.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were detained by the military.
The government must also protect “the true nature of the Egyptian family” and “promote its morals and values.”
From a legal point of view, the formulation is so vague that state institutions could even control the content of cinematographic art and literature.
In other words, it would simply be censorship.
Moreover, there is no explicit guarantee of equality between men and women in any of the articles.
Instead, another article forbids offending or defaming the Prophet Muhammad or his envoys.
However, the article does not define what an offence is or how it should be punished.
Equally dubious is the wording suggesting that it is forbidden to "offend people".
Is it enough to draw a caricature of the president or tell a joke at the expense of a lawman?
Many points are therefore subject to interpretation in the draft that Morsi submits to the vote and which, in his own words, will "very soon" be the subject of a referendum with the Egyptians.
"The revolution is reborn"
The opposition has been mobilizing for weeks against the numerical superiority of the Islamists.
On Friday evening, tens of thousands of demonstrators rallied in an unusual concord in Cairo’s Tahrir Square, vowing to bring down Sharia law before it takes effect.
"The revolution is reborn and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, who came third in the presidential election.
Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El Baradei said the draft constitution is “to be thrown into the dustbin of history”.
On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused Morsi supporters of wanting to foment a “putsch against democracy.”
"If he proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," said Jasser Said, an opponent.
“We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet expiated,” said Khaled Ali, a politician and member of the opposition, according to Egyptian media.
In addition, several judges announced that they did not want to monitor the referendum, which would result in its nullity.
"The Qur'an is our Constitution"
For its part, the Muslim Brotherhood, well organized, called for a counter-demonstration not in Tahrir Square as a precautionary measure, but on the other bank of the Nile, where a large prayer was organized in front of Cairo University.
The veiled women and supporters of the Salafists, who participated in large numbers, chanted: "The people demand the application of the law of God."
“Cleanse our country!” they asked Morsi, claiming that “the Koran [was their] Constitution.”
A struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic Tharir Square, where it all began, would soon have generated a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Clearly, this is what Morsi’s supporters wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brotherhood said opponents of the draft constitution, along with its supporters, had spoken out loudly.
According to them, it is now time to let the people decide by the ballot box which direction the country should take.
The Islamists’ project will certainly win the majority.
"Human rights are not mentioned only once"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry at this imposed constitutional process which should have lasted until February and encompassed all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) had defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or in court under Mubarak.
He did so not because he shared their worldview, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
This is why he was beaten, tried and imprisoned.
"And now the term is not even pronounced once in the new constitution," he said in an interview with the Welt am Sonntag newspaper.
The extension of Morsi’s powers to the three powers discouraged the lawyer.
These measures are blatant violations of the rules of democracy and will lead to a new dictatorship in Egypt.
“Instead of strengthening civil society, the president is de facto stripping it of all its powers,” Saeda said.
Yet a democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels neglected, including by the international community, which looks at the battle between different political ideologies on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.
It could pay off.
A protester in Tharir Square warns: "you are giving birth to a monster that you will no longer be able to control."
Norway’s rakfisk: is it the most fragrant fish in the world?
The five million people who live in Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe, but also in the world.
Could the secret to the country’s success be linked to the locals’ appetite for an extremely fragrant fish?
Take advanced cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of wet and dirty soccer clothes.
Wait a week.
And you get the disturbing smell of rakfisk, one of Norway's most popular dishes.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about 3 hours from Oslo.
It snows, the scenery is spectacular - and this smell, omnipresent, permeates the air.
The rakfisk consists of trout sprinkled with salt and fermented in water for a duration - depending on the smell you want it to exhale - which can go up to a year.
When darkness sets in and it gets cold, Norwegians gather en masse to attend a festival here in Fagernes dedicated to this incredible culinary speciality.
“You eat raw, then you swallow a glass of aquavit,” says Havard Halvarsen, a full-time local firefighter who is also known as “Rakfisk General,” who is in charge of managing the festival.
Around us, people swallow small pieces of fish and put on a large amount of drink.
“Some people prefer aquavit to rakfisk,” adds Havard.
The drink kills the smell.
I'm trying out a few pieces.
If you can avoid putting it under your nose, it’s not bad – it’s reminiscent of a sushi that would have spent long hours on a bus.
The rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of refrigeration, the fish was immersed in airtight water barrels, then salted in autumn.
Then, during the winter, once well fermented, the fish came out and - undoubtedly with the senses impaired by alcohol - ate.
In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to find work, emigrating mainly to the United States.
Now, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by full employment, high wages and a comprehensive health system.
The Swedes, their old rivals whose country was not so long ago richer than Norway, cross the border to come to work.
The rakfisk is considered something important, a vital, though odorous, element of Norway's past.
This is one of the most expensive dishes.
But everything is expensive - a small pint of beer or a sandwich will cost you 10 € each.
Norway does not often make headlines in international news, which is not to its displeasure.
Here, people are not willing to talk about Anders Breivik, the right-wing extremist racist who shot dead 77 people, including women and children.
When they talk about this killing, they talk about the "July 22 incident".
The Norwegians find it difficult to accept that in their peaceful country, one of their own might have committed such an act of barbarism.
Since the early 1970s, Norway owes its wealth to its oil and gas industry, one of the largest in the world.
“But oil is not the only reason that justifies our success,” explains Anna, our waitress, with blonde hair and piercing blue eyes, the image of Nordic well-being, with a tray of rakfisk in her hand.
We are – as you say – cautious people.
Her English, like most of the people who live here, is perfect.
We are discreet, we do not like to be noticed.
Norway has managed its oil wealth very cautiously - everything, except a small percentage of money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When other countries were throwing money out the window in the years leading up to the international financial crisis, Norway was able to keep its purse strings tight.
“As long as you can ski in the winter and hike in the summer, we’re happy,” says Anna.
“Not to mention the rakfisk,” she adds in a carefree laugh.
I stand in the snow and stand in line to buy something to eat - I got my dose of rakfisk.
On the menu, a burger made of moose, a real discovery, it is excellent.
But tonight, the smell of fish is everywhere.
The hotel I am staying in is one of the many places where rakfisk is served for dinner and where you can vote for the best of them - or perhaps the most fragrant of them.
There is a TV show where the presenter wears a bow tie, surrounded by rakfisk plates.
It looks like the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score did you give the best fish in the Thor-Juergen Mountains?"
"Here's our points, Havard."
We hear laughter and applause.
A man falls out of his chair, perhaps because of the abuse of aquavit.
Or maybe it's because of the fish fumes.
Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto has a tough start.
As incoming President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office in Mexico, Will Grant, of the BBC, takes an interest in the difficulties that await him and the expectations of the people, which are numerous.
Traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad at the moment.
In a city where traffic jams are common, a security barrier has been in place since Monday, blocking several key road accesses to the capital and causing real chaos on the roads.
Nevertheless, the aim was not to prevent people from going to their work, but to prevent protesters from reaching Parliament.
Next Saturday, Mexico’s new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential sash to become the nation’s new president.
A complicated task awaits him.
Mexico's economy is doing well, a result that is owed to outgoing President Felipe Calderon, but the country is in the throes of a drug war that has already claimed the lives of about 60,000 people in six years.
“My government has made a commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence,” Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before he met the US president, Pena Nieto was governor of Mexico.
A very populous and sprawling state that surrounds the capital. On his preferred land, opinions about this new leader are divided.
A direct man
In the bucolic town of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is inscribed in the memory of all.
The locals attribute it to the development of tourism and infrastructure in the municipality.
To reach the city, you can take one of the new highways of M Pena Nieto, a significant improvement has been made to these roads, once bumpy and full of crevasses.
Plaques bearing his name are hung outside a new sports complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
“We are counting on him to bring about lasting change,” said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a congressman and member of Pena Nieto’s party, the PRI.
In terms of security and economy, in particular, we hope for a real change that our country needs so much.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years spent outside the presidential palace in Los Pinos, there are high expectations within the party regarding Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejects criticism from opponents who accuse the new president of lacking charisma.
He's a whole man, very committed, with an excellent vision of the country.
He is an excellent statesman and, above all, he knows how to listen.
However, this is not always the image that people have of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more glaring.
Hidden under motorway bridges, it is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City.
And the problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban.
Earlier this year, members of the military were called to the rescue to fight drug gangs in neighbourhoods, where violence against women is particularly serious.
In a disaster area, the bodies of dozens of women murdered in the last two years were found on the edge of the landfill.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Pena Nieto was governor, a far higher rate than in the very violent city of Ciudad Juarez — a place infamous for the number of innocent women killed there.
Mr Pena Nieto's critics say that at best he has failed to curb the problem of murders committed against women when he was in office.
At worst, they accuse his administration of refusing to face reality.
In a concrete house, typical of this dilapidated neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles to hold back her tears when she shows me photos of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official version mentions a suicide committed by Mariana in 2010.
However, her family believes she was killed by her partner.
“When I arrived at her house, it seemed to me that her body had been washed,” says Se<0xC3><0xB1>ora Buendia.
Signs indicated that she had been beaten, and cadaveric rigidity had already begun.
While her mother tells the story, a photo of Mariana dresses the wall, next to a cross where the word: Justice.
However, this is exactly what the family was denied.
The authorities treated me like I was an old gossip, a troublemaker, a whiner.
They want us to accept what they say and shut up.
“But it’s not normal that there are so many irregularities and omissions,” she said.
When President Pena Nieto receives her scarf on Saturday, she will carry a heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by crime in Mexico over the past six years, and the new president has vowed to make it his priority during his tenure.
“I hope he will be as good as he was as a governor,” Olvera told Valle del Bravo, a member of Congress.
However, this is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear the most.
Bradley Manning has not complained of ill-treatment, prosecutors say.
Prosecutors are trying to counter claims of ill-treatment that Bradley Manning was allegedly subjected to while in detention.
The trial concerns Manning’s detention in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants to close the case on the grounds that Manning's abduction took place under extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors tried to show on Friday that Private Bradley Manning -- accused of causing the largest leak of confidential information in the history of the U.S. military -- has missed many opportunities to complain about the ill-treatment he claims to have suffered during his military detention.
In a cross-examination with Manning, during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Attorney Maj. Ashden Fein claimed that recordings of weekly visits to Manning by officers during his nine-month detention in Quantico, Virginia, revealed no complaints about his treatment.
The cross-examination -- during a hearing, the defence filed a motion demanding that the Manning case be dismissed on the grounds that the seizure was carried out under very difficult conditions and constituted a sufficiently severe punishment -- took place one day after Manning testified that he wanted to commit suicide while in detention.
This military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of having stolen thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The documents were later published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was their source.
At Friday’s hearing, Fein and Manning reviewed the forms officers had filled out after meeting Manning during his detention in Quantico Military Prison, where he was subjected to maximum solitary confinement from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein mentioned the forms on Friday, Manning acknowledged that the treatment he received from his guards was "excellent" and that the treatment he had received in prison was overall "very professional."
The forms do not report any complaints of ill-treatment, although officers directly questioned him about his prison treatment, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed concerns about certain issues orally and that the visiting officers had discussed his concerns and indicated that they would deal with them, but they did not record the issues raised.
"They wrote 'no problems' (after addressing the concerns), and yet that didn't mean I didn't raise any problems," Manning said.
Military Judge Col. Denise Lind also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment during an interview in January 2011 with the special commission that had met to discuss the suicidal thoughts he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning responded that his intention during the meeting was to have his restrictive status changed indicating a “risk of injury.”
The military said it assigned him this restrictive status -- one level below close surveillance for suicide risk -- for his protection and the safety of others.
“I wanted the staff to know that I was doing well, and I wanted to be removed from that status ... in order to benefit from a better quality of life from my point of view,” Manning said.
Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison at the Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he considered suicide when he was in Kuwait and fainted once because of the heat.
He added that not being kept informed of what was going to happen to him or what was happening in the rest of the world was very distressing.
“My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, to this cage,” Manning said Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in that cage.
Once in Quantico, Manning said he spent most of his time in a small cell — at least 9 p.m. and sometimes more than 11 p.m. — without company.
Manning also added that the only items he had were a mattress, blanket, flip-flops, clothes and his glasses.
He tried to stay on the move because sleeping or lying down during the day was against the rules.
Manning also said that when he was trying to sleep, he had a light in his eyes, which was turned on outside his cell.
If the guards did not see his face when he turned at night, they would wake him up so they could see his face.
Manning’s lawyer filed a formal complaint for Manning’s treatment in January 2011.
Manning was placed in a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
Also Friday, the judge asked Manning questions about an allegation reported in his testimony Thursday -- that after being forced to sleep naked all night in his cell in Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of guards and other inmates one morning during the appeal.
Manning testified that at no time was she allowed to cover herself with a blanket during the call.
During the judge’s questions Friday, Manning said he inferred from his guard’s order that he had to let go of his cover that might have hidden his nudity, but he acknowledged that no one had ordered him to let go.
Manning testified Thursday that he was forced to sleep naked the night before because he allegedly tried to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning reportedly told the officer that he could have used the elastic in his briefs or flip-flops to injure himself, but that he did not.
That night, Manning testified that his underwear, flip-flops, and glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take into account the experiences he has experienced during his detention and that he will significantly reduce his sentence if he were to be convicted in a court martial, a trial that is expected to take place early next year.
The defense said Manning plans to plead guilty to the least serious offenses and fight for the dropping of other charges deemed too extreme.
The hearing is expected to resume this weekend, with prosecutors expected to argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has confirmed that Manning was incarcerated in accordance with regulations governing the conditions of detention of all detainees at Quantico.
Charges against Manning include theft of public property or documents, collusion with the enemy, the illegal publication of information on the Internet, and the transmission of information relating to national defense.
If all the charges are upheld, he faces life imprisonment.
The Mexican-American Identity Crisis
He says many have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame those who left; they remind Mexicans of difficult times, he said.
Navarrette says Mexican-Americans find themselves caught between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, arriving in the lobby, in front of customs and immigration services, I felt lost.
Signs indicated two routes: one for the "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), another for the "Extranjeros" ("Foreigners").
I stood motionless for several seconds, not knowing which line to turn to.
I grew up in central California, where I’ve been called the “Mexican” all my life.
It’s an ethnic qualifier, just like the one my friends in Boston use when they call themselves “Irish,” or my friends in New York when they call themselves “Italian.”
Then I became a Mexican-American.
But, here, it was Mexico.
And in the land where my grandfather was born, there is no need for a special qualifier or a hyphen.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to handle an interview in either language.
But I don't have the vocabulary of an Aboriginal, and I can't lose my American accent.
So I took my American passport and headed for the "Foreigners" line.
I thought back to that time of the week when Mexico’s new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, visited President Obama at the White House.
Generally, when the leaders of these two countries meet, their favorite themes are immigration, drugs, and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans stay in Mexico rather than risk themselves in the United States.
He wants to ally with the United States and Canada, and create a Union for Trade on the model of the European Union, but in North America.
And Pena Nieto pledges to continue the war on drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not provide more details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and bitter.
Most Americans have probably never thought about the fact that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to cede half of their territory in writing at gunpoint.
But for Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, and no minutes, memories are everywhere.
Therefore, as soon as a U.S. official makes the slightest criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear -- in the Mexican press, and among the elites -- complaints about how the Americans are undermining the sovereignty of their neighbor.
And Montezuma's kids are looking for a fight.
And yet, for Mexico, the most difficult relationship is the one that the country has with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans who live in the United States.
Do you want to talk about bitterness?
There's a lot of them.
Mexico has its winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom the country does not.
The only reason that explains the large number of Mexican ancestors in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at some point, in our family tree, a person, perhaps a relative or a grandparent, did not find any opportunity in Mexico and had to go to the North.
And more often than not, that person matched a typical profile -- dark skin, poorly educated, from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even if we are currently living the American dream, that we have gone to good schools and that we have good situations, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream that we are living, and not that of the Mexicans.
Our identity is sometimes troubled, but our loyalty is obvious.
We grant it to the United States.
On the other hand, we know that part of the Mexican elite among the ruling class does not like us.
The feeling is mutual.
We remind them of a humiliating defeat and they tell us as if we were individuals of inferior stock and not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
For them, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families had not failed when they lived in Mexico, they would never have left.
And we would not find ourselves stuck on the right side of the fence, living comfortably in the United States, but as lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally immigrated to the United States as a child, reminds me that there is friction between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans, as Mexicans more firmly claim their identity and Mexican-Americans are annoyed by it.
Although she is an American citizen, she feels like she is part of two countries.
On the other hand, many Mexican-Americans I know do not feel like they are part of one country or the other.
We love the music of the Mexican band, Los Tigres del Norte, but also that of Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of both worlds, but we are not rooted in either.
In Mexico, we are considered Americans.
And in the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
And now, to complicate the relationship a little more, as I learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and a part of the intelligentsia want to get closer to the Diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as ambassadors of fortune for Mexico, representing its interests in the United States.
We will have to explain to our American compatriots that Mexico is a beautiful country that must be visited and put pressure on political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
That's not gonna happen.
There's too much bitterness.
And when you consider the pervasive wage inequality, corruption and drug-related violence, many of us are not convinced that this is a fantastic country.
You're gonna have to fend for yourself, amigos.
It's normal.
If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, they must therefore accept that some Mexican-Americans still resent them for the way their family members were treated not so long ago.
Mm-hmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexican" than I thought.
Old quarrels, new Middle East
The cease-fire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace.
Will there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed seems to indicate that such a hope is futile.
While the same futile arguments persist as to who started it, dozens of buildings have been reduced to dust; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed; and, for the first time, rockets fired from Gaza have landed near Tel Aviv, Israel’s metropolis, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although the Israelis and Palestinians seem stuck in their old conflict, all around them, the Middle East is in flux.
The Arab Spring has shattered everything, and whether we like it or not, the Palestinians and Israelis are caught up in this regional upheaval.
Perhaps their struggle will intensify even more.
Yet there is every reason to think it could help them get out of this deadly impasse.
A war that makes no losers and no winners
At first glance, it seems difficult to be optimistic.
Even as the Nov. 21 ceasefire holds, this week’s fighting has bolstered supporters of the force on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will boast that they forced the Israelis to give up, even though Gaza was badly beaten.
Having killed some of its leaders and driven the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza into one of the most miserable and overcrowded corners of the planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently in the hands of their rivals Fatah, the other more moderate Palestinian faction.
Moreover, Hamas leaders might think that time is their ally.
The influence of Islamists in the Arab world is growing, and Hamas has made rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a burgeoning regional power, once Israel’s closest Muslim ally, has made a case for Hamas; as has Qatar, one of the Gulf’s wealthiest and most dynamic states.
Hamas members are jubilant and say the Islamist crescent is curving around Israel, from Lebanon in the north, where Hezbollah’s militia exercises dominance, through Syria, where Islamist-leaning rebels can topple Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And most importantly, on Israel’s southern flank, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the presidency of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and central of Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas.
The Muslim Brotherhood, on the other hand, are cousins of Hamas, and its leaders are more easily swayed by public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas can emerge as an important actor that can no longer be excluded even by Israel and America.
Meanwhile, Israel’s hardliners will draw the opposite conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas has been boxed in.
The Iron Dome missile interception system has proven its effectiveness and many Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will be able to sleep on both their ears - for a while.
In terms of diplomacy, America is renewing its unwavering support; and many European countries have blamed Hamas for being behind the latest wave of violence.
But above all, Israel prospered, especially under Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, who totally ignored the peace process.
Although rocket fire from Gaza has killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been spared suicide bombings, thanks in part to the separation barrier that encroaches on the West Bank, the main piece of what could be a Palestinian state, and which protects Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite their illegality under international law.
Netanyahu, whose Likud party has merged with an even more hawkish party, that of leader Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to the Jan. 22 election, has the bright side.
Why pamper these fucking Palestinians by giving them a state?
If they ruled the West Bank, would they not launch rockets, as their compatriots did in Gaza?
It’s best to keep them behind that wall and hit them as soon as they get their head out.
Perhaps the hardliners will win; but the Arab Spring may be a game-changer.
Even if the Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere dislike Israel, their priority will be to tackle the problems in their own countries.
Israel’s defense budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors combined.
Starting a war with the local superpower will not help the new Arab governments to arrange their economies.
Morsi worked with Barack Obama to secure a ceasefire, which bodes well -- and could mark the beginning of something.
Israelis should also think about the future.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a powder keg that is destined to explode one day in Israeli-occupied territories – much like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression is already weakening democracy in the Jewish state, and demographics are exacerbating this problem as the Arab population increases.
Bloody missions to Gaza every two or three years to sound Hamas will have a diplomatic price.
Both sides need to be pushed by those on the outside.
The answer remains the one advocated by the reasonable people on either side, and by most of the outside world, and by this paper: two states, with Israel ceding territory in exchange for security.
One hope, small and short-term, is that the ceasefire will provide an opportunity for outsiders to champion this cause.
Egypt, which must now work to end the flow of arms to Gaza, as well as Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in accordance with the 1967 borders with land swaps and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs from outside should also pressure Hamas and Fatah to unite.
This would contribute much more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the forthcoming proposal of a pseudo-state at the UN.
Mr. Obama also has a vested interest in Israel agreeing to negotiate.
During his first term, he did not present his own peace plan.
Back in the White House, he seems just as reluctant to establish one.
It's a very narrow view.
The stability of the Middle East is a vital issue for America.
This requires a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Laws for neutral cigarette packs come into force in Australia
Warnings and pictures of diseased organs cover the dark green packets which are all identical, regardless of brand
The law, which came into force in Australia, is a world first, the logos and colours have been replaced by a dark olive green and horrible pictures of sick organs and depictions of children and babies whose illnesses were caused by their parents’ smoking.
Apart from the different photos and health warnings, the only difference between the packages, since this Saturday, is the name of the brand, printed in small print on all the packages.
This is the strictest tobacco packaging regime in the world.
The Australian federal government said the goal was to dissuade young people from smoking by removing any glamorous depictions.
Studies have shown that if people did not start smoking before the age of 26, there is a 99% chance that they will never start.
“Even when they are very young, children understand the message conveyed by tobacco manufacturers through their brand image,” said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that revealed, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with a princess.
Although Australia has the lowest smoking rate in the world and these changes have little impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries are considering a similar approach.
The tobacco industry has lobbied against this legislation.
Tobacco manufacturers have said it will boost black market trade, which will make it easier to access cheaper cigarettes.
“Harmful consequences will result from this legislation,” said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Counterfeiters in China and Indonesia will sell far more counterfeit cigarettes on the streets of Australia.
Others said that this law had boosted their activity.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family-owned company, said demand for cigarette cases, including silicone to mask horrible packaging, has sharply increased two months ago since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco challenged the law and lost in Australia's high court.
Ha said Zico has sold 6,000 of them to wholesalers and is awaiting stock renewal.
For us, business is good.
The only problem, experts say, is the popularity of social media and the size of the population targeted by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws banning TV advertising, sports sponsorship and requiring retailers to hide cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online.
Australia has banned web advertising by local businesses and sites, but it cannot prevent foreign sites from doing so.
“If you work in tobacco marketing and only have a small window to promote your products, the internet is the go-to place,” said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noted an increase in contributions from some average citizens in favor of brands on social media like YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook.
We have to ask ourselves if this is a simple citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes and has taken the trouble to make a video, or if it is a marketing campaign orchestrated by an agency?
British American Tobacco Australia said the industry is focusing on the new regulations rather than marketing.
The industry has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge these new court rulings – these countries have told WHO that trade is unfairly disadvantaged, although none of these countries have had significant trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected in the course of 2013.
Plibersek said the government had held discussions with other countries about similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to make packaging warning photos mandatory in 2001.
Now, these warnings are present in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Tougher laws are currently being considered in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photos.
The pictures don't bother me.
I don't know.
"You take a cigarette and you put the package away," Victor El Hage said as he bought a package that included a picture of a tumor in his mouth.
To be honest, the only reason I'm getting arrested is my little girl.
James Yu, manager of the "King of the Pack tobacconist" in central Sydney, said that the uniformity of packaging made it difficult to store packages on the shelves.
“Before, I needed an hour to unload a package, now I need four hours,” Yu said.
"The government just had to ban them once and for all and we would have said OK, that's all right, we stop and put the key under the door," he added, raising his arms to the sky.
In a constantly connected world, it can be good to get bored.
I spent five hours in an airport during the Thanksgiving period because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
Therefore, I had enough time to think about the topic of boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spending half a day at an airport waiting for a flight is pretty boring, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to distract you (not to mention duty-free shops).
But increasingly, some academics and experts specializing in child development are praising boredom.
It’s perfectly normal for us — and our children — to get bored from time to time, they say.
This forces the brain to take interesting paths, even to nurture creativity.
And as we are, for the most part, constantly in front of several types of screens, we no longer know the benefits of boredom.
So should we welcome boredom with open arms?
Oh, yeah.
And no.
But I'll come back.
First of all, like many people, I thought boredom was a fairly recent phenomenon, especially since we have more free time.
But that’s not the case, says Peter Toohey, professor of Greco-Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of “Boredom: A Lively History” (Yale University Press, 2011).
"Boredom goes back a long way," he says.
On the walls of Pompeii there are Latin graffiti that evoke boredom, they date back to the first century.
Then there is the definition we give to boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined, and debated, in different ways, said John D. Eastwood, associate professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After going through numerous publications and submitting the idea to a discussion group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience that consists of "wanting to do something, but failing to get into a satisfying activity."
What differentiates boredom from apathy, he says, is that the person is not undertaking a task even though they would like to.
With apathy, he says, there is no desire to do anything.
What is at the heart of boredom, he said, is “the interruption of the process of attention, associated with a sullen mood and the feeling that time passes slowly.”
Boredom can strongly resemble depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while the two can be linked, bored people tend to think the problem comes from the environment or the world, while depressed people think the problem comes from them.
Sometimes we think we are bored when it is actually a problem of concentration.
As part of their study, “The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention,” which was published in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science in September, Professor Eastwood and colleagues highlighted an older experiment in which participants listened on tape to the voice of a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups heard the loud sound of an unrelated TV show from the next room, others just heard the TV show, and the third group did not hear the soundtrack at all.
Those who heard TV at a low sound level said that they were more bored than the other two groups - they had trouble concentrating, but did not know why, and attributed this concentration problem to boredom.
When you’re trying to focus on a difficult or challenging task, an interruption in attention can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the study’s authors.
On the other hand, when you’re performing a boring task, “like looking at objects on an assembly line, music can help you not to get bored.”
In fact, he says, now we know that when squirming or scribbling, these gestures, often seen as signs of boredom, are actually a good way to stay physically alert.
“Studies have shown that children who are allowed to dodge learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still,” Professor Fenske said.
We all get bored one day or another - the delay of my plane flight, a speaker with a monotone voice, a particularly boring movie.
But some people are more likely to be bored than others.
To measure this, researchers developed a “Boredom Predisposition Scale” in the 1980s.
The scale includes statements such as, "Among the tasks I perform, many of them are repetitive and monotonous," and "I have so many interests that I don't have time to do everything."
Using such a scale, the researchers found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a psychology professor at the University of West Florida, and notably need numerous and varied stimulations.
But in general, teenagers are quickly blasé.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of individual and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day via a beeper.
He noted that 32 percent of teens reported being bored at school and during homework, while 23 percent reported being bored when they were not at school.
In contrast, 3 percent of parents reported being bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether today's percentages of boredom, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he added that he knew that “adolescence is a time when boredom is at its highest,” not least because children and teens don’t have much control over what they want to do.
If I ask you again, is boredom good for you?
Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, this can cause people to take absurd physical risks, make bets or abuse certain substances to pass the time, as studies show.
In contrast, many philosophers and writers evoke a link between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying the problem for more than two decades.
“Boredom is the brain’s way of letting you know that you should be doing something else,” said Gary Marcus, a psychology professor at New York University.
But the brain does not always know what is the most appropriate thing to do.
If you get bored and use that energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term.
So if your child gets bored and you give him an iPad, he won’t get bored anymore, but he won’t have learned to take care of himself or to self-regulate, says Professor Fenske.
And “this self-regulation goes from one situation to another,” he says.
Your child not only learns to be entertained, he gets more control of himself in other areas.
I don't think we should glorify boredom.
Just as I don’t think we should criticize him either.
Feeling comfortable outside the constant bubbling generated by activities and technology is the goal towards which we should aim.
Professor Eastwood agrees on this point.
“We need to get bored more often, but boredom awakens a sharp, frantic desire to be connected to something that makes sense,” he said.
According to him, what people are looking for is a way to disconnect and enjoy downtime.
“In an environment where we’re constantly hyperstimulated,” he added, “it’s hard to find ways to get into something when the noise stops.”
In Colorado, no guidance for new marijuana law
Anthony Orozco, 19, a college student and football player in Colorado, is charged with something that will soon become legal in his state: possession of marijuana pellets and a pipe used to smoke them.
Orozco said that one day in September, he and a few friends were in a car in Lamar, in the middle of the fields near the border with Kansas, when they were arrested.
After the police officer found the marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a subpoena for possession of drugs and equipment that could be used for his consumption — misdemeanors, each accompanied by a $100 fine — and a date for appearance.
“We are treated like criminals,” Orozco said.
But is there one?
In the weeks of uncertainty following Colorado’s vote to legalize the use of small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the answer to hundreds of cases involving low drug use depends more on location than law.
Here and in the state of Washington, which has adopted a similar measure, hundreds of offenses involving the use of marijuana have been classified without follow-up.
Police have stopped charging adults 21 and older with minor possession of marijuana, as the law will take effect in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in Colorado’s more conservative ridings have called for speeding up existing marijuana cases and continue to indict those who possess it.
At the same time, several cities from the Denver suburbs to the western mountains are currently voting to prevent the opening of state-licensed marijuana sales businesses in their neighborhoods.
“Things are changing so quickly that I don’t know what the future holds,” said Daniel J. Oates, the chief of police for Aurora, east of Denver.
Washington state regulators are also asking a lot of questions.
They are seeking guidance on how to install a licensing system, allowing them to produce, manufacture, distribute and sell - before the December 1, 2013 deadline.
They say Colorado, like it or not, is ahead of most states when it comes to marijuana regulations, first regarding use for therapeutic purposes and now regarding personal use.
“Colorado has a more regulated market, and it’s a good indicator,” said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But no place or system, Smith acknowledges, can do more than suggest what works.
“There is no real precedent on which we could base ourselves,” he said.
The Washington law, which is called I-502, takes effect on December 6, leaving a one-year legal loophole, during which the licensing system will still not exist, while possession of marijuana will be legal.
Meanwhile, practical questions remain: how to balance the state’s mandate that guarantees proper access to licensed marijuana and prohibits the installation of cannabis-selling businesses within a 30 km radius around a school, park, playground or cr<0xC3><0xA8>che.
“There will be no more difficult places than urban areas to set up a licensed cannabis business, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area,” said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Cannabis Legalization Center, a recently formed research group.
On Nov. 21, Aurora Police Chief Oates sent an email to his officers announcing that the City Attorney would no longer prosecute people 21 and older who possess small amounts of marijuana, and that police should stop charging people for this type of offense “with immediate effect.”
Chief Oates said police would enforce the new court rulings that regulate the activity of those who grow marijuana for medical purposes, and he would continue to prosecute drug dealers and dealers.
In Weld County, in northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck embodies a stricter vision.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to handle marijuana possession cases, primarily in order to pressure users to get detoxed.
Currently, 119 people are charged with possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of them are facing other charges.
"Our office has an obligation to prosecute those individuals who have committed an offence that, at the material time, was a recognized offence," Buck said.
Reactions have been complicated even in rural places like Mesa County, where voters have rejected the initiative in favor of restricted marijuana use.
Police in Grand Junction, the county's largest city, are no longer bringing in adults for possession of restricted quantities.
The county attorney general’s office, Pete Hautzinger, supported the decision, but also decided not to dismiss all marijuana possession cases.
“I don’t feel like I’m wasting my time continuing to enforce the law until it changes,” he said.
While 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, providing an appropriate legal and governmental framework for personal marijuana use is not easy.
And the contradictory reactions that have been observed in different U.S. cities highlight the profound ambivalence among local officials regarding the legalization of marijuana.
"This is a cultural barrier" with prosecutors, said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents people accused of marijuana use and speaks as a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
“They’ve spent a lot of their lives suing people who used marijuana, so they’re having a hard time accepting that it’s legal,” he said.
As the first states to treat restricted marijuana use at the same level as alcohol, Colorado and Washington state are poised to become a case law for drug legalization.
While advocates and state officials are planning a new legalized sales frontier, they are anxiously awaiting federal government directives, which still conceives marijuana sales and cultivation as federal crimes.
Advocates of marijuana legalization hope the Justice Department will give in.
Despite some high-profile arrests of medical marijuana patients and vendors, the federal government has mostly allowed medical marijuana businesses to operate in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
While it’s true that the police probably aren’t going to break down doors to seize small bags of drugs, it’s a good bet that they’re opposed to licensed businesses selling marijuana for personal use authorized by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former policy adviser to the Obama administration.
Many Colorado cities have not waited for federal authorities to act.
Long before the votes, some local governments approved moratoriums on the creation of new businesses selling marijuana, even if it is only a one-year delay.
Last week, the city of Montrose obtained a 6-month moratorium, and is expected to impose that ban next week.
“We don’t want to end up in a situation where a permit is granted to someone and then find ourselves facing a federal issue,” said Bob Nicholson, a city council member.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are interested in the vote of the community rather than the vote of the state.
A lot of questions arise.
Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied and kicked out of Oxford because I was a Tory.
It’s not just today’s students who are being attacked for their opinions.
For as long as I can remember, I have always dreamed of entering the University of Oxford.
My father and older brother studied in what was for me an eminent place of learning, a kind of modern-day Greek amphitheater that stimulates the two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
Yet two weeks after I settled down at Worcester College in the late 1980s to study history, I decided to pack my bags, causing the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and started to cry.
My friends were baffled.
The Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I left this university because I objected to the fact that undergraduates were having sex in the room next to mine.
Author A. N. Wilson stated with facetiousness that I was gone after being forced to drink from chipped cups.
The truth was less funny.
I ran away.
Yes, I fled because I had been the victim of intimidation and constant bullying.
Not because of my rather outrageous name, nor because of the fact that I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one and only reason, and in this cradle of so-called knowledge, I was the victim of racist and barbaric behaviour: my late father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influential adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why talk about it today, you might say.
Well, recent studies have revealed that a new generation of center-right students are suffering the same kind of persecution.
The growing and institutionalised hatred of Tory students in Oxford is such that last week some of them demanded protection of their rights, along with those of gays, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Corpus Christi College Student Hall (JCR) said they were “often isolated, personally attacked and felt unwanted” because of their political views.
They want there to be a representative on the university’s Equal Opportunities Committee so that their views can be freely expressed.
Their situation was not helped by the recent BBC Two documentary "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", which depicted the "Tories" as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
It featured student Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), who rode in a Rolls-Royce, wore a silver suit and rode with a chrome head.
At other universities, conservative students say they are being treated like scapegoats for setting up tuition increases.”
Luke Black, 20, vice-president of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, told a Sunday newspaper “there is a growing left bias in universities.
People think we’re like the Bullingdon Club without even having met.”
Samuel Roberts, 21, a history student at Corpus Christi who proposed a motion for more protection, says such a climate is “uncomfortable,” and Stephanie Cherill, 19, president of the OUCA, says there has been a deterioration in the attitude of JCR members toward people who are center-right.
“This constitutes an obstacle to the freedom of intellectual debate, as well as to the well-being of members,” she said.
I was the only one to think so during my first few weeks at Oxford.
I entered in September 1986, I was then 18 years old and paralyzingly shy.
The hatred of the Conservative party was very virulent.
The previous year, the university had voted to deny Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary degree, because of the reduction in funding for higher education.
The atmosphere was laden with Stalinist vibrations.
From the first days of the host week, when the new students got to know each other and the professors, I got a taste of what was going to happen next.
I found that teachers not only participated in sarcasm towards Tory students, but also enjoyed it.
It was as if the policy about striking miners, privatization and government opposition to apartheid sanctions in South Africa were carved into the wood of the classrooms.
The first sarcasm I was subjected to concerned a translation into English of the French texts of the 18th century, and I was not prepared for it.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I lost my footing.
Pitt, a small man with a pustular face, was easily carried away.
"Do the Thatcherists refuse to learn French or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students laughed.
Tears were burning my eyes.
“I suggest you take French classes in your free time — well, if you’re not too busy making friends,” he said.
I went back to my room, inconsolable.
At dinner that evening, I sat alone and felt a slight tap on my shoulder.
It was a second-year English student named James who introduced himself as a member of the OUCA.
“I know who you are,” he said gently.
I'm afraid that's the way it is.
Anyone suspected of being a Tory (conservative) is targeted.
It's hard enough for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be even harder for you.
Most young Tory people claim to be Labour (workers).
Later, at the local pub, I cowardly tried to hide.
I insisted that I did not agree with everything that Mrs Thatcher had said.
This ploy has failed.
A first-year student of philosophy, political science and economics who, ironically, had studied at Eton, said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're contaminated.
Other students took up the refrain.
I was perverted, dirty.
"How do Tories make love?" asked one of them.
They hit each other, don’t they?”
I felt like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the sixties.
Could I have just lived a normal life in Oxford?
Would I have been forced to meet like-minded people only after nightfall?
Should I have become Labour and disavowed my views?
The next three years would be like a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only openly Tory professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history, who taught at my university.
He was hated not only because he was a Conservative, but also because he was Thatcher's foreign policy adviser and one of the authors of his speeches.
He was almost never there.
He hated this provincial and insignificant place, as well as its adherence to the Marxist-determinist point of view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
“You won’t be happy here,” he said.
I began commuting between Oxford and my parents’ home in London, finding refuge with my more open-minded family and friends in the city.
I told my father that I hated Oxford and I explained why.
He was incredulous.
During his studies at Oxford in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
“But it’s the best place in the world,” he told me pathetically.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city of dreamy bell towers.
Even my communist friends had impeccable manners.
He had tears in his eyes.
Give them a chance.
I'm sure it's to tease you.
It would break my heart if you left Oxford.
Tired of my frequent trips to London, my emotional stamina gradually deteriorated.
A friend, also Tory, succumbed to the pressure and gave up his beliefs.
During a session of directed work the following week, when another history professor suggested most seriously in the world that I was "an enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Embarrassed internally, I admitted to being a victim of my parents’ brainwashing and called them “crazy old men.”
The respite was short-lived.
It was my father who drove the last nail in my Oxford coffin.
At that time, he wrote two columns in Murdoch's press every week.
My door was locked.
I stayed up in my room, and after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed my bags and took the first train to London.
I never went back.
You can call me a whiny wet hen.
But no 18-year-old child should be the victim of such bullying in a school setting.
The most tragic is that it was Oxford, which not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but also enjoys an unshakable reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
As part of the exhibition "Valentino: a Master of Couture", inaugurated this week in London, ABC interviewed Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian couturier.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The couturier recognized him at the inauguration of "Valentino: a Master of Couture", a prestigious retrospective that brings together more than 130 haute couture models created for his fashion house over the last 50 years.
“I love this palace,” he said with his inimitable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the highlight of a story whose only protagonist is "Il Signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his famous clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and aside from the nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until March 3, we find an impressive number of private letters and photos signed by the cream of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino exhibits his personal memories as the trophies of his social ascent: from the modest couturier of the northern Italian town of Voghera to the idol of the international jet-set.
There is nothing wrong with loving royalty.
“At least they don’t crush their cigarette butts on your beautiful carpet like some pop music stars do,” says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and receives with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved being invited to his chalet in Gstaad," says the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, a close friend of beauties of the past such as Marella Agnelli or Eugénie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And even so, he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino model
The Argentine model, Valeria Mazza, has also not forgotten the charisma of the couturier.
Several years ago, after a parade in the Spanish Steps in Rome, we went to his apartment for dinner.
There were about 20 of us, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
We could see and feel his spirit in every detail of his apartment, in the decoration, the food, the music.
"With him, every guest felt important and appreciated," recalls the "top model", who began working with him during the Haute Couture week in Paris in 1995.
“He will never go out of fashion, because his creations are works of art,” she concludes.
Line of Nobility Parade
Garavani’s life is not a story of obsessions but of shared love.
He loves well-bred people with the greatest titles and they love him too.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous podium of sixty meters wide that offers to exchange roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and has to parade on the podium to admire a "public" of dream wearing the main creations of Valentino, as the tailor who had chosen Jackie Kennedy for his marriage with Aristotle Onassis, the costume that the "public" of dream wearing the main creations of Valentino, like the tailor who had chosen Jackie Kennedy for his marriage with Aristotle Onassis, the "
Among this public of models, we find names like Sybille of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sophie of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the couturier in 2006
Many of his customers say that the first Valentino clothes are like the first love, "impossible to forget".
I remember it perfectly.
It was a pants, a shirt, a vest "gillette" and a jacket from the autumn-winter collection 1971-1972.
"It's a gift he gave me," said Naty Abascal, one of the couturier's muses.
“I prefer him to all the others for his femininity, his great love of women, and because he sublimates our beauty,” the former Duchess of Feria adds.
I really like the colors he uses, they are bright and light up the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and fashionista Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can not forget the first time she wore a Valentino model.
When she was a teenager living in Italy, she dreamed of having the age and the opportunity to wear one of her evening dresses...
This was finally possible in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino model for a party in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red evening dress, with a ruffled skirt, a draped bustier and a drop-down neckline.
“It was a dream come true,” said Rodrigue d’Arenberg’s widow.
“Valentino is indifferent to fashion, he is obsessed with the timeless,” says the Italian aristocrat who divides his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess of Arenberg keeps the couturier's evening dresses with "the greatest care, because an evening dress is not only a dress, it is also the set of memories that it conveys".
The “King” of Fashion
The grand finale of the Somerset House exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress worn at her wedding to Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (the couturier calls his seamstresses) to make this ivory silk dress with inlays of pearls, twelve different kinds of lace and a train of four and a half meters.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a historical fact of haute couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return of high society customers".
Obsessed for years by the "know-how" of the nobility, Valentino is now its best representative.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any spouse of his clients.
"His refinement, his calmness, his neat and perfect appearance have always stood out to me," admits d'Arenberg.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d'Orsay.
He was sitting at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, one of my great friends.
"He was impeccable, the years have no effect on him."
If it's a princess who says so...
The Toughest Job in the World: Kawah Ijen's Human Mules
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and health by carrying 70 kilos of sulfur through the steep stone paths.
There are people for whom work is hell and others who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who make their living carrying the sulfur of the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
He must work every day to the bottom of the crater, where the sulfuric gas emanating from the bowels of the earth solidifies in contact with the air.
After collecting large sulfur rocks, which weigh a total of nearly 70 kilos, he installs them in two bamboo baskets that he loads on his shoulders through the steep paths.
There are only 250 meters to the summit of the volcano that culminates at 2,386 meters of altitude, but exhausted carriers take more than 40 minutes to climb this distance, at a turtle's pace, keeping the balance and measuring their steps so as not to stumble and fall into the precipice.
They know that a misstep could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who made a fatal fall in the Kawah Ijen volcano several years ago.
Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 euro cents for every kilogram of sulphur extracted.
Once at the top, they make their way between the tourists who photograph them as if they were circus animals, and painfully carrying the heavy baskets, they walk the 3 kilometers to the scale that a mining company has installed a little below at 1,850 meters of altitude.
This is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been operating the volcano since 1960 and, we can say, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 euro cents) per kilogram of sulfur.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) to the petrochemical industry since this ore is very present in daily life and is used to make candles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even serves to bleach sugar.
“As we carry about 70 kilos, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) each trip,” explains Anto, who generally makes three trips per day.
Each one takes him 3 hours and he ends up exhausted, but this allows him to earn 138,000 rupees (11.50 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems to be a misery for such a superhuman effort, it is triple what it would gain in the fields.
“The income of the miners is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros) a day and where the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros),” says the porter who once worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.20 euros) per day and the job was not as difficult, but Anto returned close to his family in Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a reason that, in Indonesia, is as indisputable as sulfur: "I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hinduists, and I converted her to Java".
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At 27, he spent three of his life defying danger on the Kawah ljen, but sulfur has already begun to make him pay the bill even though he covers his face with a mask and wears special gloves.
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases released by the volcano.
This is the price he must pay to pursue his dream.
“I’m going to work for two more years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French,” he promises in more than acceptable English.
Struck by life, this friendly and intelligent young man could be a tour guide, waiter or receptionist in a hotel, but instead he does the work of a mule.
It shares an unsanitary wooden house with other porters, rises every day at two in the morning because the sulfur does not stop gushing at night, when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and shines in the middle of the darkness.
Defying the darkness, Anto descends into the crater while illuminating himself with a small lamp attached to his helmet, which he bought himself with his own money.
Some 400 porters load the sulfur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater.
Despite its comfortable benefits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of sulfur to save costs and does not provide any equipment to porters who work on their own and are paid by weight.
In addition, they do not touch a penny of the 30,000 rupees (2.50 euros) increase per camera, in addition to the entry of 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros), which the guards of this natural park charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
“This job is for the animals, not the humans,” said Madrusin, a 42-year-old porter who has worked at Kawah Ijen for 30 years since he left college.
Able to carry up to 110 kilos, he assures that he will not stop working "as long as he can", because he needs money to raise his 3 sons, aged between 10 and 18 years.
I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although sulfur damages the throat and irritates the eyes when the wind turns and traps the miners in the thick columns of smoke that come out of the volcano, they are so hardened that no one complains of suffering from serious diseases ... to which are obviously added their usual respiratory problems, osteoarthritis, pain in the knees and shoulders, deformed shoulders.
By balancing the basket on his back, the 53-year-old Unainik can only carry 50 kilos.
Every day, he and his companions extract 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three trucks transport to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometers away by a goat trail invaded by weeds.
“I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life,” Unainik said, opening his mouth wide, revealing several missing teeth.
The eldest of her five children, aged 30, also works as a sulfur carrier.
Time passes, but the misery continues from generation to generation one of the most difficult jobs in the world: the one made by the human mules of the Kawah ljen volcano.
Singapore is looking for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame the lack of children on career, stress and the cost of home ownership.
"Singapore's population needs to grow."
I am a husband and a patriot, you are my wife and a patriot, let us fulfill our civic duty and give life!
It may seem unlikely that these lyrics come from an advertisement for mint lozenges, but despite this, or perhaps because of it, the video spread like wildfire on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The lyrics come from a rap group that uses local references such as "Let's put a polichinelle in the drawer" to mock Singapore's birth rate.
BBH, the advertising agency behind the video, hopes to draw attention to the problem in a fun way through this ad.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music to get people to fulfill “their national duty.”
It is intended only for the Internet, so we were able to make it entertaining and fun.
This is the main problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the area of births, so we felt that this was a topic that we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried several things, such as launching pheromone perfumes or organizing speed-dating parties.
Many of these ideas were creative, but they didn’t necessarily work.
So we thought, what could be more creative to solve this problem than making it into a rap song?
1.2 children
The Singaporean government does not take it so lightly.
It spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage its citizens to have more children.
A government measure in favor of marriages and fathers grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all this had little effect.
Singapore is a wealthy, high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
Singapore's birth rate, according to its national population distribution, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2, considered the renewal rate, was in 1976.
Why don’t Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of marriage and family policy at the National Population Division, says it’s due to “better education” and “a wider choice of career opportunities.”
“This has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond marriage and starting a family,” she explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in the number of singles and delaying marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at radically increasing immigration to counter population decline has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites abounding with barely disguised xenophobia against new immigrants, especially Chinese who are accused of pulling wages down and failing to integrate.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why Singapore’s ruling party had its worst election results since independence last year.
Since the elections, they have tried to correct the problem by setting higher quotas and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the fall in the birth rate has known effects on a country’s economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore’s example also has unintended consequences.
The government is trying to avoid the construction of many small houses.
For example, this has begun to affect the real estate sector.
Urban development authorities have begun to control the number of small apartments, known as “shoe boxes”, that can be built in specific areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and their sale is very successful.
However, authorities are concerned that they may promote a single lifestyle and discourage developers wishing to build large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, chief executive of real estate company EL Developers, says his “shoe boxes” are selling much faster than larger dwellings.
They are more popular, in the sense that these dwellings are built much faster than those of larger size.
For this reason, it is much more profitable for our treasury.
However, he admits that the new standards give clearer instructions to proponents, who were previously put in the wheel if they wanted to offer too many small dwellings in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
If these new regulations can be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, by talking to Singaporeans who work in the financial district of the center, it would seem that they will not have much effect.
“People are very stressed, houses are expensive, and so is education, which is why people put it off,” says one young executive.
Other people can have children.
"But for me, it's important to be able to have my money and my time," says another young man in his twenties.
Men and women cite their careers, stress and the cost of home ownership and education as reasons why they cannot have children.
So while the government is trying to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, Singaporeans themselves have the final say.
What is private offline is private online
Confidentiality
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy, it is about the quality of the private domain or "the area of private life that we can protect from any intrusion".
What is the private domain for children under 16 years of age?
How to apply this definition in everyday life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers to which he exposes himself by broadcasting events on the Internet that he would certainly not share offline?
The newspaper elPeri<0xC3><0xB3>dico interviewed five young boys, aged between 10 and 15 years, frequent users of the web.
In four of the cases, they associated the term “something very personal” on a personal level with “the password and username” when they applied it to social networks.
“I won’t reveal my most personal secrets in a post,” says Jorge, 10, when he tries to explain the meaning of the term private on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had an account for two years.
“These are very secret secrets, my mother can know them but not everyone,” he says.
On FB, I post cool images or games.
I also talk to my friends.
“I won’t share one of my pictures or someone who would be a fool,” he said.
The young boy acknowledges that it is wrong to post obscene photos, naked people, crimes or write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge says he knows his 35 friends on FB as well as his nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are family.
Her mother is one of them, she knows the password to one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account to express myself and write interesting tweets.
“I don’t know if they answer me, I just post them,” he adds.
“Social media is fun, I can talk to distant relatives or friends, quickly,” he says.
He said he would never accept the request of an unknown person.
Nor will he trust someone who would recommend a stranger to him.
The case of 14-year-old Jose is different.
The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on the latter, he admits not knowing 20 of the people registered on his list of friends.
“It doesn’t worry me because we have something in common, music for example,” he says.
According to the young boy, no one made advances or asked him for his address or phone number.
“If they put pressure on me or demanded it, I would simply remove them from my account,” he said.
José subscribed to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The experiences we know today as cyberbullying are not foreign to the young boy.
A friend of mine was hacked on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
“He never knew who it was,” he said.
The victim, according to José, did not close his account.
"He only passed it on in a private profile."
He then explains a series of manipulations to set up his account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this young man would post pictures of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would if I was angry or angry.
“Even though I know it’s cyberbullying,” he says.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, English teacher and graduate in Education and Learning, believes that to guide children and adolescents, we must understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet has emerged as a way to search for information, but with the emergence of these sites, the rule of the game has changed," she said.
Porras points out that academician Marc Prensky, who holds a master’s degree in pedagogy from Yale University and author of the book “Natives and Digital Immigrants,” uses these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives are the children and young people who were born with technology.
“We are the digital immigrants who have to teach them there, while we ourselves are learning,” she says.
He adds that the theme is complex, "because we ask them to have a defined criterion on what should or should not be disclosed, published or said at an age when they do not have the maturity to do so."
“We also ask them to be selective when what matters most to them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences.”
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach children and adolescents about privacy is to use questions that make them think.
“Telling them not to do it is useless,” she said.
Then Porras lists a few examples: there are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, would you like them to post a picture of you like that of a friend you posted?
Do you know what others post about you?
When you identify holiday photos, do you ask other people for permission to identify them?
And also, does everyone need to know what you are doing at every moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they have to act online as they do offline.
It's the same rules.
“Outside of the Internet, everyone must act with respect, morality and other principles, it must be the same on social networks,” she says.
Surveillance
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, primary school teacher and education advisor, says that it is essential that parents read the conditions of use of social networks conscientiously.
By understanding each of the terms, they will have a solid foundation to discuss with their children the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
“For example, age and what is allowed to be shared or published,” he says.
According to Guardia, it is essential to remind children not to talk to strangers.
The UNASUR Summit ended without the Lima Declaration being made public
The 6th Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) ended today in Peru without the Lima Declaration being made public, although it was previously announced and theoretically adopted by the 7 representatives present.
Efe has tried several times to access the document signed at the 6th Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of UNASUR, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency initially indicated that it would be disclosed after the summit was closed, and then claimed that it would be published at any moment on the website of the Peruvian government.
When questioned about the text, they reported that its contents had been exposed by the President of Peru, Ollante Humala, during brief statements to the press.
Journalists' access to information about the summit has been constantly limited.
During the day, only the video without the sound of the presidential assembly with the message "private session, restricted audio" was broadcast in the press room.
The little information that circulated among the journalists was that given by the press attachés of some of the governments of Unasur who attended the meeting, with the exception of the Peruvian spokesman.
The only document released during the day was the list of presidents present, which caused some unease among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who were demanding more important information.
Later, Peru’s presidency sent an email to the media with the “final declaration” of the summit, but it was President Humala’s speech and not the official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the 3rd South American-Arab Summit (ASPA) and, on this occasion, although it was strongly requested by the press, it also did not release the declaration also called the Lima Declaration, as had been previously announced.
On the official website of the ASPA, it can be verified that the document was published last March.
In both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities have tried to put in place safe transmission systems for all journalists, but they have limited the collection of information as much as possible.
The summit also concluded with the joint agreement of Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the Court of The Hague that settles a border dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era, met at the regional meeting and said they would respect the ICJ's decision to hear the pleas of both parties in the trial that Lima has filed against Santiago and which begins Monday in The Hague.
“We will respect and execute the verdict that will resolve the disputes that we are bringing today before this international court,” Humala said, alongside his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has always been, and will continue to be, a country that respects international law, the peaceful resolution of controversies, treaties and international tribunals," Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era said, shaking hands with Humala.
The confirmation of the two presidents that they would submit to the ICJ came after Colombia denounced this week the Bogota Pact by which it had agreed to submit to the decisions of this international tribunal, after a decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua that it considered to be seriously wrong.
The summit was held without the presence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the ouster of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
Host President Ollanta Humala was tasked with opening deliberations in the morning and closing the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The representative read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that the lines of action of 31 projects had been set between the South American countries for a total of 17 million dollars of investment.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the UNASUR countries would put in place "important steps to achieve the goal of South American citizenship through the development of agreements on residence permits".
He informed that actions would be put in place to improve "cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and international organized crime, actions for better access to medicines, low-cost Internet access throughout South America, and to jointly and effectively assess the risks of natural disasters."
With a Europe in crisis, "the economic consolidation (of Latin America) must not have a triumphalist matrix but must help increase our productive matrix and envision a better future for our people," concluded President Humala.
“We have decided to favor a group of 31 emblematic projects that improve the connection of the spaces of South America, especially in rural and border areas ... by uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits,” the Peruvian president said in a speech.
Among those projects, he mentioned that five concerned Peru and were on the transversal axes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and that two aimed at a greater connection with Ecuador, although he did not give more details.
Similarly, the outcome document mentions the political situation in Paraguay.
“We hope that the electoral process of this country will allow its reintegration into the Union of South American Nations,” from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and having good relations with its neighbours, is another theme addressed at the summit.
In this sense, the Colombian president, Juan Manuel Santos, said, before starting the regional meeting, that he hoped to meet his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, the following Saturday in Mexico City to calmly discuss the maritime dispute through an ICJ judgment requested by Bogota.
“It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday) I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega,” Santos said.
“We will review all these ways, they are not exhaustive, including the treaty with Nicaragua that will ask to have a discussion with that country,” he stressed.
“I hope I can tell President Ortega that we will resolve this in the most civilized and respectful way possible,” Santos said.
Presidents Santos and Ortega will meet Saturday in Mexico City where they plan to attend the inauguration of the country's new president, Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto.
Similarly, in the framework of the summit, the defense ministers of the bloc will meet in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which attempts to strengthen dialogue and consensus in terms of defense in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are part of UNASUR, although the latter country is suspended.
Peru holds the presidency pro tempore of the regional bloc.
“South America needs to learn from Europe how to integrate citizenship,” says Rafael Correa.
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, affirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal for which "South America, in this case, should take an example on Europe".
President Correa, who participated in the 6th Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), located in Lima, said on state television, TV Peru, that the Europeans "had killed each other in World War II" and other conflicts, "but that they now formed almost a homeland."
In this sense, he defended the project to establish a South American citizenship encouraged by the member countries of UNASUR.
"We must achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case for members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary areas that we want to make belong to the past," he warned.
In addition, the Ecuadorian president has been in favor of the reconstitution of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the aim of diminishing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account the signatories of the San José Pact on Human Rights.
Those who wink at us never compromise anything, on the contrary, we South Americans have all signed it.
“It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under U.S. funding,” he said, referring to Ecuador’s political asylum granted to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa says he does not regret his decision, because he himself did not betray his principles, but on the contrary he respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He concluded that at the time, “there were well-founded suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that his trial would not be respected.”
In addition, he criticizes the Swedish justice system, which has required him to submit to an interrogation on its territory regarding an alleged sexual offense while "the Swedish legislation itself allows it to be done by videoconference, which could be done from the Ecuadorian embassy in London".
Correa said there was a risk that Assange’s mental and physical health could deteriorate.
"I have not spoken to him since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, but nothing serious," he said.
It is possible that his physical and mental health deteriorates when he is confined to a small space without being able to exercise in the open air.
“It affects anyone’s health,” he concludes.
Correa points out that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, which would be the allocation of a safe-conduct that would allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities and he points out that he has had discussions in London in order to find a solution to the lockdown of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been ongoing discussions.
“The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities because Assange’s lawyer, Baltazar Garz<0xC3><0xB3>n, has launched a whole series of proceedings before different European bodies,” he said.
And he thinks that “if Britain granted safe conduct tomorrow, it would end.”
And if Sweden, as its legislation quite allows, and as it has done in other cases, questioned Mr. Assange in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, or questioned him via Skype tomorrow, the problem would also be solved.
Correa took the opportunity to reaffirm himself as a defender of freedom of the press and said that what he did not tolerate was "mediocrity, bad faith and lies that undermine freedom of expression".
“The greatest enemies of press freedom are not malevolent or perverse politicians but bad journalists in the pay of greed, blackmail and extortion,” he said.
In this regard, he welcomed the fact that this is not the kind of journalists "neither the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate in Ecuador" and, rather than putting forward his re-election, "he would deepen the revolution to continue on the path and chart the right path".
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto on Paraguay within UNASUR at least until the next elections, arguing that the organization "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and disguised coup attempts", because in reality, "it destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
Moreover, the Ecuadorian president considers as "perfectly relevant" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries through the judgment of the International Court of The Hague, which will strengthen the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua.
At the moment, this judgment is not respected.
This is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to move forward together.
We must resolve them as a whole to overcome them and move forward.
At the same time, he expressed confidence in the successful resolution of the maritime border dispute between Peru and Chile in the same court and affirmed that it is "beneficial for Latin America to bring the matter before international bodies if the two countries agree to accept a judgment as firm as it is".
Referring to the possibility of his presentation as a candidate in the future presidential elections in Ecuador, with a view to running for a third consecutive term, he said he saw this possibility "with a lot of optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite difficult".
Correa said that if he lost the February 2013 primary, he would withdraw from public life.
On a personal level, power has never interested me, but in situations as unjust as those of Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be resolved through political power.
"My political movement believed that I was the one who guaranteed this eventual victory, but we must accept this responsibility," he said.
If I won, it would be my last presidential term and then I would retire from politics.
If we ever lose, I will too.
"It's my decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro and he told me that routine medical treatment was already planned and that he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean a relapse in President Chavez's state of health," he said.
The Ecuadorian head of state participated today in Lima in the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which ended with a call for better regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS-related deaths today are due to late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed as HIV positive.
"It's as if the sky has fallen on my head," he said, referring to the time of the announcement, which the doctor had tried to make "less painful", in vain.
The young man hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness on his own and began to learn about it and his relentlessness was such that he just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is, without a doubt, one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit of the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), in which he found himself in 1994 after many battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 1990s, where there was a lot of doubt, little choice of treatment and more stigma.
Then, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye “because he was speechless”.
At that time, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and have a good quality of life.
However, ignoring their illness, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, "depleted" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, in any case after the first reported cases, "the great victory today is that the survival of a patient who has started treatment at the right time and the survival of the population in general is exactly the same," said the head of the HIV unit of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva in a scientific reference that this information was validated in April of this year.
Infectiologist and HIV/AIDS expert Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is no longer a life-threatening disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depends on the level of immune system involvement presented by patients up to 200 at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for those who do not consume a CD for 50 years and for those who do not consume a CD for up to 30 years.
To put it simply, this means that for someone who would receive an HIV positive diagnosis at age 25, “as long as it remains under control, will be able to live without problems up to 75 years,” explained the scientist interviewed.
In order to put this progress in context, it is necessary to know that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years on average.
While it is true that mortality has decreased significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has increased from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (according to the UNAIDS annual report), but it is also true that, since the onset of AIDS, 60% of the patients identified on the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and there were 187 deaths as of May this year; however, we are assured that access to antiretroviral drugs has been universal since 2005.
So why are there still deaths?
I don't think the problem comes from access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's what happened in our hospital.
In the last 12 years at least, we have never run out of drugs, the problem is that patients come to very advanced stages because they do not know that they are infected, or else they learn it in advanced stages of the disease.
“Nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have an opportunistic infection, what is needed to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to carry out earlier diagnoses and, for this, it is necessary to offer screening tests in a massive way, to all those who request it.”
Specialists and members of the State Council for AIDS Prevention of Jalisco (Coesida) agree on his proposal, as do patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who had to do his screening test in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done it and that, despite his young age, he was already a carrier of AIDS and suffered from Kaposi's sarcoma.
Everything changes when you learn that you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die and don't want to know.
“If I’m going to die, I’d better have fun three times a week,” they say, not me.
The change has been beneficial, I eat well, I exercise, I take my medication.
To this day, his parents only know that he has cancer.
I have a normal life, just like anyone else.
"I work, I have many activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but co-responsible, I pay attention to myself and the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to help, thanks to his testimony, those who are afraid today, during the World AIDS Day march.
Whether they do the test, if they have taken risks, the sooner they will know if they are HIV-positive and the better it will be, and if they already have the diagnosis, they must know that we can live like everyone else, by being responsible.
His message summarizes the slogan of the battle against AIDS in this year 2012.
Condoms on the counter
There are many gaps between health programs and the ordinary citizen, says Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has embraced the cause of HIV.
And the biggest one is prevention.
In all the places dedicated to this, "we have actually increased the distribution of condoms, before we were given one or two, now we are given packs of a hundred, it is very good, but it results, that even today, some do not have access to condoms," he says.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
The question: "What are you going to do with it?", asked with sarcasm and value judgments by social workers, guidance counselors, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that adolescents do not want to hear, says the journalist.
He proposes to reorient this inefficient distribution; that condoms not only be sold at counters, but that they be found in public toilet dispensers and in places frequented by young people.
It is not about encouraging promiscuity.
Nor is it a question of paying them the girls and the motel, as Governor Emilio González had responded when asked if there would be a distribution of condoms within his administration.
“This is not how sexuality works, it’s best to provide condoms to people who are already sexually active,” he said.
The numbers in Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 of AIDS and 1,317 of HIV).
The state is the fourth state in the country in terms of the number of new cases and cumulative cases of AIDS and 13th in the number of HIV patients.
92% of infections are caused by sexual contact, 6% by blood and 2% by perinatal infection.
It is estimated that 50,000 people are living with HIV, since for every recorded case, there are 4 or 5 people who are unaware of it.
A judgment upheld on appeal by a U.S. court ignores the restructuring of the Vitro group’s debt through a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico, setting a bad precedent for all domestic companies with branches in the neighboring country and with solvency problems.
It therefore seems that the survival procedures of the companies authorized by Mexican law are not valid in the country with the star-studded banner, in contravention of international agreements.
From a practical point of view, the blow to the judgment delivered on June 15 by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas, leaves Mexican companies defenseless against the possibility of embargo of their properties beyond the Bravo.
However, the resolution will allow Mexico’s top glass maker to take the case to the U.S. Supreme Court based on three inconsistencies.
First, while the judge in the case points out that creditors must register under the United States Bankruptcy Act, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, sitting in New Orleans, states that the main proceeding is formalized commercial bankruptcy in Mexico.
The first point would involve denouncing international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with a transnational profile.
Indeed, the United Nations Model Law for the Uniformity of International Commercial Law had been created for this purpose by using the American Law Institute as an arbitrator.
In the second place, the judgment establishes that without the intercompany vote, recognized in the critical mass of commercial bankruptcy, the debts contracted by subsidiaries of Vitro to the parent company, the majority required for the approval of the restructuring could not have been obtained.
However, Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, the Vitro case is not the first to use this plan.
There are a half-dozen examples here, among them Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose debts were guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Commercial Bankruptcy.
Moreover, what is certain is that, since there remained the votes of the subsidiaries, in any case the creditors of Vitro who fought against this in the courts of the United States, that is to say the “vautour” funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have obtained a majority.
The vote would have been 45 to 37.
An information omitted by the appellate court.
On the other hand, Vitro was blamed for the difficult situation he had been facing since 2008 without stopping at the serious economic crisis facing the United States, passing on the costs to the country.
For now, the González Sada family company will appeal to the same appeals court for the vote to be taken in its entirety, that is, with the five magistrates, since only three had voted.
The insurance claim will claim non-prosperity and require review of the lawsuit by a higher court, in this case the U.S. Supreme Court.
The most serious is that the court ignored a document sent by the Government of Mexico on behalf of the amicus curiae (“friend of the Court”) detailing Vitro’s procedure under the Commercial Bankruptcy Act, noting that it freed him from the conventions signed by the two countries to put him on the same level as paragraph 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
In addition, he pointed out that the country had complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules established for cross-border insolvency cases, which ensured fairness for debtors and creditors.
Carambolage of two parts: they knock out Vitro and they knock out the country.
Overall assessment
The complaints of the unions of the Mexican Aviation Society against the former boss of the company, Gast<0xC3><0xB3>n Azcárraga Andrade, were silenced for several months, he was accused of fraudulent administration, the Association Syndicale des Pilotes Aviateurs has already encountered problems.
The case, headed by Carlos D<0xC3><0xAD>az Chávez Morineau, has just filed a criminal complaint against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of obstruction of justice.
According to him, the inspection authority systematically denied having provided information to the Attorney General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the contractor to withdraw from the F/589 trust of the IXE bank 198 million pesos on behalf of the Mexicana de Aviaci<0xC3><0xB3>n.
The funds would have been used for the purchase of shares of the Professional Administration of Hotels.
As everyone knows, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
They besiege the Dragon Mart
Gathered over the weekend in an amphitheater of the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, university professors, entrepreneurs and members of civil society approved the creation of a broad front of opposition to the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
As you know, we are talking about a colossal sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from the Great Wall country, with a living area for the employees of 150 companies.
Previously, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of Industry and Transformation) had managed to unite the governors of the Southeast zone in order to oppose the monumental project that is partly on protected areas and represents the greatest of all threats to the industry.
ACTA is dead
The government put forward a Senate demand to explain under what terms and circumstances Mexico’s ambassador to Japan had signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known by its acronym ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property, this theme is already ancient history.
As everyone knows, it was a good thing that the Senate itself condemned this possibility, because it was considered an attack on freedom of expression on social networks.
Long-term homex

Hector "Hetin" Reyes "Basketball is my whole life"
Basketball globetrotter "Hetin" Reyes has spent more than 60 years of his life in connection with the field and, thanks to him, has traveled all over the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have as much knowledge of the history of local basketball as that of Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
The reason is that before a brain hemorrhage condemned him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, whether as a lower-league player, national basketball team player, manager and leader of the national team, the BSN, with the Vaqueros de Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n or as president of the basketball federation.
“I have worn several caps in basketball throughout my life, and even several at the same time, such as when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the national team and president of the federation during the 90s,” recalls Reyes during a visit of Primera Hora at his home in Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n, where he resides with Isabel, his faithful wife of more than 50 years.
“Basketball is my whole life.
Reyes is not exaggerating when he makes this claim.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memories that recall his extraordinary itinerary, testify to this.
Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n in the heart
Of all his memories, those he loves most are those that remind him of his time as a player on the Vaqueros team in the mid-1950s until 1982, after spending 15 years as co-manager or manager of the team.
“These were my best years, the ones I enjoyed the most because I had the chance to participate in eight Vaqueros championships from 1967, whether as a manager, co-manager or manager.
It has been many years of satisfaction, including the five championships played from 1971 to 1975.
I then retired from the championship in 1981, the year Jerome Mincy joined the BSN team.
From there, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, took the lead of the team, "says Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had been a leader here and was at the University of Alabama, Birmingham, said to me, "I have a big player for you, he's six feet tall.
Do you want it?"
That’s how Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had, started.
Bartow then recommended Raymond Gausse, who was naturalized and was one of the better shooters.
I remember him saying that if Mincy had allowed Bayamon to win one championship, Gausse was going to help us try to win another.
He enjoyed the Vaqueros championship with Gausse, but only remotely since in 1988 he was already the big manitou of the federation.
At that time, he preferred to take advantage of his and Mincy's positions in the national team.
I remember when we first won it in the United States at the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico City in 1989.
Then there was the 1990 World Cup, where we finished 4th and should have won the bronze medal if that Canadian judge hadn’t made us replay the last game,” Reyes said.
Is the 1990 World Cup team the best national team you've ever seen?
She is one of the best, just like the one who beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympic Games.
But my favorite is the one at the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and we beat the United States team, which was quite similar to the one that won the bronze at the World Cup.
This team was not only composed of Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico L<0xC3><0xB3>pez and "Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n" (Ortiz), there were also the young (Javier) "To<0xC3><0xB1>ito" Col<0xC3><0xB3>n and James Carter, the brothers Le<0xC3><0xB3>n (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to attend the World Cup in 90 because of a knee problem.
A team that may not be the best in terms of individuals, but it gave us a gold medal and great joy at the pre-Olympic tournament in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner replacing the players suspended by the imbroglio of the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, we won gold against all odds.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, this is Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n Ortiz.
His statistics at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level as did Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n.
And this without taking into account his trajectory in the different leagues for which he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's very hard to say.
We had a good team composed of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
In the youth, I really like the work that Leo Arill does.
For you, what is your greatest achievement within the federation?
Having been part of the most glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that in the early 1990s, the BSN had up to 17 teams in a season.
What do you have left to do?
There are things that I would have liked to have put in place, such as the regionalisation of the minor categories.
For example, the Ponce boys play only in their area and only play against teams from other parts of the island in the national play-offs.
Today, young people travel and play too much when it is not necessarily necessary.
I have at least seen the benefit of mandatory certifications and courses for leaders, field staff and referees.
That makes me happy.
What are you doing today?
In general, I listen to music, watch clips from my time on YouTube, take advantage of my grandchildren and, from time to time, attend basketball games.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been by my side.
Death of actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, became known worldwide for the lead role of John Ross Ewing, better known as J.R., in the television series "Dallas", in which he played an unscrupulous, fearsome and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as unscrupulous oil tycoon J.R. Ewing in the TV series “Dallas” became a symbol of avarice in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas," died Friday night of complications from cancer, according to a family statement sent to The Associated Press for Warner Bros., the production company of "Dallas."
“Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, again playing the ironic role he loved most,” the family said.
Larry’s family and close friends were with him in Dallas on this Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played his wife in the original series and the sequel, was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, her press secretary Jeffrey Lane said.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
“He was an exceptional person and he lived life to the fullest,” Gray said in a statement.
Doctors had diagnosed Larry Hagman with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and he had admitted to drinking heavily for many years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignant liver tumor and underwent a transplant.
Several years before "Dallas", Hagman had made a name for himself on television in the role of an ordinary guy in the NBC series "Jinny of My Dreams" from 1965 to 1970.
In it, he played the role of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered an alluring genius, played by Barbara Eden, and brought her home.
He also starred in two short-lived comedies, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971–72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
Among his film roles are critically acclaimed roles in "The Band", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was thanks to his masterful interpretation of the delightfully detestable J.R. that Larry Hagman enjoyed his greatest success.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and their relatives aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who Killed J.R.?", invented to fuel the suspense around an emotionally charged episode in which Hagman's character is nearly murdered, has generated worldwide speculation and millions of dollars in gambling.
Thanks to this, among other things, the series reached a record audience at that time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 episode, 41 million viewers were on average in front of their screens and made "Dallas" the second most watched entertainment program in the world, after the final episode of "MASH" in 1983, which had gathered 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. got her pregnant and then threatened to charge her with prostitution if she didn't leave town, but other people also had reasons to assault her.
Hagman played the role of Ewing as a corrupt and insatiable man with a charismatic smile: a dishonest entrepreneur and an unfaithful husband who was trying to have his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) interned.
“I know what it would take as an epitaph for J.R.,” Hagman said in 1988.
It should read, "Here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
Here's the only part he lost.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, recalled this Friday Hagman as a man "immense, both on the small screen and in life".
He is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, to millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of all of us, who have had the chance to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
The recording of five episodes is already completed for the second season and a sixth is in the works, the channel informed.
So far, neither Warner nor TNT have communicated how Hagman's death will be integrated into the series.
Originally from Fort Worth, Texas, he is the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who rose to fame with classic works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave birth to him in 1931 when she was married to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He made his first steps on the stages of New York theaters in the early 1950s and then served in the air force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
It was there that he met the young Swedish interior designer Maj Axelsson and married him.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for many years in the Californian town of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he titled his memoir "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life" (in French: Hello Darlin': Les mémoires pitilesses de J.R)
“I didn’t write anything in this book that would hurt anyone or affect them in any way,” he told reporters at the time.
After his liver transplant, he became an active organ donation activist and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist worried patients.
"I advise them, I give them confidence, I come with them when they come to have surgery and after," he says in 1996.
I try to offer them a little comfort, like, “Don’t be afraid, it won’t be easy for a little while, but it’s going to be okay.”
He was also an anti-tobacco campaigner and participated in several campaigns.
A course dealing with the "End of the World" has just begun
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when religion professor Stuart Charmé decided to give a course on the end of the world, he knew that he was launching an irresistible hook: the end of the "great countdown" of the Mayan calendar, on December 21, to which many people refer as proof of the imminent end of the world.
But Professor Charmé had no idea what awaited him in the following months: the catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, a fiscal chasm that some have dubbed “the Armageddon of debt,” and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where end-time Christian theorists thought the apocalypse would be triggered.
“I didn’t realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester I’ve ever known,” Charmé told his students at Rutgers-Camden University in New Jersey this week.
If we analyze what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and we told it, it was a very good time.
And we must remember that what is bad is good for those who believe in the apocalypse.
And he is not the only professor to give classes on "the end of the world" this semester, which will, in theory, be the last in history.
At Temple, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker teaches the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
“We analyze this because these ideas proliferate over time,” he said, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios guides some human behavior.
If nuclear weapons fall into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, students will analyze films with apocalyptic themes and study how they can be compared with real-life examples.
“I tried to inform my students about what was possible, probable, credible and impossible,” Vacker said.
On the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, Latin American History professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of Art History and Anthropology, teamed up to give a course, simply titled “The End of the World.”
"We are adding '2012' to have the opportunity to teach the course again, in case the world doesn't disappear," said Professor Restall.
Despite the "imminent disaster", students must study, create projects and take their final exams.
In the state of Pennsylvania, the final exam will be passed on the eve of the Apocalypse, leaving students no choice but to work “until the very night of the supposed end of the world,” Restall said.
The courses proved to be quite popular.
“It was complete in two hours,” Restall said of his course for high-level students, which consists of 35 students.
We received emails several weeks before the start of the semester from people asking if there was still room.
Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
“It fascinates me to see what people are able to do to comfort themselves,” says Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old religion and sociology student from Haddonfield, New Jersey, at Rutgers-Camden University.
For the fear of the Apocalypse, whether secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort, or lack of comfort.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old psychology and nursing student, claims to have watched all the apocalyptic movies.
“I had never heard of a course that taught this subject,” he said.
I appreciate that.
But none of the students interviewed, let alone a professor, told us they believed in the end of the world date of December 21.
“Our first project was about Mayan prophecy, and in a way we discredited it,” says Julie Zegle, a 21-year-old Temple senior from West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world, it’s just a key date on the calendar, Restall said.
But I concede that there is an apocalypse-related anxiety in Western culture, going back several centuries, that causes people to react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a surge in these speculations.
“In other parts of the world, people don’t think about it,” he said.
The majority of them are from the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a religion professor at La Salle University who is teaching in the Philippines this year, responded quickly when asked if he knew that classes were being given here on "the end of the world."
“The Philippines is not participating in the end of the world,” he told us, as if it were an exception from a higher authority.
We have a grace from the Pope.
Restall notes that over the years there has been talk of the many supposed dates of the Last Judgment, and he states that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophizing that December 21 marks the beginning of a 7-year period at the end of which the world will disappear.
Students and teachers take the date lightly.
Several told us that they thought they were going to "end of the world" parties.
“Sometimes I call friends and we laugh together,” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
