Austria’s right-wing populists triumph, they have 29 percent in total
According to preliminary results, the early parliamentary elections in Austria brought a significant weakening of the two parties forming the current grand coalition, as well as a notorious strengthening of the populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party (<0xC3><0x96>VP), where the position of the current president Wilhelm Molterer was seriously threatened, suffered particularly heavy losses.
On the other hand, the electoral leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZ<0xC3><0x96>), the governor of Carinthia J<0xC3><0xB6>rg Haider, is preparing a triumphant return to the political scene at national level.
According to preliminary results, the Socialists (SP<0xC3><0x96>) remain, with 29.8 percent of the vote, the leading political force in the country, nevertheless, compared with the 2006 elections, they lost 5.5 percent of the vote.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP, which with 25.6 percent lost nearly nine percent of the vote, ended even worse.
These are the worst results of the two major parties of the post-war period; especially for the popular party, which triggered the early elections, the result is literally catastrophic.
In early July, when the <0xC3><0x96>VP left the coalition, the People's Party had a considerable lead over the SP<0xC3><0x96>.
The voters apparently punished them for letting the government collapse.
From the first reactions to the results, speculation about the possible resignation of the party leader and the current vice-chancellor Wilhelm Molterer, were pronounced.
Observers believe that this could happen as early as Monday, at the extraordinary meeting of the party leadership.
Such a development would a priori facilitate the path to the outcome of the election which remains the most likely, namely the renewal of the grand coalition SP<0xC3><0x96> and <0xC3><0x96>VP.
Nevertheless, given the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the Free (FP<0xC3><0x96>) would have obtained 18 per cent and the BZ<0xC3><0x96> eleven per cent of the vote - the Socialists expressed at the same time the fear of a repeat of 1999, when the People's Party agreed with the populists (at the time, the FP<0xC3><0x96> was still united in a common government, it was in 2005 that the BZ<0xC3><0x96>'s
Haider, who has already said that he is ready to collaborate with any party and that he plans to return to Vienna, on the national political scene, apparently based on this development.
The last party to gain access to parliament was the Greens, but they lost slightly and fell from third to fifth place among the Austrian political parties.
Obviously, no other party crossed the four per cent threshold and did not gain access to parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India could cool down
If the problem of Czech researchers accused of illegal cockroach harvesting in India could not be solved, Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg said, there would be a certain cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
The minister said this today in New York, after meeting his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If the problem was not solved, then yes, a certain cooling would occur," he said after the meeting, carried out following a Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, coming out of the talks, that the executive branch could hardly intervene in judicial cases.
He did mention, however, that in the case of Petr <0xC5><0xA0>vácha, who was cleared of the charge and fined, the central government could negotiate with the local government, the Darjeling government, the case being under the Darjeling government's jurisdiction.
"His problem could be solved," said the minister.
According to Mukherjee, the best solution for Emil Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era, sentenced to three years in prison, would be to appeal to a higher court.
Therefore, he could ask for bail and await the judgment at large, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed, that his partner spoke in the same direction also during the talks.
"He advises to appeal to a higher court, after which he could be pardoned," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way in which the Czech side can intervene in this case is to provide convicts with “competent legal support,” the Indian minister said.
He also said that such assistance was already being provided to them by India.
“Above all, we want to keep with India the best relations, which have a tradition that has been going on for many years.
The Indians also recognize it," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told <0xC4><0x8C>TK, he stressed to his partner that the Czech Republic attached great importance to the problem of Czech entomologies.
“We regard the incarceration and prosecution of these Czech researchers as a big mistake,” he said.
The minister dodged the question of whether he had obtained a promise from India to deal with the matter.
“I’ve already received quite a lot of promises,” he said.
A Czech referees the fight for the seabed
It approaches a wall-mounted electronic map, showing Australia and adjacent marine areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but in a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia, as does the adjacent seabed.
Yet this area is as large as the continent itself," says Italian jurist Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the team of thirty members of the UN Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea.
Its head, the director of the division, Czech jurist Václav Mikulka, follows the presentation and completes it from time to time.
Ardour at work and enthusiasm characterize the prevailing atmosphere.
The seabed hides a little-known world so far, rich in natural resources.
There may be oil, minerals and other mineral resources, but also living organisms unknown at the moment, which may hold the key to the development of a drug against cancer.
A background larger than the dry land
The littoral states have today begun to vehemently aspire to the new underwater territories.
According to a UN convention, they are in fact using their rights, on which they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of what is called the continental shelf, which often extends several hundred kilometers from the coast of the given country.
The latter may, according to the convention, claim exclusively all the resources of the continental shelf.
For simplicity, the part of the seabed and its subsoil, which is a natural extension of the continent under the sea, is considered as continental shelf.
It extends beyond the limits of the littoral sea, often also beyond the two hundred nautical miles that represent the so-called exclusive economic yone,” explains Mikulka.
The request that the country in question submits to the Commission for the establishment of the external borders of the continental shelf, must be supported by a large scientific and technical documentation, based on many surveys and costly metrics.
It is the result of several years of preparatory work.
"One of our roles is to provide the committee with legal and scientific-technical assistance.
So far, the committee has dealt with five requests, from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three countries mentioned have been successful,” Mikulka adds.
The success of Australia, which was the first to significantly expand its underwater holdings, has recently had a global impact.
New Zealand, too, has gained territory - the extent of the seabed, which the commission attributed to it last week, corresponds to 1.6 million square kilometres, which is the country's extent multiplied by six.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in prospecting.
The benefits they will derive in the future from the exploitation of the seabed will, as they project, be invaluable.
Gradually, other countries will, in turn, submit their applications.
They can do so within ten years of ratifying the "Montego Bay Convention".
There, where the continental shelf ends, begins the area of the ocean floor, proclaimed by convention "common heritage of humanity".
There, no longer any state enjoys an exclusive position.
The right of extraction in this area is granted by an international institution established by convention.
"Nevertheless, make no mistake, the seabed is not a Klondike," Mikulka said, exaggerating, adding that "its areas are precisely clearly defined and their regime anchored in a contract."
Czechs in the Pacific
Today, part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states of the former Eastern Bloc within the framework of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991, under the Convention, the Commission, together with investors from a few other States, obtained the status of a so-called "pioneer investor".
It has the right of extraction in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area prospected by the investor slightly exceeds the area of the former Czechoslovakia.
The background is turbulent, it is a kind of underwater replica of the Tatra.
“It is possible to extract it over an area with a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area represents a deposit rich in polymetallic concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," said Ind Pakshi Rajan, another jurist.
Rober Sandev, a Macedonian employee of the division, provides an example of such a concretion.
It recalls a small potato, or, with a little imagination, the mythical shoem, which, according to legend, animated the Golem.
German special forces were on hand to free the hostages.
The Egyptian government had asked Germany for help in resolving the hostage crisis - the experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special units stood ready but never took action.
More and more details about the circumstances of the release of eleven European tourists kidnapped in Egypt are revealed.
According to the indications of the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defence, the German special forces also indirectly participated in the rescue operation.
For example, specialists from the Federal Army and officials from GSG 9, the Federal Police Air Squadron and the Federal Criminal Police Office, as well as logistics experts from the Technischen Hilfwerk were at the release site.
As the spokesman for the Ministries communicated on Monday evening, the German forces were finally not required, the hostage takers having released their prisoners and having fled when they recognized the imminence of a release by force.
The Egyptian Government would have accepted the assistance offered by Germany to integrate it on the ground as a support force.
"Fortunately, this has not happened so far," a spokesman for the federal interior ministry said.
The attackers had kidnapped in southern Egypt the group of tourists consisting of five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian companions.
After their abduction in the desert south of Egypt, the hostages were transbathed in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostage-takers has so far remained unclear, as have the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Those who were rescued have meanwhile arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages were under the protection of the German embassy.
He said nothing about the details of the release.
In Berlin at the moment, no information has been given on the date of their return to Germany.
According to "Bild" magazine, the five vacationers and special forces are expected to have taken off aboard an Airbus of the air force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. House of Representatives Rejects Rescue Plan
The first chamber of the US Congress has narrowly failed the rescue plan of the financial markets heavy of 700 billion dollars.
The Dow Jones tumbled into the abyss.
With 227 votes to 206, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government’s bailout of financial markets.
Despite all the calls from U.S. President George W. Bush and politicians at the helm of both parties, the program that was supposed to stem the chaos of the financial markets did not win a majority.
In a dramatic move, the partisans had desperately tried to convince opponents of the merits of the $700 billion plan.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic representatives during the debates, had called for a favorable vote although the plan was unpopular.
“It’s hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that hasn’t happened yet,” he said.
During the vote, the Dow Jones fell more than six percent, or 600 points.
The reason for this was investor concern that the state bailout could backfire.
It went up shortly before the end of the vote, and then, after the announcement of the failure, fell again.
Experts are now projecting further severe turbulence in international financial markets.
In order for the program to come into effect, the approval of both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate is required.
Organizers report a growing number of bookings
This should be a good winter for German travel agencies:
In terms of bookings for the coming months, according to a study, the turnover has increased significantly compared to the previous year - for the winter season, even more than 30 percent.
Despite the weak economic outlook, the Germans’ thirst for travel remains insatiable according to this study.
With regard to bookings for the winter season, travel agencies recorded a turnover of more than 31 percent compared to the same period the previous year, as entrusted Monday in Berlin by the German Federation of Travel Agencies (DRV).
According to the survey by the GfK Market Research Institute, increasing booking figures are already dominating the autumn months.
Thus the sales figure would have risen to about more 11 percent compared to 2007, said DRV.
The sources of these results are figures from GfK, which analyses monthly booking data from 1200 travel agencies and makes estimates for the overall market.
Travel bookings made since the end of August 2008 would be recorded there.
Due to the low price of the dollar, travel to the U.S. would be particularly in demand, the DRV said.
There, the increase in bookings would amount to about one-third.
Besides this, Spain, Turkey and Greece as well as our country would be destinations particularly sought after by the Germans.
Specially organized trips are in high demand, explained the president of DRV Klaus Laepple.
In view of the rising prices of energy and food products, the costs here would be "more easily calculated for the customer than for an individually organized trip".
Consumers can save money, among other things, with discounts on early bookings or All Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months have also been very successful so that an increase in sales figures will again be recorded compared to last year - although according to another study, the number of Germans who undertook a trip has decreased compared to the previous year.
My first time at the Beer Festival
The hits of Ballermann or Apres-Ski continuously, beer in pitchers per liter and celebrities in Tyrolean designer costumes.
An event at the beer festival.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I don't actually have much in common.
She is blonde, TV host and wears a tailor-made Tyrolean costume.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is second-hand.
But one thing connects us: barely three minutes to the beer festival, and already the photographers throw themselves on us and fill their memory card - very flattering, and this at my first visit to the beer festival.
That's how we make friends.
The cheap Tyrolean costume seems to achieve its goal.
As a beer holiday tourist and normally living north of the Equator of the Wei<0xC3><0x9F>wurst, my sense of well-being in traditional costume was so far limited.
But once in the Place Thér<0xC3><0xA8>se, everything is half less worse.
Almost everyone wears a Tyrolean costume or leather pants; no one looks blasé or ashamed - this is completely normal.
Only the apron of my Tyrolean costume gets a few weird eyebrows at the bananas-choc<0xC3><0xB3> stand.
A Bavarian woman points out that I would have tied my apron badly: "to the left means free, to the middle virgin, to the right boxed, to the back widow."
Discreetly, I tripped my loop from the back to the left.
"That's better," she said and laughed.
Others don't do as much trouble for these subtle flirting techniques and wear simple pens, on which is written "Too drunk to get dressed!" and exposes their naked backstage without being invited.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitude is called Bob, comes from England and comes for the first at the beer party.
He finds it "gorgeous", with an elongated "ooooo".
He told me all of this after relieving himself of the booze he had drunk before.
Right next to this fire hydrant that everyone thinks is a garbage can.
So Bob is one of those infamous "wild pissers."
Others don’t have the chance to get rid of alcohol this way.
Around eight o'clock in the evening, bunches of rescuers run to the party square and have to take care of the poor drinkers.
The nurses intervene rather in packs - always by four, they drag their stretcher covered with tents in tents.
This is how it works for most visitors to the beer festival: we go empty, we come back full.
Those resting in the coffin of the drunkards under the tarp are not visible.
"They're the ones who can't swallow anything anymore," one of the rescuers yells in response to my question and then disappears into the fray.
Accident Victim Identified by Police
A 63-year-old pedestrian who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle has been identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road to Brentwood, was involved in Friday afternoon's accident in town on Shenfield Road.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital, Romford, but later died there.
Following the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving.
He has since been released on bail.
Turkey is expanding its diplomatic horizons.
Long before Turkey thought of joining the European Union, the European powers were eager to enter its hinterland.
On the eastern side of the Bosphorus, perhaps 20 paces from Asia, lies one of the finest relics of its fallen imperial ambition.
Hydarpasha Railway Station was designed in a Neo-Renaissance style by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu.
At least that’s what the guides tell us.
The monument is arranged on horseback at the bottom of the platforms, equipped with observation towers at each of its angles, like some German provincial town halls.
The stones are dirty.
The whole building is in ruins.
But once inside the vaulted ticket office, we no longer have any doubt as to the size of the company, which represents a passage to the west.
The station was inaugurated in August 1908 by a German association, the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, late to the game of imperialism, wanted to realize its medieval ambitions of domination thanks to this railway that arrives in Damascus, Baghdad as well as the land better known as Saudi Arabia.
But German imperialist ambitions collapsed during the First World War.
Its railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, engendered by the icy borders of the Cold War, is over.
. The British and Imperial forces advanced beyond Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
But there was also bad news for Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, a train loaded with ammunition exploded, destroying its subtle roof.
Turkish sources say it is sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly fallen into ruin, engulfed in the twists and turns of history.
But today, the railway passage to Anatolia and all the eastern points serves, at least symbolically, to underline Turkey's widening diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has created a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, engendered by the icy borders of the Cold War
Now is the time for a new commitment policy.
The Turkish government has remarkable relations with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To judge the parameters of this new foreign policy, I boarded a sleeping car in the direction of the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit Turkish MP AKP Su<0xC3><0xA2>t Kiniklioglu, one of the foreign policy experts.
The next morning, after a ten-and-a-half-hour journey, jostled on noisy rails whose cadence was reminiscent of the old world of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I finally arrived in the Turkish capital – presented as a new city of a new secular state, turning its back on its German past.
But the AKP, with its well-known Islamist roots, represents an example of a change in the Turkish consensus.
He suspected the West, and especially Washington.
A taxi accompanied me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern structure, expressly built of stone and steel, in a developing neighborhood, surrounded by half-built shopping malls and by many bakeries in which middle managers in suit-tie-men and women-meet for morning business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could have been a centre-right politician from any other party in Europe.
Suit, tie and he even has a Black Berry.
"The aim of this foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly,” he said.
Turkey has been cut off from its back country.
Now she has to look east and west at the same time.
That was not the case with both of them.
She had to do both.
“But at some point, I asked, ‘Shouldn’t Turkey choose?’
“Turkey,” he said, “doesn’t want to have to choose between the two.”
He then pointed out an aspect that almost all those with whom I was able to speak, recited to me by heart: The Turkish railway does not only go to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus, and around the Black Sea, it is therefore, as much an advantage for Europe and the United States as for Turkey itself.
With the integration of Turkey, the message seems to draw a Europe traveling metaphorically on the rails to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at the Hydarpasha station, after another sleepless night, I thought back to those two Germans, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who followed the construction of this building 100 years ago.
They would have been surprised to see that the European ambitions of the Middle East could, in large part, be in the hands of Turkey.
As I waited at the terminal, the ferry crossing the Bosphorus, I remembered the period when Turkey had been called "the sick man of Europe".
At least, there is no longer any doubt on the continent that could claim this fascinating country.
Memoirs of Vernon Handley, and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: Music Director at Guildford since 1962, Vermon "Tod" Handley (died 11 September) was in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Already part of his musical project for the city, he founded the following year, the fantastic youth choir, Proteus.
The chorus was supposed to include those under 21, but before Proteus could sing his last song in 1979, many of us who were over 20-years-old refused to give up the chorus.
The name "Proteus" (which changed shape according to mythology) represented the willingness and ability of the choir to handle any type of music presented to it, whether madrigal or Messianic.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often impressive, always exciting, and this thanks to the inspiration of a single man, and his enthusiasm for music, which remained constant over the years.
Remember how Tod used to tell us to "let the music speak for itself".
He would have said, "The composer knows what he wants."
It’s all there, in the music.
So sing!"
His wand technique was absolutely clear, precise, even if never dictatorial or appearing.
Whatever the musical standard, he raised it much higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If a driver is to be knighted, it's Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the decades from 1962 to 1982, when he was conducting the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the past 40 years, I’ve seen more than a hundred of his concerts, and I can honestly say that none of them have ever disappointed me—and, at times, they’ve even inspired me.
Tod Handley had such a rare combination of greatness and personal modesty.
He hated drivers who, he said, “only focus on certain people.”
He will be missed by many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
His obituary of William Woodruff (died September 25) states that "in 1946 he had resumed his studies in economic history, at Oxford, and became in 1950, a member of Houblon-Norma research, while he was doing a BSc, an MA and a PhD".
That’s what came out of Woodruff’s letter in Beyond Nab End, but that’s not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was Professor of Economic History at the University of Nottingham, completing at the same time a PhD thesis on the British plastics industry, under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers; it was then published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
In the 50s and 51s in the United States, he studied at the Norman Hops, and in the summer of 1952, at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason Woodruff chose to hide this part of his past remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
“I recommend José Vicente Resino’s exhibition ‘Flamenco and Life’ because his black and white photographs, a documentary style, are fantastic.
They caught my attention because of their simplicity and the strength they convey and because they always treat the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that conveys a lot of feelings.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments."
Second assault for Honda's super sales
In November, Honda will begin marketing the second generation of the Jazz model.
If its predecessor already had a good habitability, this new minivan has an even larger interior space.
Added to this are a few refined mechanics, which increase driving comfort and save more fuel.
An evolution in the face of a revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Honda Jazz presents a line very similar to the previous model, the changes introduced in this minivan are numerous.
Among them, there is an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
However, before reviewing the new model, it should be noted that this new Honda Jazz comes six years after the release of the first generation.
First of all, it is observed that Honda renovated this model in a shorter time than that of other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, the Honda Jazz is less known, this model is a phenomenon of sales in other markets.
This is the case in Japan, where the Honda Jazz was the most marketed car in 2002 and also in 2008.
In Japan alone, nearly one million Honda Jazzs have been sold since its launch.
The Old Continent, with more or less a million cars sold in six years represents is in second place.
However, Honda claims that this new Jazz will allow it to increase its sales in Europe.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese brand marketed 83,000 Honda Jazz, in 2009 it plans to sell 100,000, which would represent a growth in sales of 17% in the European market.
In the Spanish market, Honda has sold 8,000 Jazz since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda’s sales in Spain.
The Spanish subsidiary hopes to sell 2,000 Jazz in one year.
It is precisely the release of the new Jazz that will allow Honda to largely offset the decline in sales in Spain.
Indeed, the brand's managers hope to end the year with a sale of 22,000 cars, that is to say 4,000 cars less than in 2007, a decrease in sales of 16%.
Thanks to this increase in sales, Honda has increased its market share in Spain, reaching a market share of 1.8%, up from 1.6% last year.
The Japanese brand also hopes to achieve a market share of 2% in 2010.
Honda hopes to get that market share when the new model comes out.
This is the Insight, a five-door, compact-sized hybrid – 4.37 meters in length – on which the Japanese company hopes to market nearly 200,000 cars a year worldwide.
Depending on the markets and according to the Japanese manufacturer's estimates, 50% of Insight's sales will be in the United States, while the remaining half will be distributed between the Old Container and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is expected in the first three months of next year, after its public presentation in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz is growing in size.
Its length reaches 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), its width 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the distance between its axes is 2.50 meters, which represents an increase of five centimeters.
On the other hand, the height does not change is 1.52 meters.
The dimensions increase and so does the interior space.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the introduction of a new platform and, on the other, to the introduction of a fuel reserve in a central position, a solution also adopted for the Honda Jazz.
In the same way, the trunk capacity – which has a double bottom system – can hold up to 399 liters, 19 liters more capacity compared to the first generation trunk.
It should be noted that these dimensions are those of the version with a 1.4L engine, since the trunk capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2L is 379 liters.
The other innovation – in addition to exterior elements such as the taillights or the panoramic roof – is improved access to the rear seats.
The doors that give access to the rear seats have an opening angle of 80 degrees, compared to the rear doors of the first Jazz that opened with an angle of 67 degrees.
The engines are also new on this second generation of Jazz.
At the beginning of its commercialization, this small model will be equipped with two gasoline engines of 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both engines feature i-VTEC technology that reduces fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, makes the engine more powerful and increases engine speed.
The first 1.2-liter engine delivers 90 horsepower at 6,000 rpm and 114 Nm of torque at 4,900 rpm.
This engine - which on the previous Jazz reached 78 horsepower - has a fuel consumption of 5.3 liters per 100 km and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous engine, which on the previous generation reached 83 horsepower, now reaches 100 horsepower.
This 100-horsepower Honda Jazz 1.4L has a combined fuel consumption of 5.4 liters per 100 km and emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
The 'bee car' that avoids collisions
To advance the development of technologies for accident prevention, Nissan has been inspired, this time, by nature, especially bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, by imitating the theft of bees, avoids accidents.
It is called Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C and represents the first steps towards collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at Nissan Motor Co.’s Advanced Technical Center made the tiny robot in collaboration with the Center for Advanced Science and Technology Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, the General Manager of Public Relations for Technology and Brand Management Research and Development, the BR23C represents the rise of the Nissan Safety Shield.
This robot will allow the vehicles of the brand to prevent collisions.
During its flight, each bee creates its own personal space of an oval shape that closely resembles the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important are the compound eyes of the bee, able to see at an angle of more than 300 degrees and in all directions, which allows it to fly without interruption within its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, the engineers developed what is called a Laser Range Finder.
It detects obstacles that are over a distance of two meters and within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to this object and sends a signal to the microprocessor, immediately, to avoid the obstacle.
“The moment it detects an obstacle, the small robot will mimic the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by forking its wheels 90 degrees or more to avoid collision.
The biggest difference compared to any other existing system is that the escape maneuver is totally instinctive.
If this were the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles, "explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Displacement Laboratory and main engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be diverted up or down, or diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and according to what its wheels allow it and not in infinite directions like bees.
For this reason, Nissan used a rotation function, but also acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot can avoid obstacles.
"Every second this device must only process information and act on that data.
It does not need to retain the information or intuitive logic of previous maneuvers, which is why it can work continuously with only a few dozen KB of memory.
This may come as a surprise, but we’re not talking about gigabytes of memory, or even megabytes.”
This represents the first car to develop new technologies for instantaneous collision prevention, a technology that will be introduced in production cars in about ten years after Nissan.
The robot runs on lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion batteries.
The other possible application of this technology in the future could be the adaptation of this device on a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to his destination avoiding obstacles on the road.
They are afraid of being mortgaged.
It must be recognized that the Treasury of the United States, in addition to having a lot of liquid to make plans, is not without geniuses.
Faced with the crisis, and to prevent Americans from embarking on mortgages with solvency banks, they created a game to learn not to go bankrupt: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
That is to say 'the Hotel of bad credits' ... or stories.
The gloomy aspect of this accommodation and especially the Master of Hotel leads us to think several times if it is the right time to apply for a loan.
And, most importantly, where to do it.
Of course, this game gives useful information but not very detailed.
This is more of a game for teenagers.
What to do if the game ends?
Since a dream room appears inside the hotel.
It is better than nothing, since it is unthinkable to buy a house
Morgan Stanley opens its capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley has announced the entry in its turn of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first bank of Japan, which will disburse nine billion dollars to take 21% of its capital, a news welcomed by a sharp drop in its stock market price.
A week after unveiling a tentative deal, the two banks explained that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley common shares at a unit price of $25.25, a total of $3 billion.
The retained price is 19% lower than the book value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in the acquisition of convertible securities with a return of 10% and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley said the overall transaction would be based on an average unit price of $29, or 28 percent above its current price.
Morgan Stanley was down 6.79% at $23.07 around 17:00 GMT.
“This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to banking holding status,” said John Mack, Morgan Stanley’s chief executive officer.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new status last week, which should allow it to diversify its activities but puts it under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
Its alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing the biggest names on Wall Street to adopt a much more cautious attitude than before.
The terms presented on Monday also show that the agreement has been modified in recent days: last Monday, Morgan had simply announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to the Japanese for about $ 8.5 billion.
“A week ago,” Toshihide Mizuno, MUFG’s executive director, told Tokyo, “we thought the stake would be made up entirely of common shares.
But given the current situation of the economy and the market, we wanted to minimize the risks and cover ourselves."
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley securities 7% below their book value.
And the deal will result in a dilution of about 20% of earnings per share.
Under the agreement, MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred securities into common shares within a year if they trade more than 50 percent above the conversion price, or about $47, over a period of time.
Morgan Stanley said the capital provided by MUFG will enable it to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase liquidity.
A spokeswoman for the group, however, declined to elaborate on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
Following the MUFG investment, Morgan Stanley is expected to have a Tier One solvency ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said it had "clearly" reduced its balance sheet since the end of August.
The past few weeks have been trying for the group, which has seen its stock price halve as the cost of insurance against a default risk on its debt soared.
This cost was declining on Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other “survivor” of the big Wall Street investment banks after the bankruptcies of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the takeover of Merrill Lynch, announced it had raised $15 billion, in part from Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway group.
Rafael Correa in Quito on Monday.
Refounding the republic around the socialism of the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, like his counterparts and friends, it is the third that put to the vote a draft of the new Constitution.
64% of voters voted “yes” in the referendum, according to official results for 80% of the vote.
According to these results, the "no" got 28%, 7% of the votes were null and 0.7% were white votes.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to get half of the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two polls conducted outside polling stations and a tally from a non-governmental organization had announced a wide victory of "yes", placing it between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had claimed in the night of Sunday to Monday the victory of his draft of Constitution.
The "constitution has triumphed overwhelmingly," he assured, congratulating Ecuadorians at the headquarters of the governorate of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
As of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chavez and Morales but also his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The election, which took place quietly according to the observer mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), focused on a text in 444 points consolidating the "new socialism" defended by the president.
The draft Constitution enshrines the power of the state over the economy, reserving for it the "development planning" of a country living essentially from the extraction of oil by foreign companies and the currencies sent by its emigrants.
Supported by Correa, who was elected in 2006, the project also grants the head of state enhanced powers, who will be able to serve up to two consecutive four-year terms and will have the opportunity to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will use that power and seek a new term in February 2009.
The Constitution also consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the President has begun to establish in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
It also provides for a ban on the presence of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for U.S. anti-drug operations.
All 19 hostages released in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched the assault against the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions held captive for ten days in the desert were brought safely back to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they had been released by an Egyptian commando in Chad.
Apparently in good shape, the hostages arrived at about 3:30 p.m. on a special plane at the al-Maza military base, next to Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transferred, without being able to speak to the press, on helicopters to the hospital in Maadi, a residential suburb of Cairo, for examinations.
They are in "good health" and "no ransom has been paid" to the kidnappers, Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna said on the tarmac.
Captured on September 19 during a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been tossed from one cache to another by 35 unknown kidnappers.
It includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the agency Aegyptous, organizer of the safari.
An Egyptian security official said 30 members of the special forces, flown aboard two helicopters, had launched the assault in the night just before dawn.
"An exchange of gunfire occurred, and half of the abductors were killed, the others fleeing," the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
He said that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the “lightning” unit had been sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commandos.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini mentioned from Belgrade, where he is, the role played by secret agents and elements of the Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of our intelligence, special forces men," he said, without elaborating.
He also denied paying a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese army claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle with the abductors on board, killing six, including the Chadian leader, and arresting two.
The army claimed they were linked to a Darfur rebel group, the Sudan Liberation Movement-Unity (SLA-U), which the movement immediately denied.
Letters - The Silent Majority of Culture
A debate on the financing of culture is making headlines and occupying the current election campaign.
All the better.
But one area of our cultural life is still forgotten.
Who will stand up to denounce the sums of misery that are given to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historic sites that are dying of hunger?
What politician will dare to remind the federal government that it neglects its monuments and heritage buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we do not have real laws that effectively preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government is devoting three and a half million euros to the restoration of the only Ch<0xC3><0xA2>teau de Chinon in the Loire Valley?
Among our American neighbors, it is written in the Constitution of their country that the protection of heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected officials and all government departments, and this, in consultation.
In Quebec, the Fédération des sociétés d'histoire du Québec, at least 40,000 volunteers from 211 historical, heritage, archival and genealogical societies are concerned with excavating history, preserving three under heaps of private archives and preserving archaeological remains.
It is they, often, who are the watchdogs of our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when promoters and decision-makers throw their bulldozers at our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When, a forum for history and heritage?
Benelux governments nationalize part of Fortis bank
The Benelux states are helping the Belgian-Dutch bank, as the first European bank in distress following the snowball effect of the credit market crisis in the United States, by partially nationalizing it. The three countries support, to the tune of 11.2 billion euros, this financial and insurance institution also having interests in Hungary.
This weekend, the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments agreed, at the highest level, on this case, also calling on the European Central Bank and the head of competition of the European Commission.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the international financial crisis, which has been escalating for more than a year, is for Fortis Bank. From a certain point of view, the decisions that will be taken in the case of this bank will serve as a precedent.
In accordance with the decision taken on Sunday night, the three states will buy back nearly half (up to 49%) of the capital of the bank located in each of the countries.
The bank will, no doubt, sell a part of its stakes, among which, first of all, the activities, mainly insurance, which it acquired last year from the Dutch organization ABN Amro.
In the second half of the week, serious signs of crisis have already been revealed at the bank.
Analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is far too big to be allowed to go bankrupt.
On Friday alone, the company’s shares fell 12 percent to their lowest level of 14 years ago.
Since January, stocks have fallen by more than two-thirds of their value.
Taking into account the current value of the shares, the total value of the capital of the group is around 14 billion euros, which, according to the company's executives, is not realistic.
The management of the company accuses the uncertainty across the Atlantic, in connection with the adoption of the US rescue plan of $ 700 billion, to be at the origin of the fall of the Fortis shares.
On Monday, the papers have already benefited from a slight increase.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed as the bank’s new chief executive officer.
The financial institution was also looking for private buyers, but has not yet received a proposal on the merits.
Previously, the Belgian government announced that investors should not worry, they were not going to lose their money.
No panic was felt in the bank’s customer circle and no agency was stormed.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent agencies and has also acquired leasing companies.
A fox in the chicken coop
In America, life and health insurance companies frequently refuse to sign an insurance contract with an applicant, based on information about his or her drug purchases.
Information protection experts fear the data market will spiral out of control.
"There are data protection programs that link the use of information regarding the prescription of medicines, in any case, to the consent of the person concerned.
This kind of program has to be in independent hands, otherwise it’s like putting your chicken coop in the hands of a fox,” Richard Dicket, the creator of the program used to manage prescription drugs, told the Washington Post.
Insurance companies depend on the insurance premium and the insured capital in case of damage, on the state of health of the client who presents himself, and if they consider that the risk is too great, they do not even insure it.
In the past, they sent candidates for a medical examination, and they only signed an insurance contract with them after learning the results.
For the past ten years, Dick has found a much cheaper procedure: from an identification number, data on the person's drug purchases in the past eighteen months is easily provided to pharmacies. From this, the program determines itself, from which disease the person suffers and what is his state of health.
For example, if this person regularly buys high doses of cholesterol reducer, this refers to an extremely high level of fat in the blood, which immediately puts them in a higher risk category.
Several versions of this program are in circulation. Some determine at the same time a risk factor, so there is not much left to do to the insurer apart from the paperwork. However, tiny problems can still appear.
Disadvantages of this program include the fact that a drug can be used for different purposes. For example, some mixtures can be used against migraine or hot flashes, but can also be effective against depression.
The latter is considered by insurers as an aggravating risk factor, while the others are not.
Companies have developed in the research and analysis of data. They must seek permission from the patient before collecting necessary information from the pharmacy.
From now on, they are forced to do so by the authorities, even if they have not been punished for their failures in the past.
Recently, some companies have also been processing the results of laboratory analyses and linking them with data on drug use, thus being able to provide an even more accurate picture of patients' health status.
More and more companies have access to data, and controlling usage is becoming increasingly difficult.
There is a separate law on the protection of medical data, but its scope of action extends only to practitioners and insurers.
A bill to widen the circle of control of the authorities concerning companies specializing in the provision of data is currently before Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is not enough and that is why he has further developed his program, which would condition the transmission of data on the exclusive consent of the person concerned.
This is another question of whether the person concerned is really free to give his consent or not, since if he refuses, the insurance companies do not sign an insurance contract with him.
So, in the end, the hens depend on the benevolence of the fox.
The global menu of Marseille
The European Union and India are doubling their trade.
Since the European Union and India are very important trading partners for each other, this topic also dominated the agenda of this ninth summit alongside the other, largely global, issues.
Today, a France-India summit will also take place, where cooperation in the field of atomic energy will be discussed.
The European Union recognises that India is a major emerging democratic power that should be given a broader say in international affairs, but member countries have yet to agree on their support for New Delhi for its candidacy as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
They did not dwell too much on this issue, yesterday, at this 9th summit held in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as the current President of the Union, as well as the President of the Commission José Manuel Barroso and the head of diplomacy, Javier Solana, welcomed the Indian Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed that in five years they would double trade, which means an increase of a good hundred billion.
Taking into account that between 2000 and 2007, trade in goods rose from 25 billion to 55 billion, this does not seem to be an overly ambitious goal.
In this sense, they have legally harmonized the 26 bilateral agreements with India concerning civil flights, so that air traffic can also grow in the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the EU by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the negotiations.
The aim is to balance the situation with, on the one hand, India, which is the EU's largest trading partner, and, on the other, New Delhi, which is only ninth among the EU's partners.
The summit devoted its attention to global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan was strongly condemned, as was all forms of terrorism, and there was mention of the urgency of holding a United Nations conference on the subject.
The completion of the Doha trade cycle has also been called for, although both play a large part in the current failure.
The EU has confirmed that it remains committed to the energy and climate agenda, including that it would like to reduce its releases of toxic materials by at least 20 per cent by 2020.
India also agreed on this point, as well as on the need for a global market at the climate conference next year, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 per cent by 2050.
They would also like to prevent food prices from rising, and supported convening an international working meeting to discuss the financial crisis.
The Indian head of state is visiting the French capital today, where during a bilateral meeting, he is preparing to sign an agreement on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris, it is hoped that French companies will receive orders worth twenty billion euros for the construction of Indian atomic reactors.
According to the press agency, the agreement would last for 15 years.
In Frankfurt, more than three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than three hundred Italian publishers attended the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international event in the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair is waiting for this edition, more than 7 thousand exhibitors from 101 different countries who will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the Fair with more than 403 thousand titles on display, and Turkey as the guest of honor.
It will be the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities, Francesco Maria Giro, who will represent the Italian Government, at the inauguration ceremony of the Italian Butterfly: indeed, Italy will be present in an institutional way, with an Italy Point - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
It will be followed by the press meeting in the Room Struktur, at butterfly 5.0 of the Buchmesse: an opportunity to present the figures, trends and prospects on the position of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of foreign author books is gradually decreasing compared to the total of Italian production, and in particular, compared to that for adults and children.
Found the plane of Steve Fossett, the billionaire who disappeared a year ago.
The wreckage of the plane of Steve Fosset, the billionaire disappeared on September 3, 2007 while he was flying over the Nevada desert, has been found.
The debris was found on a plateau 3,000 meters above sea level, in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammonth Lakes, on the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, however, no human remains.
Madera County Sheriff John Anderson said: “The plane was located, we sent a team, and now we have confirmation that this is the one that Steve Fosset was travelling on the day he disappeared.”
The sheriff said no human remains were found on or near the plane.
In February, the 63-year-old billionaire was considered dead.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said that a few hours after the wreckage was located, a team of investigators sent to the scene identified the aircraft: it is the Bellanca 8kcab, disappeared on September 3, 2007, when Fosset took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the border of Nevada, some personal belongings of Fosset were found by a couple around their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents bearing the name of Fosset, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a sweater.
Fossett's search was halted a month after he disappeared.
The billionaire had earned a place in history thanks to a long series of records.
On the sixth attempt, he had become in 2002, the first man to complete the round the world on an aerostatic balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later, he had traveled around the world by plane and non-stop.
Among all these records, also that of having flown at 15,445 meters high, on the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the publicity you're not expecting.
An unusual 4x4 of an original and well-defined design, with marked lines, wide surfaces and sharp angles.
Here, in synthesis, Glk, the latest off-road "compact" of the house of the star, with which Mercedes-Benz has tried to give a wind of novelty in this sector.
Precisely because of its non-standard, unexpected and unconventional content will be the communication that will accompany the launch of the 4x4 Glk, available in Mercedes-Benz showrooms, from October 17th.
Thus the hype that will accompany the beginning of the new car will give rise to a new mode of communication, through a futuristic campaign of 3D displays, used for the first time in Italy by an automotive brand.
A project of maxi displays, articulated in three different phases, which will dominate the heart of Milanese shopping, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication provides for the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision, and thanks to special glasses distributed around Corso Como, it will be possible to see the new 4x4 in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, one will have the impression that looking at the image, the car comes out of the poster.
Then, through the use of the innovative Elimina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated according to the spots, in all its details, and then recompose into a single image.
It is obvious that with this advertising, Mercedes is trying to introduce something new into the stereotypical field of motoring communication.
Will it succeed with this formula to arouse the interest of future purchasers? We will see.
These are the Italian hooligans.
From the Triveneto, they risk the Daspo.
But who are these 150-200 young boys and girls that Italy is now ashamed of? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia" that follows the Italian national team for years, and which, until now, had never created big problems.
He had never been in contact with the opposing tifosi.
The extraction of the group is on the right.
The promoters come from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste, and Udine.
In Sofia, small groups (not really) from Campania and Puglia were added.
They had tricolor flags on which their city of origin appeared: Saturday night, they were all kidnapped so as not to be identified.
They are inspired by English typography.
In Bulgaria, they found a typhus of real Nazis, that of Levski.
The Figc had made available to the Italian tifosi, 144 tickets for the game: all registered, and therefore easily controllable.
And the Viminal had indeed controlled them all: among those who left for Sofia, none had a Daspo in progress, none had been banned from attending a stadium.
Four Italian tifosi who had a history of stadium crime, were not entitled to the ticket, and could not make the trip.
Now the Viminal is waiting to read the acts that will come from the Bulgarian police, and will then take action: in this case, it could be that the tifosi arrested or identified in the disorders serve a Daspo for at least five years.
An international Daspo that forbids to attend Italian stadiums, but also European ones.
In short, our hooligans will no longer set foot in the stadium.
Thankfully.
But now is the time of fear-emulation: that is to say, others may be added to the first one hundred and fifty.
"We must put out this fire immediately, and not legitimize who behaves like this," the Viminal said.
So, "keep your eyes open especially in view of Wednesday's national team match in Lecce"
In Puglia there is indeed a small nucleus of supporters of the Ultras Italy.
Tomorrow, the Observatory meets, Tuesday the Casms which can even count on a section of the Aise, that is to say the secret services, which deal precisely with the problems of the stadium.
"The Duce-Duce choirs, and the outstretched arm during Mameli's anthem? In Bulgaria, it's not a crime"
This is the opinion (expressed in a really unpleasant way) of Domenico Mazzilli, recently director of the Observatory of the Viminal (he took the position of Francesco Tagliente and then of Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was previously prefect in Trieste where a core group of supporters of Ultras Italy, founded in 2002, resides.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria, to praise Mussolini is not a crime, but it is certain that the behaviour of these 150-200 fans has been shameful.
"I am not a sociologist - adds the No. 1 of the Observatory - crimes must be attributed in the country in which the fact occurs.
Until now, this group had remained within the rules, now we will see what happened, and we will evaluate for the future.
But let’s also talk about the whistles to Mameli’s anthem: those too are not crimes, but if you’ll excuse me, they’re not polite...”
