Members of the Welsh Assembly (AM) are concerned about "looking like muppets"
Some Assembly Members are baffled by the suggestion that their title should be changed to Members of the Parliament of Wales (MWP).
This confusion arises from plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly from across the political spectrum are concerned that this may be ridiculed.
A Labour Party Assembly Member stated that his group was concerned "that it rhymed with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means fool and pwp means poop.
A Welsh Party Assembly Member commented that his whole group was "disgruntled" and has suggested alternatives.
A member of the Conservative Party of Wales claimed that his group was "open" to the name change, but noted that the pronunciation jump from MWP to muppet was small.
In this context, the pronunciation of the letter w in Welsh is similar to that of the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name change, states: “Of course, the final decision on any descriptive element of the name of the Assembly Members will be the affair of the members themselves.”
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Assembly of Wales the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation of the proposals which revealed broad support for calling the Welsh Parliament to the Assembly.
On the issue of the title of Members of the Assembly, the Commission preferred Members of the Parliament of Wales (or WMP), but the MWP option garnered most of the support in a public consultation.
Members of the Assembly appear to be suggesting alternative options, but the struggle to reach a consensus could bring Assembly Speaker Elin Jones to her head, who should send the bill on changes in a few weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes related to the functioning of the assembly, such as rules on disqualification of Assembly members and the design of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will have the final say in the question of what they should be called when deliberating on legislation.
Macedonians go to the polls to vote on a referendum on renaming the country
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether their country's name will be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was called in an attempt to resolve a decades-old conflict with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has always insisted that its northern neighbour’s name is a claim on its territory and has repeatedly opposed its bid to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonia’s President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the plebiscite on the name change, has said he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price that must be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin are silent because of the difficulties of the churches of Harlem
“Historically, the older people I’ve talked to say there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Mr. Adams says.
“Today, there is neither one nor the other.”
He noted that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“Now people socialize in a different way,” he says.
“Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhoods that neighbors go to regularly.”
With regard to churches, he worries that the money earned from the sale of goods will not last as long as leaders expect and that “sooner or later, they will return to the starting point.”
The churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings filled with the kind of people who won’t help the remaining sanctuaries in the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people,” he said, “and will therefore speed up the closing of these churches, as it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these apartments will end up being members of these churches.”
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
A black congregation worshipping nearby acquired the building.
A black congregation took the reins of St. Martin, under the direction of the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of merchants on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, who were reluctant to hire or promote black people.
In 1939, a fire left the building badly damaged and, while Father Johnson’s parishioners were making plans for its reconstruction, they also commissioned the carillon.
The Rev. David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson in St. Martin, proudly called it “the campaigns of the poor.”
In July, the expert who played the carillon called it “a cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument.”
In addition, the expert, Tiffany Ng, of the University of Michigan, noted that it was the first carillon in the world used by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who left to play the carillon of Riverside Church, larger, 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather commented that St. Martin did not replace him.
What has happened in St. Martin in recent months has been a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought in by lay church leaders and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parish board, the governing body of the parish, composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July commenting on its concern that the diocese would “attempt to pass the costs” to the board, although the board had not participated in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old boy scuba diving for lobsters in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving for lobsters in California the day lobster season opened, authorities said.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told San Diego-based KSWB-TV that he had been diving with friends for a half-hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy calling for help, so he approached with a group to pull him out of the water.
Hammel commented that, at first, he thought he was just excited about catching a lobster, but then he realized that "he was screaming that he'd been bitten.
,
His collarbone was shattered," Hammel observed as he reached the child.
"I called on everyone to get out of the water because there was a shark," Hammel said.
The boy was flown by helicopter to Rady Children’s Hospital, where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Rescuer Captain Larry Giles told a news conference that a shark had been sighted in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had not been considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim showed traumatic injuries in the upper torso area.
The authorities closed the access to the beach, from Ponto Beach, in Casablad, to Swami Beach, in Encinitas, for 48 hours to investigate and for security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans boost UK beauty market
Sainsbury's acquires Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, which have many employees specializing in the aisles of its style and beauty establishments.
In order to significantly boost the UK beauty market, valued at <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 trillion and with growth on the rise compared to falling sales in fashion and household goods, the largest beauty aisles will be tested in 11 stores across the country and, if successfully outperformed, the same will be done in more stores next year.
The investment in beauty comes at the same time that this supermarket chain is looking for ways to use the shelf space that used to be used for televisions, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury’s said it would double its beauty offering with up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
In addition, more space will be given to the existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, with areas similar to those of other establishments, such as Boots.
The chain will also relaunch its Boutique makeup range with a majority of animal-friendly products, something increasingly demanded by younger customers.
The Fragrance Shop will also test its concessions at two Sainsbury’s stores, the first just opened in Croydon, south London, last week, and the second will open at Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Online stores and the shift toward daily shopping for small amounts of food in local stores force supermarkets to strive to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, the chief executive of Sainsbury's, has said the stores will look more and more like shopping malls as the supermarket chain tries to combat discounters Aldi and Lidl by offering more non-food products and services.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos discount outlets into hundreds of stores and has introduced several Habitats since its purchase of these chains two years ago. This is considered to have boosted grocery sales and further monetized these acquisitions.
The supermarket chain’s previous attempt to revamp its beauty and pharmacy departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint operation with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended after a discussion about how to split revenue from pharmaceutical outlets in their supermarkets.
The new strategy follows the sale of Sainsbury’s 281 pharmaceutical stores to Celesio, which owns Lloyds Pharmacy, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
Lloyds will participate in the plan, adding an expanded range of luxury skincare brands, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Chief Commercial Officer at Sainsbury’s, said: “We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty aisles in ways that enhance the environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in a specialized staff who will be available to offer advice.
Our brand offering is designed to fit every need, and an attractive setting and convenient location make us an irresistible destination for beauty products, defying the old-fashioned way of shopping.”
Peter Jones 'furious' after Holly Willoughby breaks <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
Peter Jones, the star of Dragon's Den, went "furious" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby broke an 11 million pound deal with her lifestyle business line to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby does not have time to devote to the fashion and accessories brand Truly.
This business had compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning host announced she was leaving the business on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has enraged Peter Jones, the star of Dragon’s Den, by abandoning his lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on his extraordinary new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to the sources consulted, Jones was "furious" when the golden girl of television admitted that his new agreements, valued at up to 1.5 million pounds, did not leave time to devote to Truly, his brand of fashion and accessories, during a tense meeting held on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, in Buckinghamshire.
The business had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was shaping up to be a favourite to double Willoughby's fortune of about <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
While Willoughby, 37, announced he was leaving the business on Instagram, Jones was leaving Britain to go to one of his holiday homes.
As one source commented, "Truly was by far Holly's top priority.
It was going to be her long-term future, which would keep her going for the next two decades.
His decision to leave left everyone involved totally stunned.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to launch.
There’s a warehouse full of merchandise at Marlow headquarters, ready-to-sell products.”
Experts believe that the departure of the This Morning host, one of Britain’s most profitable stars, could cost the company millions due to significant investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing, and possibly further delaying its launch.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are parents to three children and have had a close relationship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby established Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The couples were vacationing together and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night "there was no talk of business issues."
A difficult conversation "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he receives from the media for making a comment that some would consider "unpresidential" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump commented with his mocking “newscaster” voice.
"I haven't given up anything."
He noted that Kim is interested in meeting with him again after Trump praised the first meeting held in June in Singapore, which he considered a big step toward denuclearizing North Korea.
However, negotiations for denuclearization have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, explained to world leaders gathered at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that his country does not see an “adequate response” from the US to the first steps towards North Korea’s disarmament.
On the contrary, he noted, the U.S. continues to apply sanctions in order to keep up the pressure.
Trump’s perspective was much more optimistic in the speech he gave during his rally.
“We get along great with North Korea,” he said.
“We were going to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We now have a fantastic relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results: an end to missile tests, help to free hostages and bring the remains of U.S. soldiers back home.
He also defended his unusual approach when talking about relations with Kim.
“It’s very easy to be presidential, but so instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this packed stadium, we’d have about 200 people right here,” Trump said, pointing to people standing right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate island, leaving hundreds dead
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that their assistance was not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of Lombok’s population had been displaced, no national emergency was declared, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they are not requesting international assistance, which complicates things a bit,” Ms. Sumbung explains.
Although Save the Children is preparing a team to send to Palu, they are still unsure whether foreign staff can work in the field.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the national emergency agency, said authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organisations were allowed to help.
Considering that the earth is constantly moving in Indonesia, the country remains incredibly unprepared when nature unleashes its wrath.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, not as many are seen in other coastal areas.
The apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, even though there was a previous warning, is likely to have contributed to the loss of life.
At best, travelling from one Indonesian island to another is a challenge.
Natural disasters further complicate logistics.
A hospital ship that was in Lombok to care for earthquake victims is heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the enclave of the new catastrophe.
President Joko Widodo has made improving Indonesia’s worn-out infrastructure the centerpiece of his election campaign, and has earmarked enough money for roads and rail lines.
However, the lack of funding has affected the administration of Mr. Joko, who faces re-election next year.
It must also address the pressure of persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands had to leave their homes as gangs of Christians and Muslims fought in the streets using machetes, bows and arrows, and other rudimentary weapons.
Watch this: Liverpool’s Daniel Sturridge equals the score against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea with an 89th-minute goal on Saturday at London’s Stamford Bridge.
Sturridge was given a pass by Xherdan Shaqiri just over 27 metres from Chelsea’s goal when the score was 1-0.
He put the ball on his left foot with one touch before throwing it to the second stick.
The action sent him over the area and headed towards the upper right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball passed over Kepa Arrizabalaga who tried to stop it with a jump and fell into the net.
“I was trying to put myself in that position to get the ball and players like Shaq always play very well ahead, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching and I gave him a touch. I didn't think about it too much, I just threw the shot."
Chelsea were winning 1-0 in the first half after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues midfielder made a heel pass to Mateo Kovacic on that play, before turning around doing a dribble near midfield and entering Liverpool's field.
Kovacic quickly passed the ball and ran out in midfield.
Afterward, he made a nice pass into space that brought Hazard into the area.
Hazard was in front of the defence and ended up throwing the ball into the net from the second post with a left kick that Liverpool’s Alisson Becker couldn’t stop.
On Wednesday at 3 p.m., Liverpool play Napoli in the Champions League group stage at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3pm in London.
Indonesia Tsunami Death toll rises to 832
The death toll from Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country’s emergency agency said early on Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the rubble of buildings that collapsed during Friday's 7.5-magnitude earthquake that unleashed waves of up to six meters, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said during a news conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with remains of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man as murder suspect after woman stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been opened after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with stabbings in Grayson Mews, on John Street, which led to the arrest of a 32-year-old man as a murder suspect.
Police have urged people in the area who have seen or heard something to go to the police.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is in the early stages, but I would encourage anyone who has been near John Street in Birkenhead and has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
In addition, I would recommend anyone, especially taxi drivers, who has been able to capture something on dashcam to contact us, as they may have vital information for our investigation."
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body has been found is from Birkenhead and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon some people who think they know the woman arrived at the crime scene to find out where they had found her this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and police have reported that they are in the process of informing relatives of the victim.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has tried to re-enter his flat, but police tell him no one can enter or leave the building.
He was puzzled when he found out what had happened.
Now, residents are informed that they will be allowed to re-enter in a few hours.
Someone overheard an officer telling a man that the entire area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared at the scene in tears.
He keeps saying, "It's terrible."
At two in the afternoon, there were two police vans inside the cordon and one more outside.
Several agents remained standing inside the cordon controlling the block of floors.
Anyone with information is asked to email DM <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, registration 247 of September 30.
Cromwell's Statue of Parliament Becomes Latest Commemorative Hit for 'Rewriting History'
Their prohibition would be an act of poetic justice for this Taliban-style destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious objects carried out by their fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Mr Crick's suggestions as "madness" and an "attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, commented: "In the current debate over the removal of statues, it was inevitable that removing Oliver Cromwell's figure from the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
The wrong Cromwell may be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor, Thomas, during the previous century.
The magnificent depiction of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft by Cromwell is a testament to 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many deem worthy of celebration.
As Mr Goldsmith pointed out to The Sunday Telegraph: "Many consider Cromwell, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than at present, an advocate of parliament in the face of external pressure, in this case, of course, the monarchy.
If this is a completely accurate description, it is a matter of continuing the historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century has shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure who represents a face of that divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration.”
Killer Pig Attacks Chinese Farmer
A pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwest China, according to local media.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan," was found dead with a severed artery covered in blood near a dump in Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
On 30 May 2005, a pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs in a pig pen in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door to a nearby pigsty was open.
He said there was a big pig in the pigsty with blood in its mouth.
The forensic examination confirmed that the pig of almost 250 kilos had attacked the farmer to death, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were bloodied and torn apart,” the cousin, who is referred to by his surname, “Wu,” told The Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told The Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while police collected evidence at the scene.
It appears that Yuan’s family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although they are rare, it is not the first time a pig has attacked a person.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their Massachusetts farm, leaving the man seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a pig of almost 295 kilos cornered a farmer on his tractor until his wife scared the animal away.
After pigs ate an Oregon rancher in 2012, a Manitoba rancher told CBC News that pigs aren’t usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a “trigger.”
“They’re just playing.
They are like children, very curious... their intention is not to hurt.
What we need to do is have the right respect for them,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will leave widespread heavy rains in the southwestern U.S.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the colder waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
However, Rosa will leave torrential rains across northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S. in the coming days.
Rosa caused wind gusts of more than 136 km/h, a category 1 hurricane, from Sunday at five in the morning (Eastern time) and was located almost 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, low pressures are beginning to build in the Pacific Ocean, moving eastward toward the U.S. West Coast. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday, a tropical storm will begin to drive intense northbound tropical rains toward the U.S. Southwest.
Rosa will leave more than 25 centimeters of rain in some areas of Mexico on Monday.
Finally, when tropical rain hits with approaching low pressure, there will be widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, between 2 and 10 centimeters of rain will cause dangerous flash floods, debris flows and possible landslides in the desert.
The intense tropical rains will cause rainfall of almost 5 to 8 centimeters per hour in specific areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Between 5 and 10 centimeters of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Due to the dispersed nature of tropical rains, flash floods may occur with rapidly worsening conditions.
For this threat of torrential tropical rains, it is not recommended at all to venture into the desert on foot.
Heavy rains could turn the canyons into raging rivers and storms will cause gusty winds and dust clouds locally.
The approaching low pressures will leave heavy rains in specific parts of the Southern California coast.
Torrential rains may leave up to almost two centimeters of water, which could cause small flows of debris and make roads slippery.
It would be the first torrential rains in the region during the wet season.
Some scattered tropical showers will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early Monday, before rain becomes widespread late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will extend to the Four Corners on Tuesday and throughout Wednesday.
In October, some intense temperature changes can be observed in the U.S. due to the cooling of the Arctic and the warmth of the tropics.
Sometimes, this involves drastic changes in temperature over short distances.
A good example of these temperature differences is what will happen across the central U.S. on Sunday.
There will be a nearly 7-degree difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the prolonged summer heat will try to recover and re-expand.
In much of the central and eastern U.S., a warm start to October is expected, with widespread temperatures hovering around 26 degrees from the Southern Plains to parts of the northeast.
On Tuesday, temperatures in New York could reach up to 26 degrees, about 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast indicates high odds of above-average temperatures for the eastern U.S. during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s appearance
More than 20 million people followed the harrowing testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault allegedly committed in the 1980s, on Thursday on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the policy remained stalled and the media interrupted its usual schedule to broadcast the latest news on Friday: an agreement designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Blake for the FBI to conduct an investigation of the allegations for a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he is absolutely certain Kavanaugh groped her in a drunken state and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
During his impassioned testimony, Kavanaugh said he was absolutely certain that had not happened.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people who commented Nielsen on Friday have seen it.
The company accounted for the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available to other channels that rebroadcast it, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen usually has some trouble figuring out how many people see something in the office.
To put it in perspective, it is an audience similar to that of a playoff football game or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose pollsters have strongly supported Kavanaugh’s designation, was the lead channel, averaging 5.69 million viewers during an all-day appearance, Nielsen said.
ABC took second place, with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
After the hearing, there was still a great deal of interest.
Flake was the central character in Friday’s drama.
After the moderate Republican’s office issued a statement saying it would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning caught protesters shouting at him as he tried to get into an elevator to attend an appearance before the Judiciary Committee.
While receiving these reproaches, broadcast live on CNN, he was dejected.
"Looking me in the face," one woman said.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
He continued, “You have power when there are so many women who don’t.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement and, before the elevator doors closed, that he would say more in his appearance before the Commission.
The cable and broadcast networks broadcast it all live hours later, when the Judiciary Committee had to vote to propose Kavanaugh’s Senate candidacy for a vote.
However, Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations made against the candidate over the next week, which some Democrats had been calling for.
Flake was convinced, in part, by the conversations he had had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators subsequently, Flake made his decision.
Flake’s decision was critical, as it was clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without that investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of ‘doing politics’ with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of “doing politics” with Britain’s future and undermining the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Congress to be held in Birmingham (Britain) on September 29, 2018.
In another interview published alongside his on the front page of the newspaper, his former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, insisted on his attack on Chequers’ supposed Brexit plan, claiming that a proposal for Britain and the EU to levy tariffs on each other was “totally absurd.”
Wayde Murder: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson as Suspect in LSU Player's Death
Police have arrested a suspect in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player, during a shooting.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and jailed on a second-degree murder charge, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police say Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses at the crime scene and said they had found Simpson’s DNA on them, CBS affiliate WAFB reports.
After questioning Simpson, police say he admitted shooting Wayde.
A bond of $350,000 has been set, according to the defense.
The Baton Rouge East District Court of Instruction released a preliminary report Friday that said the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the back of the head.
The department recognizes the merits of the Louisiana State Police fugitive unit, the State Police crime lab, Southern University police, and citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU’s sporting director, thanked police forces in the area for their “diligence and pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The player, who was more than two meters tall, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in a game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said his team is "devastated" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
“These are the things that people always worry about,” Wade said.
A volcano spews ash in Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached neighborhoods south of Mexico’s capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the crater showed activity and recorded 183 emissions of gas and ash in 24 hours.
The center recorded several tremors and shakes.
On social media, the images showed thin layers of ash coating the windshields of vehicles in Mexico City neighborhoods, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed increased activity at the volcano, located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of anniversary of independence referendum
Six people were arrested on Saturday in Barcelona after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police as thousands took part in opposition rallies marking the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarised referendum on secession.
A group of hooded separatists who had been cut off by riot police threw eggs and powder paint at them, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets, which are normally filled with tourists.
Clashes also erupted in the following hours and police used batons to contain the fight.
For several hours, the pro-independence groups, with messages such as "neither forgetting nor forgiving", confronted unionist demonstrators to the cry of "Viva Espa<0xC3><0xB1>a".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests, according to local media.
Tensions remain high in this region a year after the October 1 vote, considered illegal by Madrid but held by separatist Catalans.
Voters overwhelmingly chose independence, although turnout was low, as people who were against secession largely boycotted the referendum.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police attempted to block voting at polling stations across the region, where violent clashes took place.
Pro-independence groups camped out on Friday night to avoid a rally in support of the National Police.
The demonstration went ahead, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician attending the separatist protest with his wife said he no longer had any hope of Catalonia becoming independent.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry for joy at being able to vote, but now we’re stuck,” she said.
Despite achieving a vital, if narrow, victory in last December’s regional elections, pro-Catalan parties have struggled to retain momentum this year, as many of their best-known leaders, whether in self-imposed exile or detained, are awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of police on his phone, said the conflict had been stoked by politicians on both sides.
“It’s getting more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since late last year, announced he would participate in next year’s European Parliament elections.
“Being a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression we have seen of the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: men arrested for ramming a house with a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after repeatedly ramming into a Londonderry home with a car.
The incident occurred on Thursday around 7:30 p.m. at Ballynagard Crescent.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage was caused to the entrances and the building itself.
At some point, he may have shot himself into the car with a crossbow.
Menga's attack gives Livingston a 1-0 win against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the win
A promoted Livingston impressed the Rangers by taking the second loss to Steven Gerrard in 18 games as Ibrox club coach.
Dolly Menga's attack made all the difference as Gary Holt's went up one place, with Hibernian in second place.
This season, Gerrard’s side have yet to win away from home and next Sunday they face the Hearts, leaders of the table with an eight-point lead.
Previously, the Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Europa League.
Livingston, meanwhile, are extending their division winning streak to six games, and head coach Holt has yet to relish the loss since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses opportunities in front of hard-hitting visitor
Holt’s team had to have gone a step ahead long before scoring, causing all sorts of trouble for the Rangers for their straight play.
Scott Robinson overtook the defense, but missed his attempt in front of the goal, and Alan Lithgow was deflected after going inside to finish off Craig Halkett's center of the head in front of the goal.
The host team was content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause problems for the visitors with the ball being stopped.
That’s how the decisive goal came.
The Rangers gave them a free kick and Livingston looked for an inning, with a combined play from Declan Gallagher and Robinson for Menga, who hit the ball and scored from the center of the area.
At the time, the Rangers dominated possession, but could not get past the host's defense and the goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, was quite calm.
That game continued until the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a stop by Kelly.
Rangers goaltender Allan McGregor rejected Scott Pittman's shot with a kick, and Lithgow was far from another Livingston play.
Two penalty requests were rejected, one after Halkett's inning over backup Glenn Middleton and one for a hand, and the other after Halkett's inning over his right-hander Glenn Middleton.
Livingston's "phenomenal" (analysis)
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Stadium
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
The unanimous opinion is that they made an excellent game that continued to exceed expectations of an upward trajectory.
His playing style and squad have hardly undergone any changes since his promotion, but this is largely due to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
I had a lot of heroes.
Halkett, the team captain, was huge and led a superbly organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on alert at all times.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they had very good moments with Gerrard, they fell short.
They failed to materialize the plays, as they only managed to get into the opposite field once, which is a wake-up call to the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan has received an ambiguous reception in Cologne
On Saturday 29 September there were smiles and a blue sky during the breakfast of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They have discussed issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to inaugurate a huge new mosque.
The city hosts the largest population of Turks outside of Turkey.
Police claimed security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters gathered nearby to see its president.
Hundreds of Erdogan’s opponents, many of them Kurds, were also heard condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him to the country.
These demonstrations reflect how divisive this visitor is, received as a hero by some German Turks and considered an autocrat by others.
Traffic accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies after colliding with a vehicle
A cyclist has died in a car accident in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwookd Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road from Deptford, southeast of the city, at about 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was taken care of by paramedics, but he died right there.
The crash comes after another cyclist was killed after being run over by a vehicle that escaped on Childers Street, nearly two kilometers from the scene of Saturday’s crash.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Roads have been cut and buses diverted, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Officers Injured After Riots
Six prison officials have been injured in an altercation at a high-security prison for men, according to the Prison Management.
The riots started at Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. on Sunday and are still going on.
Specialists of an elite team (called "Tornado") are in charge of controlling the altercations, in which eight inmates participate and which affect a ward.
Officers received assistance for minor injuries to the face at the scene.
A prison service spokesman comments: “Specialized prison staff have been deployed to deal with the ongoing incident at Long Lartin Prison.
Six staff members have received health care for injuries.
Violence is not tolerated in our prisons and we make it clear that those responsible will be put in the hands of the police and could spend more time behind bars.”
Long Lartin Prison is home to more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had received hospital medical assistance after an inmate attacked him.
In addition, in October last year riot police were asked to come to the prison to deal with a serious altercation in which prison staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flash flooding (dry areas could benefit)
It’s unusual for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that’s exactly what could happen early next week when Hurricane Rosa’s final bouts cross the desert’s southwest, at risk of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood alerts for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada and southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, leaving rain by the end of Monday.
The Phoenix National Weather Service said in a tweet that only "ten hurricanes have retained their tropical storm or depression status within a 321 kilometer radius of Phoenix since 1950.
In 1967, Hurricane Katrina approached nearly 40 miles from the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict between 5 and 10 centimeters of torrential rain, which can reach 15 centimeters in isolated areas of the Mogoll<0xC3><0xB3>n Escarpment, in Arizona.
It is likely that between 2 and 5 centimeters of rain will fall, with the possibility of reaching 10 in isolated places, in other areas of the southwest of the desert, including the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin.
In places that are not at risk of flash flooding, the Rosa rains can be considered a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious matter, some of these torrential rains are likely to be beneficial due to the drought conditions currently being experienced in the southwest.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second-highest category, as reported on weather.com.
First of all, the route of Hurricane Rosa will hit the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, which on Sunday morning will still have a hurricane force with maximum gusts of 136 kilometers per hour, is 619 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and is moving north at 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm is finding cooler waters in the Pacific, so it is losing strength.
Thus, it is expected to land in Mexico with the intensity of a tropical storm throughout Monday afternoon.
Heavy torrential rains could fall in some parts of Mexico, which are at considerable risk of flooding.
"A torrential rain of between 7 and 15 centimeters is expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with the possibility of reaching 25 centimeters," as reported on weather.com.
Rosa will then head north from Mexico as a tropical storm, before arriving at the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression.
"The main danger to Rosa or her remains is heavy torrential rain in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern U.S. desert," the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to cause dangerous flash floods and debris flows in deserts, as well as landslides in mountain areas.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: Four Arrests for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after another 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the area of Excelsior Terrace, in Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital, where he remains "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old were arrested that same night in the Radstock area of Avon, according to Somerset Police.
The agents have appealed to anyone who may have recorded what happened with the mobile.
Trump says Kavanaugh "suffered the pettiness and anger" of the Democratic Party
“To vote for Judge Kavanaugh is to vote to reject the Democratic Party’s ruthless and outrageous tactics,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has "suffered the pettiness and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation that she had sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on this charge.
On Saturday, the president said that, on that day, “Americans saw Kavanaugh’s cunning, quality and bravery.”
"To vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is to vote to confirm one of the most accomplished legalists of our day, a jurist with an admirable record of service to the public," he told supporters in West Virginia.
The president made indirect references to Kavanaugh’s candidacy by talking about the importance of Republican participation in midterm elections.
“Five weeks to one of the most important choices of our lives.
I’m not running, but it’s a race,” he said.
“That’s why I go from one place to another fighting to get great candidates.”
Trump claimed the Democrats are engaged in a “resistance and obstruction” mission.
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh’s appointment is expected to be held no later than Friday, a senior Republican leadership official told CNN.
Hundreds Killed in Indonesia Earthquake and Tsunami, Number on the Rise
At least 384 people have died and many have been washed up by huge waves ravaging beaches after a strong earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered to celebrate a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when waves of up to six meters reached the coast at dusk, dragging many to their deaths and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami came after a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"When a tsunami was warned yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not immediately flee, so they were victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), told a news conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, it dragged cars, logs, houses, it ravaged everything on land,” Nugroho said. The tsunami had moved through the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
He added that some people had climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the agency showed the destruction of many buildings and shops, broken and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
The Agency for Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday’s big earthquake was 200 times higher than that of the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima in World War II.
He added that the geography of the city, which sits at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have magnified the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "significant" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He said bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, with 540 people injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said the toll and damage could be higher along the 300 km of coastline north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the quake's epicenter.
The communications "were totally paralyzed and there was no information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
"There live more than 300,000 people," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy in itself, but it could be much worse,” he said.
On Saturday, the agency received much criticism for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials say the waves had already reached the coast when the alert was issued.
In a recording captured by an amateur and shared on social media, a man was heard on the top floor of a building warning people on the street that a tsunami was approaching.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the shore, carrying buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately validate the material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major blackout that cut off communications in and around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue work.
The army began sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, authorities say, but evacuees still need food and other basic goods.
The city’s airport has been reopened for relief work only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has a scheduled visit to Paul’s evacuation centers on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami is over 800.
It's a very bad thing.
Although World Vision staff from Donggala have arrived safely in the city of Palu, where employees take refuge under tarpaulins installed in the garden of their offices, they have seen a devastating panorama on their way, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they had seen a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
It's a very bad thing.
Even as aid groups set the wheels of disaster relief in motion, some people lamented that well-experienced aid workers were not being allowed to move to Palu.
Under Indonesian law, foreign funding, supplies and staffing can only be used if the affected site is declared a national disaster area.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a catastrophe at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a Red Cross spokesman in Indonesia.
“As soon as the government says it considers it a national disaster, we can start providing international aid, but it hasn’t happened yet.”
As the second night in Palu fell after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and family members of people who were still missing were still hopeful that their loved ones would be miracles that would bring some light to the bleak stories written by natural catastrophes.
On Saturday, a small boy was pulled out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, an instructor for Indonesia’s national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which concluded earlier that month in Indonesia.
Others who were trapped in the Roa Roa hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
“From my experience in the field of paragliding, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon recalled how, in the hours following the release of the news that the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed in the paragliding community, he had sent desperate WhatsApp messages to Palu’s competitors, who were participating in the festival being held on the beach.
However, their messages only showed one check mark in gray, not two in blue.
“I think that means the messages weren’t delivered,” he said.
Thieves Take $26,750 During ATM Reload in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves robbed a Brink employee charging an ATM in Newport on the Levee, taking $26,750, according to a Newport Police Department press release.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied an ATM located in the entertainment center and was preparing to recharge it with more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the note.
While he was busy, another man “ran up behind Brink’s employee” and stole a bag of money destined for recharging.
According to the note, there are witnesses who saw several suspects leaving the scene, but police did not specify the number of those involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is going to be called Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday: “The person formerly known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, has long been nicknamed Ye, the name he used as the title for his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes ahead of her appearance on Saturday Night Live, where she is expected to present her new album, Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande, who had to cancel her performance for "emotional reasons," as the show's creator commented.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had previously said that the word had religious significance to him.
“I think it’s the most used word in the Bible, where it means ‘you,’” West said earlier this year while discussing the album’s title with radio announcer Big Boy.
"It's you, it's us, it means us.
She went from being Kanye, which means ‘the one’, to Ye, a reflection of our good, bad and confusing things, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of the many famous rappers who has changed his name.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, JAY-Z, has used his name in uppercase or lowercase, with or without a script.
AMLO vows not to use army against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use the military against the civilian population as the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students in the country approaches.
On Saturday, L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador promised at Plaza Tlatelolco that he would “never use the army to repress the people of Mexico.”
On October 2, 1968, troops fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were taking hold across Latin America.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador is committed to supporting young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to those who study and opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and a lack of educational opportunities led young people to join criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double I.A. funding.
Now that China is more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its investment in AI research, says Kai-Fu Lee, an I.A. investor and professional who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow A.I.-related announcements from various parts of the U.S. government, even when, in general, the U.S. lacks an official A.I. strategy.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: its goal is to become the No. 1 in innovation in AI by 2030.
"Double the budget for A.I. research would be a good start, given that all other countries lag far behind the U.S. We have our sights set on the next breakthrough in the field of A.I.," Lee says.
Twice the funding means twice the chance that the next great achievement in A.I. will be achieved in the U.S., as Lee stated in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s leading A.I. companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an A.I. system that beat Othello's best American player. He was later an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's subsidiary in China.
Lee recognized previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be, which would identify the next generation of visionaries.
In the U.S., researchers often have to work hard to get government grants, Lee said.
“It’s not China that’s taking the academic leaders; it’s the corporations,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired prominent individuals from universities to work at I.A.
Lee said changes to immigration policy could also help the U.S. step up its I.A. initiatives.
“I think that I.A. doctors should have permanent residency cards automatically,” he said.
The State Council of China presented its Plan for the Development of the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation funds people from academic institutions just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations fund U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to attract partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the National Science Foundation, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in I.A.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that sought to create a National Artificial Intelligence Security Commission has not taken any action in months.
Macedonians have decided in a referendum on whether they will change the name of their country
The people of Macedonia decided in a referendum on Sunday whether their name would change to "Republic of North Macedonia," a gesture that would resolve a decades-old conflict with Greece, which had blocked their bid to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim on its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, both governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic population, mostly in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has questioned whether turnout will reach the minimum 50% required for the referendum to be considered valid.
The referendum ballot asked the following question: "Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying for Macedonia, one of the countries emerging from the breakup of Yugoslavia, to try to gain access to bodies like the EU and NATO.
"Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because this means a safer life for everyone," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it will not be legally binding, quite a few Members of Parliament have said that they will respect the result of the vote to make it decisive.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that, at 1 p.m., no irregularities had been reported.
However, turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% of the last parliamentary elections held in 2016, when 66% of registered voters cast their vote.
"I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who was voting in the capital Skopje.
Zoran Zaev, prime minister of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and son Dushko cast their vote in Macedonia’s referendum on a name change of the country that would pave the way for joining NATO and the European Union in Strumica (Macedonia) on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage and removing chairs in front of the tents planted by those who were going to boycott the referendum.
“We are in favor of entering NATO and the EU, but we want to do it with our heads held high, not through the back door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want us to enter as Macedonia, we can establish relations with other countries, such as China and Russia, and be part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says joining NATO would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I think the vast majority will be in favour, as more than 80% of citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said a positive outcome would be a “confirmation of our future.”
In a poll published on Monday by the Policy Research Institute, it was stated that between 30 and 43% of voters were going to participate in the referendum, which is a lower turnout than required.
Another poll conducted by Macedonia’s Telma TV revealed that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote in favour.
In order for the referendum to be considered a success, the turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
Should it fail, it would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since it came to power in May last year.
Watch this: Manchester City's Sergio Ag<0xC3><0xBC>ero dodges all of Brighton's defence to score a goal
Sergio Ag<0xC3><0xBC>ero and Raheem Sterling broke Brighton's defence in Manchester City's 2-0 victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
For Ag<0xC3><0xBC>ero, it was ridiculously easy to score a goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine midfielder received a pass in the midfield at the beginning of the play.
He ran between three Brighton defences before heading into the open.
Once there, he found himself surrounded by four green T-shirts.
He dodged a defense before overtaking several more on the edge of the Brighton area.
He made a pass to the left, where Sterling was.
The English striker used his first touch in the area to return the ball to Ag<0xC3><0xBC>ero, who hit him with his right foot to avoid goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot that reached the right side of the net.
"Aguero has some foot problems," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We talked about playing between 55 and 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at the time.”
However, it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the lead in the Premier League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
In that play, Aguero received the ball well within Brighton’s territory.
He made a nice pass on the left flank for Leroy Sane.
Sane gave him a few taps before directing Sterling toward the second stick.
The Sky Blues forward threw the ball into the net just before he went out of bounds.
City face Hoffenheim in a Champions League group game on Tuesday at 12:55 at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim (Germany).
Scherzer wants to spoil the party for the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the playoffs, there was no reason to force another start.
Still, the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to hit the mound Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if they triumphed against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West Division do they still have playoff opportunities.
The Rockies secured at least one wildcard spot thanks to a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still chasing their first division title.
“Although we don’t play anything, at least we can step on the rubber with the certainty that the Denver crowd will be excited and that the other team will probably play at the highest level I’ve faced this year.
Why wouldn’t you want to participate?”
The Nationals have yet to announce a starter for Sunday, but they seem inclined to let Scherzer pitch in that situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, made a practice session on Thursday and will return to his normal rest on Sunday.
Washington’s right-hander record is 18 wins and 7 losses, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts with 2/3 in 220 innings.
Trump holds rally in West Virginia
The president made indirect references to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, his Supreme Court selection, by talking about the importance of Republican participation in midterm elections.
“In November, everything we’ve done is at stake.
Five weeks to one of the most important choices of our lives.
It's one of the most important ones, I don't run, but it's a race, so I go from one place to another fighting to get great candidates," he said.
He continued, “We have this terrible radical group of Democrats, it’s happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by all necessary means, you see pettiness, evil.
They don’t care who they hurt or who they have to go over to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, and we’re not going to give it to them.”
The Democrats, he said, are on a “resistance and obstruction” mission.
“We’ve seen it these last four days,” he said, saying Democrats “were angry, they were bad, horrible and fake.”
He made reference to the Senate Judiciary Committee by naming Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who received boos from the public.
“Do you remember his answer?
Do you filter the document?
Mmm, Mmm, what?
No, no mmm, I expect an answer. His body language was terrible, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party already embraces a wide range of views.
He is intolerant of people who say what they think.
When Momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I am the last in a row of Labour MPs who are told they are not welcome, and just for saying what we think.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, received similar treatment being categorically against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the no-confidence motion criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
I disagreed with the importance of a responsible economic policy, in terms of national security, on Europe. It is ironic that they were matters in which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
As stated in the notice of Friday’s Nottingham East Labour Party meeting, “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of the eight years I have been a Member of Parliament for the local Labour Party, that is exactly what the Friday evening meetings of the General Committee have been.
Unfortunately, this is not the current tone of many meetings and the promise of a "kinder and kinder" policy is already more than forgotten, if it was actually applied at any point.
It is becoming increasingly clear that dissenting opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged on whether the party leaders find it acceptable or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom he previously thought he shared a similar political vision began to expect him to radically change his mind and adopt positions he would never have agreed with, either on national security or on the EU’s single market.
Whenever I speak in public, regardless of what I say, there is a tirade of insults on social media demanding my withdrawal, denouncing the policies of the centre, telling me that I should not be in the Labour Party.
I'm not the only one who's experienced it.
Indeed, I know that I am luckier than some of my colleagues, as comments about me tend to be political.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist insults on a daily basis, but never run away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of insults.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer have that wide range of opinions and, with every “no-confidence” motion or every change in the selection rules, the party becomes narrower.
In the last two years, I have received a lot of advice that recommended me to keep my head down and not make myself heard so much that I would be "okay".
But I didn’t get into politics to do that.
Since joining the Labour Party as a high school student 32 years ago, motivated by the negligence of the Thatcher government that left my comprehensive school classroom literally in ruins, I have tried to support the improvement of public services for those who need them most, whether as a councillor or as a government minister.
I have never hidden my political ideas, not even in the last election.
It is impossible for anyone in Nottingham East to be unaware of my political positions or the areas in which I disagreed with current leaders.
The only thing I would say to those who promoted Friday’s motion is that I do not understand this desire to waste time and energy with questions about my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party when the country goes head to head to a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and public services.
The real message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for voters, whether Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of withdrawal or political opportunism will prevent me from acting on what I believe is best for all of you.

Ayr 38 - Melrose 17: an undefeated Ayr climbs to the top
Two rehearsals at the end of the match may have decided the final result to some extent, but Ayr certainly deserved the win in this entertaining match of the day of the Tennent's Premiership.
They now top the table and are the only undefeated team of the ten participating.
In the end, it was the superiority of his defense, as well as his ability to better take advantage of the opportunities, that gave the home team victory, so coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
“We’ve been tested in every game and we’re still undefeated, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose commented: "Ayr deserves the recognition, they took advantage of the opportunities better than we did."
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute try, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead; but a yellow card to Scottish captain Rory Hughes, on loan from the Warriors for the game, allowed Melrose to take advantage of this disadvantage from the opponent and Jason Baggot got an unconverted try.
Climo extended Ayr's lead with a penalty, and earlier, just at halftime, he scored and converted a solo practice, leaving the score at 17-5 in Ayr's favour at halftime.
However, the Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's practice, converted by Baggot, reduced this gap to five points.
Then there was a long interruption due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, whom they had to take off on the stretcher, and, when the match resumed, Ayr came forward with a rehearsal by Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
The yellow card to Blair Macpherson, captain of the Ayr, allowed the Melrose to take advantage again that they had one more man with an unconverted rehearsal of Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of enormous pressure.
However, the locals recovered and, when the yellow card was shown to Struan Hutchinson for pinning Climo without the ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson rehearsed when he was in the back of the advancing maul.
Climo converted him, as he had been doing almost since the game resumed, after Kyle Rowe received the ball sent by David Armstrong from a kick and sent winger Gregor Henry to the back to take the fifth practice of the locals.
The protagonist of Still Game wants to orient his career towards the catering sector
Ford Kieran, star of Still Game, seems determined to move into the restaurant sector after it is revealed that he has been appointed director of a restaurant chain.
The 56-year-old actor is Jack Jarvis on the famous BBC show, who writes and co-stars with his longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the ninth season will be the last of the series, and it looks like Kiernan is making plans for her life after Craiglang.
According to the official record, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the matter, though a Scottish Sun source said Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "flourishing catering market".
"The sea belongs to us": a landlocked Bolivia has the hope that the court will reopen the route to the Pacific
Sailors guard a naval headquarters in La Paz.
Navy blue flags fly in public buildings.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, naval bases display the motto: "The sea belongs to us by right,
Getting it back is a duty.”
Throughout Bolivia, a land without sea, they still vividly remember the coast lost to Chile in a bloody conflict over resources that took place in the 19th century, in addition to the longing to sail back to the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may be the highest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the International Court of Justice by October 1, after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, is waiting for the result with a positive outlook," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the International Court of Justice’s ruling on big screens across the country, hoping that the Hague court will rule in favor of Bolivia’s claim that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile has an obligation to negotiate to grant Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president, who is waging a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has a lot to say about Monday’s resolution.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised in late August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in favor of Bolivia and that the situation would change little if it did.
The UN body based in the Netherlands has no power to award Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice’s ruling comes just six months after the closing arguments indicates that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
Far from promoting Bolivia’s cause, the last four years may have hindered it.
“The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration,” Zárate said.
In addition, he suggested that Morales’ belligerent rhetoric has undermined any residual Chilean goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold talks after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision-making was unusually quick.
On Monday, Bolivia will be offered "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and the possibility of "ending 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, used the maritime issue as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he said.
“The resolution is an opportunity to see that we have to leave the past behind.”
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless it can trust the U.S.
Ri Yong Ho, North Korea’s foreign minister, says his nation will never be the first to carry out nuclear disarmament if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to live up to promises made during a summit held in Singapore between rival leaders.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears poised to resume stalled diplomatic nuclear talks more than three months after the summit with North Korea’s leader Kim Jong U.
Ri points out that continued continued sanctions and U.S. opposition to a declaration ending the Korean War to subdue the North, is a “chimera.”
Washington is wary of accepting the statement without Pyongyang making any significant disarmament moves first.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to hold another summit.
However, there is widespread scepticism about Pyongyang’s seriousness in giving up an arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo is scheduled to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for another summit between the leaders.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest line of huge hats that are about to land on a shopping street near you
If you want to increase your hat collection or protect yourself completely from the sun, look no further.
The designers of Valentino and Thom Browne presented a set of eccentric oversized hats for their spring summer 2019 collection on the catwalk, dazzling the style of Paris Fashion Week.
Impossible hats have flooded Instagram this summer and these designers have brought their spectacular creations to the catwalk.
Valentino’s most outstanding piece was a beige hat with a wide wing adorned with feathers that wrapped the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories were watermelons with jewelry, a witch hat, and even a pineapple, but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of quirky masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had lips sewn together and were more reminiscent of Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation resembled a full scuba gear, snorkel and goggles included, while another looked like a melted ice cream cone.
If you like oversized fashion, you're in luck.
Style hunters predict that huge hats could start to be seen on store streets.
The big hats arrive stepping hard on the hand of "The Bomb", with a straw hat with a wing of more than 60 centimeters worn by all, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind this so impractical hat that flooded social networks presented another great creation on the runway: a straw beach bag as large as the swimsuit model that wore it.
The dark orange raffia bag, decorated with raffia fringes and with a white leather handle, was the main piece of Jacquemus’ La Riviera collection for the spring-summer 2019 season at Paris Fashion Week.
As celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "Next summer, I expect to see huge hats and beach bags on the shopping streets. Since the designer has had a big impact, it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are fundamental for the citizens of the world
Scotland’s independent schools have a track record of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another set of extraordinary test results that is reinforced by individual and collective successes in the fields of sport, art, music and other community projects.
With more than 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these centres, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to deliver the best level of service to pupils and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for higher education, for the career of their choice and for their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement an adapted curriculum, it is noted that modern languages remain a popular and desired subject in centers.
As Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, the message comes to his head.
If you speak to him in his tongue, it reaches his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that if you want to build relationships and build trust with people from other countries, you can’t rely solely on English.
If we take into account the recent results of this year’s exams, we can see that languages are at the top of the ranking tables, with the highest pass rates in independent schools.
In total, 68% of students who studied foreign languages obtained an A, the highest grade.
The data, collected from the 74 centers that are part of the SCIS, showed that 72% of students obtained an A in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish also obtained an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a fundamental skill that both children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
At present, it is considered that, as a subject, languages are at the same level as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and everywhere.
A survey carried out in 2014 by the UK’s Employment and Skills Commission revealed that, of the reasons given by employers for the difficulties they faced in filling jobs, 17% were attributed to a shortage of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly indispensable to prepare young people for their future careers.
Potential job opportunities requiring languages are on the rise, so these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of which career someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real edge in the future thanks to a competition like this, which will last a lifetime.
Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will allow that person to automatically get ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75% of them did not speak any foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, and the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage, 15%, was French.
For this reason, investing in language teaching is now important for today’s children.
If they know several languages, especially those in developing economies, children will be equipped to have better opportunities to find quality employment.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some centres will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach the languages considered most important to the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of a child, in independent schools you can always choose between several languages taught by teaching staff specialized in this subject.
Independent schools in Scotland are dedicated to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future holds.
At the moment, it is undeniable that, in a global business environment, languages continue to be of vital importance for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages must be considered "competences for international communication".
Independent schools will continue to offer these choices, diversity and excellence to Scotland’s young people.
It has to be done.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron makes Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego
Fans hoping to see LeBron James debut in his first game with the Los Angeles Lakers are about to end.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it remains to be determined how many minutes he will play.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James was likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After a training session earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers’ six-game preseason program.
"At this stage of my career I don't need pre-season games to prepare," he said.
Time for Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It’s the first of Trump’s five rallies scheduled for next week, including stops at places with supporters, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With his candidate’s confirmation vote to fill the pending Supreme Court vacancy, Trump aims to garner support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when votes are cast in November.
What time is Trump’s rally in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. tonight, Saturday, Sept. 29, 2018.
You can watch it online via a live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on this week’s appearances by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who have been strained over allegations of sexual misconduct and have put on hold an anticipated Senate confirmation vote for at most a week as the FBI investigates them.
However, the main goal of this series of rallies is to help Republicans facing the November election gain momentum.
President Trump’s campaign said next week’s five rallies are meant to “encourage volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majorities they retain in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Congress control is so crucial to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we go into campaigning,” a Trump campaign spokesman who declined to be named told Reuters.
Scheduled at Wheeling's Wesbanco Arena, tonight's rally could draw supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as get coverage in the Pittsburgh media," the West Virginia Metro News reported.
Saturday will mark the second time in a month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state in which he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, who is falling behind in the polls.
"For Morrisey, it's not a good sign that the president has to come and give him a boost in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows they dare to fight to keep hope alive ahead of Sunday’s individual games.
After three one-on-one sessions, the Saturday afternoon foursomes may be what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging impulse pendulum is a completely invented sports concept, but players really believe in it, even more so in competitions like these.
So where would you say the momentum is now?
“We were six points ahead and now we’re four points ahead, so I guess that can be considered a small boost,” Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course: four points ahead with twelve more at stake.
As Spieth points out, Americans feel they have some headwind and plenty of reasons to be excited, including the pair of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and scored three points out of four each.
Spieth has been lethal from tee to green and leads by example.
The celebratory guttural screams grew louder as their round progressed, introducing a vital putt to tie the fourth game as he and Thomas went two down after two holes.
The putt that gave them the game in the 15th was received with a similar cry, of those who transmit that he believes that the American team has not yet been left out.
"We have to redouble our efforts and concentrate on the game," Spieth said.
That’s what these players have done.
18 holes to make a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
The strange and adorable couple from Europe is four out of four and nothing can go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only pair that didn't do a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided the bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the final nine holes on Friday morning.
That streak and the way it flows its energy with the boisterous crowd makes it clear that these are the players to beat on Sunday, and that there won’t be other players as popular as Fleetwood and Molinari to seal a possible European win when the sun goes down at Le Golf National.
Preferably, both at the same time in different holes.
Even so, it is still premature to speak of European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson dispatched Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning four-ball, after teaming up with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole from which they could not get out.
But on Sunday there will be no help to get out of the holes.
Fourballs and foursomes are fascinating to look at up close because you can see the interactions between couples, the advice they give and the advice they don’t give, and how a strategy can change in an instant.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and carries a big lead heading into the final day, but this foursome session also showed that the U.S. team dares to fight, something that some, especially Americans, doubted.
Europe advance 10-6 on final day of Ryder Cup
Europe start with a good lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup, after finishing the fourballs and the foursomes with a result of 10-6 over the United States.
The motivated duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the way with two wins over a struggling Tiger Woods, advancing four points in the Le Golf National standings.
European Thomas Bjorn, trying to keep the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team that made a lot of mistakes during the morning fourballs, which finished 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, winning two games, but failed to shorten distances.
American Jim Furyk needs eight points from Sunday’s 12 individual games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to earn four consecutive points, and he and Molinari, who were nicknamed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to earn four points in their first four Ryder Cup games.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, their magnificent union served to beat a discouraged Woods and American rookie Bryson Decahmbeau by a resounding 5-4.
Woods, who in Saturday’s two games had not excelled too much, had occasional moments of brilliance, but has now lost 19 of his 29 fourball and foursome games, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the morning fourballs, rejoined Henrik Stenson's foursome pairing, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, world number one and number three respectively, with a 2-1 result.
Although the day was pleasant and quiet in the southwest of Paris, Europe didn’t have it all on its side.
The three-time winner, Jordan Spieth, and Justin Thomas served as benchmarks for the Americans, scoring two points on Saturday.
They got a thrilling 2-1 win over Ian Poulter and Spain’s Jon Rahm in the fourballs and then beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the foursomes after losing the opening two holes.
In Ryder Cup history, a team recovering from a four-point gap in individual games has only happened twice, though Furyk, as the trophy holder, only needs one tie to keep it.
Although they have been second best for two days, it seems that carrying out a counterattack on Sunday is beyond their means.
North Korea says 'no chance' it will unilaterally disarm first if it doesn't have confidence
On Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister informed the United Nations that the continuation of sanctions deepened its distrust of the United States and that there was no possibility of its country unilaterally giving up nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "important measures of goodwill" over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear testing facilities and committing to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we did not receive any similar response from the United States," he said.
“If we don’t have confidence in the United States, we can’t have confidence in our national security, and, in those circumstances, there is no chance that we will unilaterally disarm first.”
Although Ri repeated North Korea’s well-known complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phased” denuclearization formula that rewards the country as it takes gradual steps, his statement is important, as he did not outright reject unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referenced a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump following the first summit between an active US president and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore, when Kim pledged to work toward the “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” and Trump guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea has pursued the official end of the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease international sanctions on North Korea.
“The United States has insisted on denuclearization in the first place and has increased pressure through sanctions in order to achieve its purpose in a coercive manner, including by objecting to a declaration of an end to the war,” Ri said.
“The idea that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a chimera of people who don’t know us.
The problem is that the continuation of sanctions deepens our mistrust.”
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, announced loud and clear by the U.S. leader at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings held between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae over the past five months, adding: “If South Korea had been the party interested in denuclearization instead of the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be in such a stalemate.”
Even so, the tone of Ri’s speech was radically different from last year’s speech, when he told the U.N. General Assembly that it was inevitable to direct North Korea’s missiles toward U.S. soil after “evil president” Trump, on a suicide mission, called Kim a “rocket man.”
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in moving toward disarmament, but said much remained to be done and that sanctions needed to be continued until North Korea was denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no deadline set for this: “It could take two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia argue that the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its progress.
However, as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo reported to the U.N. Security Council on Thursday, “The imposition of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without breach until we make definitive and fully verified denuclearization a reality.”
The Security Council has unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006, in a bid to cut off funding for Pyongyang's ballistic missile and nuclear programmes.
Pompeo spoke with Ri outside the U.N. General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying progress had been made, but a few hours later, North Korea denounced his "demands were those of a mobster."
In a meeting with Moon earlier this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States applied “corresponding measures.”
He said Kim had communicated to him that the “corresponding measures” he was seeking were the security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore and steps toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest
Thanks to a new course being taught this year at Harvard University, all college students are getting more sleep in an attempt to fight the growing macho culture of studying all night drinking caffeine.
One professor found that students at the world’s number one university often have no idea about basic self-care.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital designed the course, believed to be the first of its kind in the U.S.
Her motivation to launch the course came after giving a talk about how sleep deprivation affects learning.
“At the end of the course, a girl came up to me and asked me why she just found out about this now, in her senior year.
He said no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," she told The Telegraph.
The course, taught for the first time this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits contribute to academic and sports performance, as well as improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students barely slept during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is an image of a bedroom, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers and books that inform them of the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on sports performance and the importance of establishing a bedtime routine.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then, a campus icon with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
“We know it’s not going to change student behavior instantly.
However, we believe that they have a right to know, just as anyone has a right to know the health effects of smoking tobacco,” Professor Czeisler added.
He said the culture of pride in “sleep-overs” still exists, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students meant sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Getting enough sleep and good quality sleep should be the students’ “secret weapon” to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety; even to avoid gaining weight, as sleep deprivation causes the brain to generate a feeling of hunger, which is why they want to eat all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes the previous year during his freshman year at Harvard.
He noted that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to expand it to the entire campus.
He hopes the next step will be to ask all graduate students to complete a similar program of study before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler's recommendation is that students think about setting an alarm to go to bed and another to wake up, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by the screens of electrical appliances and LEDs, which can alter circadian rhythms, so they would end up having trouble falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga's goal falls to Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another bout of depression away from home, when Dolly Menga's attack banished Steven Gerrard's disjointed team to a 1-0 loss at Livingston.
The Ibrox wanted their first win away from home since the 4-1 win at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team defeated Gerrard's for the second time in 18 games as coach, leaving his team eight points behind the Ladbrokes Premiership leaders.
Menga’s attack came just minutes before halftime and the Rangers’ under-inspired lineup didn’t measure up at all.
Now, the Rangers are down to sixth, Livingston is up to third, behind Hibernian by the goal difference.
The Rangers may be in more trouble, as line judge Calum Spence had to receive medical attention for a head injury after someone allegedly threw an object from the visiting background.
Gerrard switched to eight of the starters who won the match against Ayr, entering the Scottish League Cup semi-finals.
For his part, Holt took out the 11 Livingston players who took a point to the Hearts last week and would have been happy with the way his organized team drowned the opponents at all times.
The Rangers may have had more possession, but Livingston took better advantage of the ball when they had it.
They should have scored within two minutes of the start, when Menga made a pass into space for Scott Pittman who passed between the defense, leaving him alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder sent her out.
Keaghan Jacobs took out a deep foul for Captain Craig Halket, but his fellow defenseman, Alan Lithgow, was only able to send her out for the long stick.
The Rangers regained control, but it seemed there was more hope than conviction about their game in the last third.
There is no doubt that Alfredo Morelos felt that he had been penalized in the 15th minute of the match, when he and Steven Lawless collided, but referee Steven Thomson turned a deaf ear to the Colombian’s request.
The Rangers got two shots on goal in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly barely struggled to deal with Lassana Coulibaly’s header and Ovie Ejaria’s boring pitch.
Although the 34th-minute goal scored by Livingston came against all odds, no one can deny that they deserved it for the dedicated effort.
Again, the Rangers were unable to cope with a deep play to Jacobs' still ball.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher snapped the ball for Scott Robinson, who kept his cool and passed Menga to score the goal.
On the break, Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, which had an almost immediate impact as the steering wheel was passed to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly stepped out of his line to block him.
Still, Livingston kept taking visitors exactly to the kind of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett clearing one long pass after another.
Holt's side could have pulled out more in the final stages, but McGregor held firm to push back Jacobs before Lithgow took a header corner that didn't get in.
Rangers substitute Glen Middleton claimed a penalty towards the end of the game after a run-in with Jacobs, but, again, Thomson looked the other way.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page from the Almanac section of the "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and COUNTING... was born in Germany the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that culminated in the device known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter, which has since become a pillar of science, also became a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "The Bells of Coronado", with actors Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in the seemingly incompatible roles of cowboy scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, it's used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
By putting on your headphones, you can hear the effect of the waves emitted by the radioactivity of the minerals.”
Evans: "It's like a radio!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, when he was about to turn 63.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to “see” malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” malignant cells and kill them.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells.
The method requires removing immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory.
Thus, they can "see" a protein common to many cancers and reinject them.
A trial of the vaccine is generating promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method requires removing immune cells from a patient and altering them in the lab so they can “see” a protein common to many cancers, called HER2, and then reinjecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "promotes the growth of different types of cancer," such as breast, ovarian, lung or colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and "teaching" them to attack cancer cells has worked in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarked on a pro-Trump rant with a MAGA cap after his appearance on SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed at the Saturday Night Live studio after an erratic performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for election in 2020.
After the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, during which he wore the cap with the message Make America Great Again, he began to rant against the Democrats and reiterate his support for Trump.
“A lot of times I talk to a white person and they ask me how I like Trump if he’s racist.
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago,” he said.
SNL kicked off Matt Damon’s sketch show in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh’s statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, comedian Chris Rock uploaded West's recording of the outcry to social media.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to ridicule West with the post.
In addition, West told the audience that he had had a bad time behind the scenes for wearing that cap.
"They messed with me.
They told me not to come out with my hat on.
They messed with me!
And then they tell me I'm asleep," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see how asleep I am?" and added that he was "going to put on his superman cape, because that meant no one could tell him what he had to do.
Try it with love.”
Their comments were booed by the public on at least two occasions and SNL members appeared to be embarrassed, according to Variety. One person told the magazine: "The studio was totally silent."
West had been invited to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West baffled many when he took to the stage to sing I Love it dressed as a bottle of Perrier.
West received support from TPUSA conservative group leader Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR RESISTING TO THE LOT."
Karen Hunter, host of an interview show, tweeted that West was simply “being himself and that’s absolutely wonderful.”
“But I decide NOT to reward someone (buying their music or their clothes, or supporting their art) who I feel is embracing and spreading an ideology that is dangerous to my community.
He's free.
We are too,” he added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now "the person formerly known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name, following in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, Snoop Dogg has also been called Snoop Lion, not to mention the now-defunct music legend, Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.
Charge of attempted murder for stabbing in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in an East Belfast restaurant on Friday.
The incident happened at Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear in Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The prosecutor will review the charges.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is famous for his role as Jon Snow in HBO’s violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor has attacked the stereotype of the male hero, saying those on-screen roles often conveyed to young boys that they had to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes “something has gone wrong” and questioned how to address the issue of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married fellow Game of Thrones cast member Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he finds it “quite important” to address this issue.
“Personally, I think it’s pretty important right now, where have we gone wrong with masculinity?” he said.
“What have we been teaching men as they grew up, thinking about the problems you see now?”
Kit believes that television may bear some of the responsibility for the growing toxic masculinity due to its so masculine characters.
He continued, “What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television, and on the street, that makes young people feel that they have to be this concrete form of man?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time. How do we change it?
Because it is clear that something has gone wrong in the education of young people.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in any Game of Thrones prequels or sequels when the series ends next summer, stating that he is "tired of battlefields and horses".
Starting in November, Kit will star in True West, Sam Shepard’s play that tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks meeting his wife Rose is the best thing he’s ever gotten out of Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife on the show, so in that sense she’s given me my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose represented Ygritte, the love interest of Kit’s character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on a Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% more new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, according to health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, some 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of these were sexually transmitted, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly through parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people contracting HIV in this way has been reduced in its entirety, Chinese health authorities said at a congress held in Yunnan province.
Each year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by about 100,000 people.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the LGBTQ community suffers a lot of discrimination.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies have calculated that between 70% and 90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are due to not using adequate protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV medicines as part of an effort to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of her staff leaked data from Republican Party senators and claims that these are "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Rep. Maxine Waters on Saturday criticized allegations that a member of her staff had posted the personal data of three U.S. senators from the Republican Party on Wikipedia's pages about lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat said those allegations were driven by commentators and “far-right” websites.
“Lies, lies and more vile lies,” Waters wrote on Twitter.
Allegedly, the published information included the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
On Thursday, an unknown person at the Capitol posted the information online during a Senate panel session regarding allegations of sexual misconduct made against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came sometime after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Waters’ office and made the data of a Waters staff member public, according to the Capitol.
“This baseless allegation is completely false and an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of my staff, whose identity, personal data and security have been affected as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations, was not at all responsible for the leak of this information.
This baseless claim is completely false and an absolute lie.”
Waters’ statement drew immediate online criticism, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"Believe this information with anger," Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests not the temperance needed to be a Member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn’t do, they shouldn’t get angry.
He must not rebel.
You must not question the accuser’s motives.
He must remain calm and serene.”
It appears Fleischer wanted to compare Waters’ reaction to Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, whom detractors accused of looking too angry during Thursday’s appearance.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who aims to oust Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
“If true, it is very serious,” he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted “relevant authorities and law enforcement entities to these fraudulent allegations.”
“We will make sure that the perpetrators are discovered,” he continued, “and that they are held legally accountable for all of these destructive and dangerous actions for all members of my staff.”
Johnny English review: Rowan Atkinson's spy parody falls short
Now it has become a tradition to look for nods to Brexit in any new film with a British approach. It seems that this is what corresponds to do with this new installment of the parodic franchise of action and comedy Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Returns.
Is this ironic self-satisfaction about how clearly disparate we are the nation’s new export opportunity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his bulging eyes and expressionless face, has renewed his license to screw up for the second time. Only his name already gives clues that, more than anything, it is a comic creation designed for non-English-speaking cinephile territories.
Of course, it’s the ridiculous secret agent who, despite his strange pretensions to splurge on glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr. Bean and a pinch of that kind who played a single note on the theme of Chariots of Fire that was played at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
In addition, in its origin it was based on the mysterious traveler and international man represented years ago by Atkinson in the already forgotten television ads of Barclaycard, sowing chaos behind him.
In this last installment, there are one or two good moments.
I loved seeing Johnny English approaching a helicopter dressed in medieval armor as the propellers crashed into the hull.
Atkinson’s gift for physical comedy comes into view, but the humor falls rather short and is strangely superfluous, especially now that “serious” movie franchises like 007 and Mission Impossible add comical ingredients without a hitch.
The humor seems more aimed at children than adults and, to me, Johnny English’s absurd misadventures are not as witty and accurate as Atkinson’s silent jokes in the role of Mr. Bean.
Now, the current argument is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A hacker has infiltrated Britain’s super-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all its active agents to the dismay of the agent on duty, a regrettably small role for Kevin Eldon.
It’s the last straw for the prime minister, a pompous, cornered character who’s seeing her political popularity sink in: Emma Thompson gives her best in this character who’s almost like Theresa May, but the script doesn’t leave much room for work.
His intelligence advisers inform him that, as all active spies are in danger, he will have to turn to someone who is retired.
That has to be the clumsy Johnny English, who now teaches at a crappy school, although he gives unofficial lessons on how to be a secret agent: there are some good jokes, since it is a spy academy similar to that of Rock School.
English is transferred to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunites with his long-suffering old sidekick Bough, represented again by Ben Miller.
Now, Bough is a man married to a submarine captain, a sympathetic role for which Vicki Pepperdine is not taken advantage of enough.
Thus, the Batman and Robin who do things terribly wrong in Her Majesty's Secret Service return to action, with the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova, represented by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is falling into the dangerous clutches of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurd situations: they disguise themselves as waiters, set fire to an elegant French restaurant, unleash chaos by hiding on Volta’s luxurious yacht; in addition, English becomes pure anarchy when trying to use a virtual reality helmet to familiarize themselves with the interior of Volta’s house.
Definitely, they were used thoroughly in that last sequence, but, as funny and resounding as it is, the whole continues to convey a somewhat childish feeling.
A fairly regular product.
As with Johnny English’s other films, I couldn’t help but wonder if the British film industry couldn’t give Rowan Atkinson a role that would do true justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is drawing up a plan for Britons to work four days a week, but charge five.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is going to think of a radical plan that the British would work with four days a week, but charge five.
Allegedly, the party wants business owners to allocate the savings from the revolution in artificial intelligence (AI) to workers, giving them an extra day off.
Thus, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend for the same salary.
According to the sources, the idea would "fit" into the party's plans and economic agenda of tilting the country in favor of workers.
This change to a four-day week has received the support of the Congress of Trade Unions, as it is a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
As a senior Labour Party official told The Sunday Times: “An announcement of a review of the board is expected before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but the four-day workweek is definitely an issue that the party hopes to incorporate to rebalance the economy in favor of the worker, as well as in the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to endorse such ideas, as the Green Party has already promised a four-day working week in its campaign for the 2017 general election.
At the moment, however, not all Labour support this decision.
A Labour spokesman said: "The four-day working week is not part of party policy and will not be discussed at this time."
Shadow Finance Minister John McDonnell used last week’s Labour Party conference to set out his idea for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was willing to reclaim powers from "anonymous" and "harnessed" directors at companies that provide public services.
The shadow minister’s plans also include the idea that current water company shareholders will not recoup their full stake, as a Labour government could apply deductions that correspond to perceived irregularities.
It also confirmed its intention to include workers on company boards and create inclusive ownership funds to allocate 10% of private sector companies’ shares to employees, which would result in annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk in "60 Minutes" about the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh and whether it could change their minds
The FBI’s ongoing investigation into the allegations made against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed at least a week the final vote for his confirmation as a Supreme Court justice and also raises the question of whether the final results could influence any Republican senator who ultimately decides to withdraw his support.
In an interview to be aired Sunday, "60 Minutes" reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham about whether the FBI could bring to light information that would change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
“I was in favor of proceeding with the hearing, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after all this happened, the allegation came out, and I asked him, 'Did you do it?'
He was determined, determined, and determined.”
Graham’s vote, however, seems immovable.
“I already have a decision made around Brett Kavanaugh and I would dismiss the allegation,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett denied it outright," Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of the people she appoints have been able to confirm it.
36 years ago.
It’s always the same, I don’t see anything new in this case.”
What is the "Global Citizen Festival"? Has it managed to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival, where an impressive line-up of stars gather for an equally impressive mission: to end poverty in the world.
This year, in its seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people move to the Great Lawn of Central Park to enjoy performances such as those of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the real objective of the event: to end extreme poverty in 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international awareness group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
If you want to receive a free ticket to the event (unless you can afford a VIP ticket), concertgoers have had to complete a series of tasks or “actions,” such as volunteering, sending emails to a world leader, making a phone call, or anything else that serves to raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
However, what has the Global Citizen achieved 12 years from reaching its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding with a free concert a genuine way of persuading people to take action or is it just a form of so-called “clitivism,” which is called the stance we take when we think we’re doing something really useful by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have recorded more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters in favor of a large number of diverse goals.
Thanks to these actions, they claim to have managed to get world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will impact the lives of more than 2,250 million people in 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements that emerged from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that guaranteed funds have directly influenced nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Among the most important commitments is “The Power of Nutrition”, a UK-based association of investors and implementers united by a common commitment to “help children grow and develop to their full potential.” To this end, they have set out to provide Rwanda $35 million to help end the country’s malnutrition after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens contributors.
“Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens collaborators like you, we can mark a small milestone in the history of the social injustice of malnutrition,” Tracey Ullman, ambassador of “The Power of Nutrition,” told the crowd during an April 2018 concert in London.
The group also claimed that, having carried out more than 5,000 actions to try to improve nutrition in the UK for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, whereby 5 million women and children will benefit from nutrition-related interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their website about what we believe can be done to remedy extreme poverty,
A Global Citizen contributor responded: “It will be a long and hard road and, on many occasions, we will stumble and fall.
But, as the human rights and anti-apartheid movements have done before, we will achieve our goals, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are some of the performances we will have at this year’s New York event, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use Navy to carry out blockade on Russian energy exports - Secretary of the Interior
“If necessary, Washington could turn to its Navy to prevent Russian energy from shaking up markets, including in the Middle East, U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia’s alliance with Syria, particularly where it operates at the behest of the legitimate government, is merely a pretext for expansion into new markets.
"I am convinced that they are in the Middle East to negotiate with energy, as they do with Eastern Europe, becoming the southernmost supplier of Europe," he said.
Moreover, according to official information, there are ways and methods of dealing with this issue.
“The United States, with its Navy, has the ability to ensure that the sea lanes remain open and, if necessary, could even block them to ensure that energy does not end up on the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed people who attended an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that defines itself as the “voice of the energy consumer” in the United States.
In it, he compared the approaches Washington maintains in its negotiations with Russia and Iran, and warned that they are, in fact, the same.
“The economic alternative in Iran and Russia is basically to take advantage of and replace fuels,” he warned while indicating that Russia only knows how to do one thing, which is base its economy on fossil fuels.
These claims are made when the Trump administration has been trying to boost the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe and relieve Russia, which is the cheapest option for European consumers.
To do this, members of the Trump administration, including Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which according to Trump will make Berlin a hostage of Moscow.
Moscow has at all times insisted that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which reaches a value of $11 billion and is intended to double the current capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fervent opposition to the project responds only to economic reasons and is yet another sign of unfair competition.
“I think we all share the idea that energy cannot become a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after holding a meeting with Rick Perry, the U.S. Secretary of Energy, last September in Moscow.
The American position has been met, however, with the rejection of Germany, who has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s industry-leading organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the U.S. not to intervene in EU energy policy or bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"It's a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) said after a meeting recently between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Will Carefully Consider Running for President in 2020, Says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she will consider joining the presidential race after the midterm elections.
During an appearance at Holyoke City Hall, Warren confirmed that this challenge was being posed.
“It is time for women to come to Washington to mend our fractured government and for women to finally be among the leaders,” she said, according to The Hill.
“After November 6, I’m going to seriously consider running for president.”
Warren gave his opinion on President Donald Trump during an appearance at City Hall and claimed that "he was leading the country down the wrong path."
“I’m really concerned about the damage that Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren spoke bluntly about Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet Friday, Warren said "it is absolutely necessary for the FBI to investigate what happened before the vote."
A poll was released Thursday in which, however, a majority of Warren’s own voters do not believe he should run for office in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
However, 32% of respondents did support his candidacy.
The survey showed greater support for the previous governor, Deval Patrick, with 38% support for a possible candidacy and 48% against.
Other well-known members of the Democratic Party spoke about the possible 2020 candidacy of former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin Discusses Track Palin's Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder at Donald Trump Rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
Last Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“The situation that my son is going through, for everything that has happened since he returned, he is very well known to the other families who suffer the effects of PTSD and other injuries that our soldiers come back with,” he told the audience that gathered at a rally in favor of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to this arrest as the great taboo that no one wants to talk about, and commented on his son and other war veterans who "come back with a different, hardened demeanor, wondering if there really is that respect for what their fellow soldiers and airmen, as well as all the other members of the military, have given their country."
On Monday, he was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, on charges of an episode of domestic violence against a woman that interferes with a complaint of domestic violence and possession of weapons while under the influence of drugs or alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla police department.
18 states, D.C. support the challenge to get a new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support a court remedy to the new U.S. policy denying asylum to victims fleeing domestic or gang violence.
Representatives from all 18 states and the district filed a “friendly” brief on Friday in Washington to show their support for an asylum seeker facing the current directive, NBC News reported.
The plaintiff’s full name has not been disclosed in the “Grace v. Sessions” case filed in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy.
She said her partner “and her children, who are members of a violent gang,” abused her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum request on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Attorneys representing these Grace-defending states described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum applications to the U.S., as nations facing widespread problems related to domestic and gang violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) that undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence could apply for asylum in this country.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of international, federal and state law.”
“Under federal law, all asylum applications must be adjudicated under the particular facts and circumstances of the claim and, instead, this exception violates that principle,” the amicus curiae states.
The lawyers also said in the filing that the policy denying entry to immigrants hurts the U.S. economy by saying they tend to become entrepreneurs more often and "are a necessary workforce."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
“People who leave their home countries because of persecution or threats based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion may apply for asylum,” Sessions said when announcing the directive on June 11.
Asylum was never created as a measure to alleviate all the problems, not even all the serious problems, that people around the world face on a daily basis.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll rises in race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was increasingly dire.
“The situation is very tense,” Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told us as she tried to comfort her fever baby at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute ambulances arrive with more bodies.
And clean water is scarce.”
Some residents have returned to their destroyed homes to rummage through the few flooded belongings they have left in an effort to recover what they can.
Hundreds of people are injured and hospitals, also damaged by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake, are overflowing.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who has a broken back and shoulder, were resting outside Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated outside the building due to the continuous aftershocks, also very strong.
I couldn’t help but cry when he told us about the violent earthquake he experienced while he was on the 5th floor of the hotel with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to get safe.
I got stuck in the wreckage of the crumbling wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, as he and his family were in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife ask for help and then a tremendous silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're okay."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of 'Bullying' with 'Propaganda Ads'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper touting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread its propaganda.
Last Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump referenced the China Daily pay supplement in the Des Moines Register, Iowa’s top-selling newspaper, after accusing China of wanting to meddle in the Nov. 6 U.S. congressional election, something China flatly denies.
Trump’s accusation of Beijing’s attempt to influence the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in a growing campaign launched by Washington to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to run ads to promote their trade activities, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a growing trade war that has led them to raise tariff levels on imports by both sides.
China’s countervailing tariffs that were applied at the start of the trade war were intended to fall on exporters from states like Iowa, which backed Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former governor of Iowa, which is one of the top exporters of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businessmen.
As Branstad wrote in an op-ed in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, China is “further intensifying that pressure with ad postings in our free press.”
“To try to spread its propaganda, the Chinese government is using America’s cherished tradition of free speech and free press to try to run a paid ad in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
"Instead, on the street kiosk where we are here in Beijing, you see only a few dissenting voices and no real reflection of the disparate opinions that people in China may have about the worrying trajectory that their country's economy is taking, as the media is controlled by the firm pressure of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most relevant newspapers shied away from the offer to publish" his article, although he did not specify which newspaper it was.
Analysts point out that Republicans are distancing themselves from women ahead of the midterm vote with the Kavanaugh debacle
As many prominent Republicans are closing ranks in favor of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of the various allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that there may be a setback, especially by women, in the upcoming midterms.
The emotions surrounding this event have been very intense and many Republicans have expressed that they want to go ahead with the vote.
“In these kinds of matters it’s not possible to turn back,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, told The Hill in a paper published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake’s latest attempt to position himself in favor of the FBI investigation would be enough to appease voters upset about the issue.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday; they are not going to forget tomorrow or in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, said Friday, according to the Washington, D.C., newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters who gathered outside the Senate were chanting “November is coming!” as Republicans who controlled the Judiciary Committee decided to press ahead with Kavanaugh’s candidacy, despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, the Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats is out of line," Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst, told the news site.
“People say that the impact is already very relevant and, indeed, it is.
But it could be even bigger, especially among undecided women in the suburbs and younger voters, ages 18 to 29, who don’t usually vote even if they don’t like the president.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony detailing his sexual abuse allegations against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts indicated there could be a setback if Republicans went ahead with confirmation.
“This matter has become a big mess for the Republican Party,” Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier last week, NBC News reported.
“It’s no longer just a matter of the committee vote or the final vote, or even whether Kavanaugh is on the bench; it’s also about how the Republicans have handled all of this and how they’ve treated her,” said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA.
Americans, however, seem to be divided; they don’t know who to believe after the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, although a few more are siding with the latter.
In a new YouGov survey, 41% of respondents say they definitely or probably believe Ford’s testimony, while 35% say they definitely or probably believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh likely or definitely lied during his testimony, while 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s push, the FBI is now investigating Ford’s statements, as well as, at least, those of another whistleblower, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week and said Kavanaugh raped her while drunk at the age of 17.
For his part, Ramirez alleged that the Supreme Court nominee showed him his genitals at a party when he was studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that tries to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is the latest project of the technology legend. A company that is based on Berners-Lee’s Solid open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people will have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt is to "dominate the world."
“It has to be now,” he said of the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid’s technology so users can create their own “online personal data storage” or a POD.
It can contain lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available in one browser at the same time.
What is unique about personal online data storage is that the user is the one who completely decides who can access what kind of information.
The company calls it “personal training through data.”
Inrupt’s idea, according to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, is to incorporate resources, processes and the skills necessary for Solid to reach everyone.
At the moment, the company is made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that IBM bought, some of the developers hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, tech developers around the world could create their own decentralized apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to “Facebook and Google about whether or not a radical change is going to be introduced where all of their business models are completely modified overnight.
"We're not going to ask for permission."
In a Medium post on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote about Inrupt that “its mission is to provide commercial power and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web created on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has played a very influential role in the net neutrality debate.
Despite even launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this next era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: the clergyman who won a Victoria Cross in World War I
The only clergyman in the Church of England to win a Victoria Cross during World War I as a combatant has been honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lt. Col. Bernard Vann was awarded this award on September 29, 1918, in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, a sniper killed him four days later and he never knew that he had been awarded the highest British military honour.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren discovered a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of them, Michael Vann, said it was “of special symbolism” that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after the battle that earned his grandfather the award.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann guided his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a thick fog and under intense machine-gun and cannon fire".
He then ran to the line of fire and, with "greater courage," advanced the line before reaching a cannon with one hand and shooting down three of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just one month after the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "so great that I can never live up to them, but they were very sobering."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a wreath after the parade, which featured the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said "it was a privilege for him to be a part of the parade" and added that "the value of a true hero is evident when you show him such a large support."
MMA fans were up all night for Bellator 206, but only saw Peppa Pig
Imagine that you stay up all night to see the entire Bellator 206 so that in the end you are not allowed to see the main event.
The San Jose cartel had 13 fights, six included on the main card, and in the United Kingdom it was going to be broadcast live at night on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face off, UK viewers were stunned when the show switched to Peppa Pig.
Some weren’t surprised after having to stay up until early morning just to watch the fight.
A follower on Twitter described the move to cartoons as "a big joke."
“There’s a government regulation that regulates content that airs after 6 a.m. and it wasn’t appropriate, so they had to switch to kids programming,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the piggy, yes."
Bellator president Scott Coker said they will modify the program to include British viewers in future editions.
“When I think about the broadcast option, I think it can work,” Coker said.
“But it’s at 6 a.m. on Sunday, so we wouldn’t be able to do it until Sunday on our time, which would already be Monday for them.
We're seeing how to do it.
Believe me, when the programming was changed, a lot of messages were received and not all of them were kind, precisely.
We tried to fix it, because at first we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn’t, it was a government problem.
I can promise that next time won't happen.
We will reduce it to five fights instead of six, which are the ones we have normally done. We tried to offer more than usual so that the fans were happy and we passed.
It’s a very unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to the rest because of his sexuality, although this was, in turn, what motivated him to become a winner.
At age 24, he told us that he didn’t realize until he was in high school that “not everyone was like me.”
On the first Desert Island Discs show on Radio 4, hosted by Lauren Laverne, she said her intention when talking about gay rights was to convey “hope” to other people.
He also told us that becoming a father made him start to play down the importance of winning in the Olympics.
The regular host of this legendary show, Kirsty Young, is going to be absent for a few months due to illness.
On Laverne's first show, Daley, who portrayed himself as an outcast, commented that he felt "inferior" to the rest during his childhood, because "it wasn't socially accepted that you liked boys and girls."
He said: “To this day, that feeling of inferiority and being different has really been what has given me the power and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to show that he was “something,” he said, so he wasn’t disappointed when he finally discovered his sexuality.
The winner of two bronze medals at the Olympics has become a prominent profile of the LGBT movement and his image has been used at this year’s Commonwealth Games held in Australia to demand that more countries decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he told it because he felt lucky to live in freedom, without retaliation, and he wanted to pass on that “hope” to other people.
The three-time world champion said it was also a surprise for him to fall in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married the Oscar-winner last year, who has been with her for 20 years, although she specified that the age difference had never been an issue.
“When you’ve lived so long since you were so young” (he went to his first Olympics at age 14 and his father died of cancer three years later), it’s hard to find someone the same age who’s gone through the same ups and downs as you.
The couple had a son in June whom they named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said their "global perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, all the answers would have revolved around 'I have to win a gold medal,'" he said.
“But you know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is, without a doubt, Robbie.”
Her son is named after her father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die and, in fact, one of the last things he asked is if they had the passes for London 2012, because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I wasn’t able to tell him that I wasn’t going to be able to be in the front row,” he said.
“He had his hand between mine when he stopped breathing and it wasn’t until that precise moment when he stopped breathing and died that I realized he wasn’t invincible,” she said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“At that moment I knew that was what I had dreamed of all my life: competing in the pool in front of mine in an Olympic Games, there was nothing better,” he said.
This fact was also what inspired him to choose his first song, Proud by Heather Small, which accompanied him in the preparation phase of the Olympic Games.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, in poor form, stayed on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to reverse his form if he wants to keep it from becoming a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who played in the event held every two years to set a record for the 12th time, was overtaken by Captain Furyk for Saturday’s fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he has so many times done for the United States, the five-time major tournament champion had to settle for cheering in a few moments and, in others, try to perfect his game on the field and thus be able to rectify what afflicts him.
Never the most direct of drivers, not even at the highest point of his career, the 48-year-old is not in his best shape for the Le Golf National course, where the long rough continuously punishes with erroneous blows.
And, if the field is no longer discouraging enough, Mickelson, in Sunday’s ninth game, faces brilliant British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games they’ve played this week.
If the Americans, who were four points down at the start of the 12 individual games, started impressively, Mickelson’s game could have been decisive.
Furyk showed confidence in his partner, nor could he say much more.
“He perfectly understood the role I had today, patted me on the back and, surrounding me with his arm, said I would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He’s in the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to these teams before and this week.
I probably didn’t imagine him playing two games.
I thought it would be more, but that’s how it came out and that’s how we thought it had to be.
He wants to be there, just like the rest of us.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games played.
It could be the last in an entire Ryder Cups career that has never so clearly matched the levels of its individual brand.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 equals, though Furyk said his presence brought many more intangible values to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, witty, he likes to make fun of others; it’s great to have him on the team,” he explained.
“I think the younger players have loved having him as a support, also this week; it was fun.
It’s so much more than just a game.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows leadership may soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows full well that even if you enter with a substantial lead in the final days of the Ryder Cup, it can easily turn into an uncomfortable tournament.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a side captained by Seve Ballesteros held a five-point lead over the Americans, but in the end they only managed to finish off the others by stepping on their heels by a minimal margin, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You don’t stop reminding yourself that we did a great tournament in Valderrama; we also did it in Brookline and lost, we did it in Valderrama and won, but by very little,” Bjorn said, pictured, after seeing the 2018 generation win 5-3 on Friday and leading him with a 10-6 at Le Golf National.
History will teach me and everyone else that this team is not finished.
You have to give it all tomorrow.
Get out there and do what you have to do.
This doesn’t end until the points are on the scoreboard.
We have one goal to achieve, which is to win this trophy, and that’s all we have to think about.
I say it all the time, I focus on the 12 players on our team, but we’re very aware of what’s on the other side where they’re, no more and no less, than the best players in the world.”
Proud of what his players have done on a tough golf course, Bjorn added: "I don't want to overtake.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
What prevails tomorrow are individual performances and this is different.
It’s great to share what happens with a teammate when things are going well, but when you’re out there alone, you put all your golfing skills to the test.
That’s the message you need to get to the players, to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now it’s time to let go of your partner, go and get the best out of yourself.”
In front of Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will try to make his players do better individually than they did as pairs, with the exceptions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points out of four.
The same Furyk has been on both ends in the last days of those great tournaments and has been part of the team that won in Brookline and then ended up losing when Europe carried out the "Miracle of Medinah".
“I remember every word,” he told us when we asked him how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, managed to motivate his players on the final day.
“We have 12 super important games tomorrow, but we have to start as well as we did in Brookline, as you saw in Medinah.
When we all move in one direction, all the pressure falls on those intermediate parties.
We defined our strategy and made them come out with the feeling that we were going to try to do something magical tomorrow.”
Thomas is tasked with trying to lead the fight and take on Rory McIlroy in the main event, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the second half of the list.
“I went with this group of guys in this order because I think they cover the whole route,” Bjorn said of his individual picks.
The new German warship, postponed again
The new German Navy frigate should have been ordered in 2014 to replace old Cold War-era ships, but it won’t be done until at least next year due to faulty systems and escalating costs, local media reported.
The delivery of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the ship that heads the new Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, the newspaper Die Zeit quoted a military spokesman as saying.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the problems that arose after the delivery bothered the completion of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships requested by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
We know that they will include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some invisibility technologies, such as very low radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, so they can be deployed for up to two years away from home ports.
However, the continuous delays have meant that the innovative ships (which were supposed to allow Germany to project its power overseas) will already be outdated when they start to serve, Die Zeit points out.
The ill-fated F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into operation and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipyard since its delivery.
Little was known of the reasons behind the return, but German media cited a number of crucial "software and hardware defects" that left the ship virtually useless if sent on a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly significant, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors – half the staff that were on the old Bremen-class frigates.
The ship was found to be overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy’s ability to add future upgrades.
The 7000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice as heavy as other similar-class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the price of the entire project, including crew training, has also been a problem.
It is believed to have reached €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), instead of the initial €2.2 billion.
The problems attributed to the new frigates are of particular relevance in light of recent warnings about the reduction of Germany’s naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament’s defense committee, acknowledged that the Navy is “running out of ships capable of deploying.”
The official said that the problem has been getting worse over time, because the old ships were taken off the boat, but they have not been replaced with others.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates were able to join the Navy.
The National Trust spies on the secret life of bats
This new research, which has been carried out in a Scottish Highland state, attempts to discover how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
The findings are expected to shed more light on the behaviour of the only flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by the National Trust for Scotland, will follow the common bats and sopranos, as well as the riverside Daubenton bat and long-eared browns from the Inverewe Gardens at Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at strategic locations on the property to track bat activities during the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile research with wearable detectors.
Experts will analyze the sounds picked up on the recordings to find out how often bats call and what species do it.
A report and habitat map will then be produced to create a detailed picture of the environment and its behaviour.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation advisor for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as grassland creation and how forests should be maintained for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the UK have declined considerably over the last century.
They are under threat from construction and development affecting their nests and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and electrical wiring can also pose a risk to them, as can insecticidal papers and other chemical treatments of building materials or attacks from domestic cats.
Bats aren't really blind,
But because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes to achieve their goal.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique that locates ants and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes the subject of bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts in the field, who are dedicated to conducting regular surveys, nest inspections and, sometimes, rescues.
The organisation has even inaugurated Scotland’s first and only dedicated bat reserve in the state of Threate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
Property manager David Thompson says it’s the ideal territory for them.
“Here at Threate, we have a fantastic area for bats,” he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of veteran trees and all the right habitat.
However, there is still a lot unknown about bats, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us better understand what they need to develop.”
It emphasizes the importance of checking for bats before carrying out maintenance tasks within the properties, since a breeding colony can be inadvertently destroyed and 400 females and offspring could be killed, which would mean annihilating an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them, as well as destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish officer in charge of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to collaborate.
He said: “We still have a lot to learn about bats and many other species that we don’t know how their populations evolve.”
Ronaldo denies rape allegations at the same time his lawyers are prosecuting the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has branded the rape allegations as “fake news,” and says people “want to make themselves known” at the expense of his name.
His lawyers have been instructed to report to the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which is where the statements were published.
The Portugal and Juventus forward is accused of raping an American woman, named Kathryn Mayorga, at a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He is accused of having been paid $375,000 to cover up the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
With an Instagram Live video that has already amassed 142 million followers just hours after the news broke, Ronaldo, 33, called the report “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they have said today is false,” the five-time Ballon d’Or winner said, looking at the camera.
“They just want publicity at the expense of my name.
It's the same old story.
They want to make themselves famous just by mentioning me, but that's it, I can't help it.
I’m a happy man and everything is fine,” the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel over allegations that appear in what they have called “an inadmissible reporting of suspicions in the privacy arena,” according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player will seek compensation for “moral damages in an amount commensurate with the severity of the breach, which is probably one of the most serious violations of his personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident reportedly took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player’s room and there he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga stated that Ronaldo knelt down after the alleged incident and told him that he was "99 percent" a "good guy" and that he had let down that "one percent" remaining.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that he was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that they took photographs of the wounds in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was “terror of reprisals” and worried “about being humiliated in public.”
The 34-year-old woman says she is trying to cancel the deal, as she remains traumatized by the facts.
When the alleged aggression occurred, Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United and this summer he has switched to Juve, a great of Italian football for a €100 million contract.
Brexit: UK would always regret losing car makers
The UK would “repent for a lifetime” if it lost its position as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Industry Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, production would be temporarily halted at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese manufacturer said the impact of customs delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which makes Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models, produced about 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My view is that if Britain breaks with the EU at the end of March, there will be production shutdowns at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s managing director in Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers have expressed fears about leaving the EU without a deal, particularly in relation to cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns to which car manufacturers refer revolve around the problems that could arise in the assembly lines in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is based on the “just in time” mode of production, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers to make cars to order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without a deal on March 29, there could be a disruption at the border that, according to the sector, could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to house the amount of material equivalent to more than a day of inventory at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and in such a case production would stop.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan, which sets out future relations with the EU, is "precisely calibrated to avoid those checks at border crossings".
"We need a deal. We want to have the best deal that not only allows us to get out of the way right now but we have to seize the opportunity," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
“The evidence from Toyota, among many other manufacturers, is that we need to be able to continue what has, so far, been a tremendously successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota has not been able to say how long production would stop, but warned that, in the long run, the added costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and, ultimately, costs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is in charge of the Unite union at the plant, said its members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, once those jobs are lost, they never recover.”
A government spokesman said: "We have put in place a precise and convincing plan delineating our future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, White House says
Donald Trump’s high-stakes meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could “be postponed another week” as the dispute over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating interference in the Russian election, links between Trump’s aid and Russia, and a possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Expectation over whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general and thereby compromise Mueller’s independence has fueled Washington’s gossip for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein recorded conversations he had with Trump with a microphone he was wearing to try to relegate the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied that it was true.
However, last Monday he went to the White House, amid news reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump (who was at the United Nations in New York at the time) was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would “prefer not” to fire Rosenstein but the meeting had to be postponed to avoid a conflict with the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee hearing to which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh for a week, although this would delay the Senate plenary vote.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared Sunday on Fox News.
Asked about Rosenstein’s meeting, he said: “No date has been set, it could be this week or another could be postponed, considering everything that is happening with the Supreme Court.
We will decide on the go and I will inform the press, as I usually do.”
Some journalists would refute that claim: Sanders has not held any press conference at the White House since Sept. 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked what the reasons were.
Sanders said the shortage of press briefings was not due to an aversion to TV journalists acting grandiloquently, though he said, “I didn’t disagree with the fact that they’re bragging.”
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press is going to increase.
"The president has more question-and-answer sessions than any president before him," he said, quoting without evidence: "We've tested those numbers."
Press conferences will continue to be held, Sanders said, but "if the press has the option to ask the president of the United States directly, I think it's much better than doing them to me.
We tried to do it many times and you’ve seen us do it many times in the last few weeks, so this would replace a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States.”
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences with him only happen on very rare occasions.
In fact, this week, in New York, the president showed why he was like that, where he made a light-hearted, and at times bizarre, appearance before the journalists who were congregating there.
Secretary of State for Health writes to NHS Scotland EU workers about their fears of Brexit
The Secretary of State for Health has written to the EU staff working at Scotland’s HHS to express the country’s gratitude and its wish that they remain with them after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter just six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to covering the cost of citizenship applications for EU members working in public services that do not depend on the central government.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the exit were continued in which the decisions expected this autumn were chosen.
However, the UK government has also stepped up preparations around a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be very disconcerting to you.
And it is for that very reason that I would like to reiterate now how much I value the contribution of each of the staff members, regardless of their nationality.
Professionals from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and many skills that strengthen and enhance the work of the health service, from which patients and the communities we serve benefit.
Scotland is, without a doubt, your home and we would love to continue to count on you.”
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing emergency surgery after suffering a head injury.
Christion Abercrombie, a Tennessee State Tigers player, underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury on Saturday when they lost 31-27 to Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred shortly before the break.
“He came to the band and collapsed right there,” Reed said.
Both coaches and medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the sideline before placing him on a stretcher and taking him for an in-depth examination.
A Tennessee State staffer told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there were no details on the type of injury yet or the damage caused" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when it happened.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is playing in his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five tackles on Saturday before leaving the field, with which he added a total of 18 throughout the season.
Foreigners will be charged a higher property transfer tax when buying a property in the UK
Foreigners will be charged a higher estate transfer tax when they buy a property in the UK and the extra money raised will be used to house the "homeless", according to the Conservatives' new plans.
The change will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s offensive to attract younger voters.
The increase in the property transfer tax will be imposed on those who are not paying taxes in the United Kingdom
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to go to the "homeless"
The additional money raised by the increase in the property transfer tax to foreign buyers of properties in the United Kingdom will go to aid the "homeless", announced today Theresa May.
The move is understood as an attempt to neutralize the success Jeremy Corbyn is reaping with his promises to provide more affordable housing to attract younger and harassing voters to those with higher incomes.
The increase in the farm transfer tax will be taxed on people and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK and that money will be used to incentivise government policy to combat the problem of begging on the streets.
The surcharge, which is a supplement to the current transmission tax, including also the increase in levels introduced two years ago on second-hand housing and the buy-to-let system, could be up to 3%.
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year with this change.
An estimated 13 per cent of London’s new-build properties are bought by non-UK residents, driving up prices and making it difficult for first-time buyers to access affordable housing.
Many of the wealthiest areas of the country (especially in the capital) have become "ghost cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the transmission tax to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining very high property prices by avidly buying land without intending to use it and urged Mrs May to eliminate quotas on affordable housing to solve the "shameful housing problem" in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a number of very attractive housing reforms, including rent controls and an end to evictions for no reason.
It also proposes giving local powers more power to build new housing.
Mrs May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my role as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream of improving the lives of every new generation.
And that means fixing the housing market, which is so devastated.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be that people who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, can buy homes more easily than the British working class.
The dream of having a home has become too difficult for many people to achieve and the humiliation of having to sleep on the street is still too real.”
Jack Ross: "My primary goal is to run Scotland"
The Sunderland coach says his "primary goal" is to become Scotland coach at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot is excited about the possibility of revitalizing the northeastern club, which at the moment occupies third place in League One (England's third league division), three points from the first.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking the St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
But I only got a B cap," Ross told Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
“But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father as a kid and it’s something he’s always made me want to come back to.
That opportunity will only become a reality, however, if I manage to run a club successfully.”
Ross's predecessors as manager of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager says he felt no fear when he switched to such established names at such a large club, after turning down proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Right now, success for me is measured by whether I can return this club to the Premier League.
“The structure and facilities of this club correspond, without a doubt, to those of the Premier League,” he said.
“It’s not easy to achieve, but I could only consider that I have achieved my goal here when I can return the club to where it belongs.”
Ross has only been coaching for three years, after a stint as an assistant coach at Dumbarton and a 15-month stint on the Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third division and moved St. Mirren from being on the verge of relegation to winning the championship the following season.
In fact, Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever before during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was probably a real crossroads,” he recalled in reference to when he took over the Alloa.
“I always believed that direction was the best thing for me, much more than playing.
It may sound weird, because it was good, I was able to make a very good living with it and enjoyed some epic moments.
But playing can be very hard.
You have to face a lot of things every week.
I still suffer from the stress and pressure of that work; however, in the direction I feel good.
I always wanted to train and now I have managed to do it, it is the time of my adult life in which I have felt better, without a doubt.

According to a survey, the perfect time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday.
The summer heatwave has boosted profits in struggling British pubs but concentrated all the pressure on restaurant chains.
Pub and bar groups saw their sales increase by 2.7% in July, while restaurant profits fell by 4.8%, the figures revealed.
Peter Martin of CGA, which compiled the figures, said: “The heat these days and the fact that England is still in the World Cup have still kept the pattern of the previous month of June, in which pubs increased their profits by 2.8%, although restaurants have fallen even more.
The 1.8% drop in restaurant business activity in June was even worse in July.
Pubs and bars serving mostly beverages had their strongest month, versus most restaurants, in which they reduced profits.
Pubs serving mostly meals also suffered from the heat, though not as drastically as restaurant operators.
It seems that people just want to go out for a drink.
In managed bars and pubs, beverage sales rose as much as 6.6% during the month, while meals fell by 3%.
Paul Newman, RSM’s hospitality and leisure analysts, said: “These results follow the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The time and impact of very important social or sporting events remain the most relevant factors when it comes to sales in the market of activities outside the home.
Not surprisingly, restaurant groups continue to struggle, although the 4.8% drop in sales compared to last year will be especially painful in view of continued cost pressures.
The long, hot summer couldn’t have come at a worse time for food operators and time will tell if the more moderate temperatures we’ve had in August will provide the relief they need.
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new ones that have opened, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slow decline in brand deployments.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which oversees sales in the UK restaurant, bar and pub sector, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion and is the market benchmark.
One in five children have secret social media accounts behind their parents’ backs
One in five children (some as young as 11) have secret social media accounts behind the backs of their parents and teachers, a survey reveals.
Survey of 20,000 High School Students Reveals Growth in Fake Instagram Pages
News has heightened fears of sexual content being published
20% of students said they have a “principal” account that shows their parents
One in five children (some as young as 11) create social media accounts that hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the rapid growth that has been experienced on fake accounts of Instagram, a reference site for sharing photos.
The news has heightened fears of sexual content being published.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a sanitized “principal” account that they showed to their parents, while they had other private accounts.
A mother who stumbled across her 13-year-old daughter’s secret website saw a teenager encourage others to “rape me.”
The research, conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40% of children aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, said: “It’s alarming that so many teens are tempted to create spaces on the internet where their parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" in the board of the athletics federation of Scotland
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of the Scottish Athletics Federation as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most awarded track and field athlete and her president, Ian Beattie, described the change as a great opportunity for those who want the sport to benefit from her great international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidh is recognised and respected throughout the athletics community in Scotland, the UK and around the world, and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from having her on board,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I like being the spokesperson for the athletes and I hope to be able to contribute things and help develop the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta among the four golds he won and is now a regular expert on the BBC, suffered a transient ischemic attack that left him unable to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
According to the doctors, only time would determine if I would recover or to what extent I would.
It has been exhausting, but I managed to fully recover, I had to learn to walk again and I am currently doing agility exercises.
Thank you for the messages and words of encouragement!”
Breastfeeding ad comparing mothers to cows divides opinion on the Internet
A breast pump company has divided public opinion on the Internet with an ad comparing mothers who breastfeed to cows they milk.
To mark the launch of what is in theory the “world’s first silent breast pump,” consumer technology company Elvie ran an ad inspired by a somewhat ironic music video showing moms recounting the freedom the new breast pump gives them.
Four royal women dance in a hay barn as a dance floor, along with cows, with letters such as "Yes, I milk myself, but I have no tail" and "In case you haven't noticed, they're not udders, they're my breasts."
The chorus goes on to say, "Order them, order them, I'm feeding their babies, order them, order them, I'm milking my women."
However, the announcement, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, has created a huge controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received reactions from all kinds of people who have seen it, where many say it manages to put the focus on the "horrors" of the dairy sector.
"A very unfortunate decision to put cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant before giving birth in order to produce milk, with the exception that they take their babies away from them days after giving birth," one person wrote.
The Elvie breast pump fits discreetly in a nursing bra (Elvie/Mother).
Another person commented, “Traumatic for the mother and for the baby.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who do keep their babies?"
Another comment was: "What a more far-fetched announcement."
However, other people defended the ad, such as a woman who admitted that the song was "goofy".
“I think it’s a great idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I'd probably have one.
When I used the bomb, I felt totally like a cow.
The announcement is a little crazy, but I do not give more turns to it.
It’s a product genius,” one woman told us.
Another person commented, “It’s a funny ad aimed at mothers who use a breast pump (sometimes in the workplace or in public toilets), which makes them feel like cows.
The announcement neither praises nor judges the dairy sector.”
At the end of the video, the group of women show that they have been dancing with the discreet bombs placed inside the bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the perception that many women who pump milk say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is totally silent, has no cables or tubes, and discreetly fits inside the lactation bra, which makes its users able to move, hold their babies and even go out on the street with the pump in operation.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD of Mother, comments: "The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By showing the parallels between expressive women and dairy cows, we aimed to draw attention to the use of breast pumps and their challenges, while demonstrating in an entertaining and forthcoming way the incredible sense of freedom offered by the new pump.
This isn’t the first time the Elvie bomb has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two walked the runway for designer Marta Jakubowski while wearing the product.
Hundreds of Immigrant Children Discretely Displaced to Texas Border Camp
The number of detained immigrant children has increased considerably, despite the fact that the monthly influx at the border has practically remained at the usual levels, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration are complicating the possibility of sponsoring these children.
Traditionally, most godparents, who were also undocumented immigrants at the time, feared that proposing to take in a child would jeopardize their own stay in the country.
This risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their families should submit their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with government immigration entities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who asked to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
“About 80 percent of the sponsors or their relatives are in the country illegally, and a large portion of them are criminal immigrants.
Therefore, we continue to pursue these people,” Albence said.
In their effort to prosecute children faster, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a maximum of one month of detention, instead of 60 days, which was the previous rule, according to workers at the shelters.
Many of them will testify by video conference, rather than in person, to defend their legal status before an immigration judge.
Those deemed unfit for protection will be deported as soon as possible.
According to shelter workers and system reports that have emerged in recent months, the longer they remain in custody, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which could lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts.
According to advocates, these concerns are further heightened in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where signs of discomfort in these children are more likely to be overlooked because of their size.
In addition, moving to camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends could cause them a trauma that many are already suffering.
Syria calls on US, French and Turkish ‘occupation forces’ to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return to their homes, despite the country’s war being in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces were illegally on Syrian territory under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that the issue “will be dealt with accordingly.”
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terror is virtually over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and several million uprooted from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to “fight this sacred battle until we purge all Syrian territories” from both terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly providing training and advice to Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces that oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 ground troops in this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said the right conditions were in place for them to return and blamed “some Western countries” for “sowing irrational fears” that made refugees decide to stay out of the country.
“We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have already warned that they will not help with the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib’s last major rebel stronghold has created an opportunity to force political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a full-scale assault by Syrian and Russian forces on the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem has made clear that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action will focus on jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front (linked to Al-Qaeda), who "will be eradicated".
Staffan de Mistura, a U.N. special envoy, hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee made up of members of the government and opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, arguing that the panel's work should be restricted to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warned against any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
By that logic, Trump would win re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberal bystanders will surely expect, an impeachment or scandal prematurely ends his presidency.
This would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic end of a presidency ever seen!”
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue in the spectators.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings have doubled to 1.05 million for CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” has topped cable channel ratings with 3.5 million viewers for major late-night news programs.
“It’s a strange attraction that we still can’t fathom,” says Neal Baer, author-producer of “Designated Survivor,” an ABC drama series about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club,” has another theory.
He remembers a taxi ride he took in Boston before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told him he would vote for Trump.
Why? he asked.
“Because it makes me laugh,” was Scovell’s response.
Chaos is always on the rise in the entertainment world.
Obviously, and unlike anything else seen on television, the arguments coming out of Washington could determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, the possibility that immigrant families might be reunited, or the health of the global economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
However, the information pushes the envelope when you realize you’ve been watching a panel of experts debating the use of the “deep-bottom” sources Bob Woodward used for his book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich-leather jacket (“a garment of immeasurable pride,” in the words of The Washington Post) and the implications of Trump’s scaly Daniels descriptions.
As far as I’m concerned, I’ll never see Super Mario the same way again.
“By offering something new every night, it’s in part what makes everything look like a reality show,” says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars,” when he tells us about the alternating cast of the Trump show and its daily plot twists (either going into a fight with the NFL or praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss an episode if you don't want to be left behind.
When I went to talk to Mr. Fleiss this week, it was a sunny 27-degree day on the north coast of Kauai, but he was holed up indoors watching MSNBC while taping CNN.
He couldn’t get off the TV, not with Brett Kavanaugh ready to take on the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance.
“I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows and people were telling us that this was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was all a joke, but in the end it turned out they were right.”

Foreign money flows in tighter House of Representatives midterm elections
It’s no surprise the influx of money is pouring into Pennsylvania’s 17th district, thanks to the restructuring of a congressional district with two candidates seeking re-election for the same seat.
This newly redesigned residential district of Pittsburg has Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another candidate for re-election, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania’s former 12th district, a district that largely overlaps with the new 17th.
The maps were redesigned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the former districts had been unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of Republicans.
The race for the new 17 has triggered a campaign finance race between the main financial arms of the parties, the National Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb’s name became very familiar in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a special election held in March for Pennsylvania’s 18th Congressional District.
That seat had been held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political pundits have given Democrats a slight advantage.
The U.S. considered penalizing El Salvador for its support of China, although after
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with a slight rejection by Washington.
Trump had an affable meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and occupied a hotel in Panama until the partners evicted the Trump Organization’s management team.
State Department officials decided to return the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of “recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan,” department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement this month.
But it was only decided to sanction El Salvador, which had already received aid of around 140 million US dollars 2017 for, among other issues, drug trafficking control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts to financial aid and restrictions on certain visas, would have been very painful for the Central American country and its high rates of unemployment and crime.
As the internal meetings progressed, U.S. and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting held last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent emigration to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they intended the conference to go ahead, ending any consideration of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to speak at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October and is seen as a sign of the importance the administration has given to the meeting.
The three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further threats or punishment from Washington.
A Bolton White House spokesman declined to comment on details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to handle the internal deliberations on the condition of anonymity.
His explanations were corroborated by an outside analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
The study of history
The next planned step could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, of which there is already considerable evidence in the public record.
It is thought that Mueller is also leading this investigation into the possibility that the Trump campaign worked in parallel with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Trump will be held accountable to that chamber, just as he prepares to stand before voters again, and perhaps finally before a jury of his peers.
This is a lot of conditionals, and by that I don’t suggest that Trump’s downfall is inevitable, nor that of his counterparts in Europe.
We will all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an effect on the duration of the contest.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler; all that was needed was for the West to resist him and support the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around these turning points, and the inexorable march of democracy is speeded up or delayed.
Americans are now facing several of these tipping points.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been on a roll since this newspaper reported that last year he had suggested secretly taping the president and had speculated about his incapacity for office.
Rosenstein says The Times' explanation is not accurate.
“How will we respond if the new investigation the FBI has requested of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if his position on the Supreme Court is upheld despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
On top of all this, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will be accountable to Trump?
If we fail these tests, we will find a long winter for democracy.
But, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague, I believe we will not fail.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once occupied my ambassador’s house.
He survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the same table adorned with a swastika.
With that heritage, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimistic about Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will play at home on Thursday against Rapid Vienna, knowing that a win over the Austrians, after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season until the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard for bigger things.
"We managed to get a good point out, as Villarreal are a good team," the 31-year-old said.
“We started the game thinking we could achieve something and we came out with a point.
Perhaps we could have achieved victory in the end, but, overall, the draw was perhaps a fair result.
They were better in the first half, but after the break we went all out and we were the best team.
This Thursday we will have another great European night.
I hope we can get the three points, but it will be a difficult match because they already got a good result in the previous match, but with all the public supporting us, I am sure we will be able to move forward and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough with my injuries and the changes at the club itself, but now there is a general atmosphere that everything will go well.
The team is doing well, the guys are enjoying themselves very much and we are having a good training.
I’m hopeful that we can move forward, move on from last season and achieve success.”
Fear of retirement savings is making some women lose sleep
Despite the fact that survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people talk about this with their family members.
About half of the people who participated in the Nationwide study said they did talk to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
“People want to be cared for by a family member, but they’re not taking the steps to have this conversation,” says Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance company Nationwide.
This is the way to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You won’t be able to prepare your family to care for you if you don’t express your wishes early enough.
Work with your counselor and family to talk about where and how to get care, as those options can be a cost determining factor.
Incorporate your financial advisor into the conversion, as it can also help you find a way to pay for those expenses.
Your long-term care financing options may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash-value hybrid life insurance policy to help you cover expenses, or insuring yourself with your own savings, as long as you have the money.
Negotiate your legal documents: get ahead of the legal battles.
Take charge of obtaining a health care power of attorney to designate a trusted person to oversee your health care and to make sure that the professionals comply with their own wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
You can also prepare a power of attorney for your finances.
Select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure your bills are paid if you become incapacitated.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine your elderly father has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Describe all these details in a written plan so that you are always ready.
“It’s not just finances that are at stake: which doctors should you deal with?” asks Martin.
“What medications are you taking?
Who will take care of the dog?
Everything has to be planned.”
Man shot several times with a carbine in Ilfracombe
A man has been shot several times with a carbine while walking home after going out at night.
The victim, a man in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe (Devon) when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which occurred around 02:30 British time, as a “random act.”
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries are not fatal and police have called potential witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
With communications blocked, aid officials have been unable to obtain any information from the regency of Donggala, an area north of Palu that is closest to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude quake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here you can see some important details about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, which lies at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
Donggala is a regency that stretches along more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The regency, which is a hierarchically inferior administrative region to the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 people in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the mainstays of the economy of Central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines also have their importance in the province, but are concentrated mostly in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck west of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, an area of high seismic activity, and often suffers earthquakes frequently.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake off the west coast of Indonesia’s Aceh province in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami on 26 December that affected 14 countries and claimed the lives of 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast. More than half of the casualties occurred in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
There were hundreds of fatalities on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia’s most populous island, and triggered a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands near Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 meters that tore apart dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Regency of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as it recalls the devastation of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time it did not cause any tsunami, but the collapse of buildings caused the death of more than 100 people.
2018: The tourist island of Lombok (Indonesia) had a series of large earthquakes that caused the death of more than 500 people, most on the north side of the island.
The earthquake devastated thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily evicted.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on assault charges.
Palin, 29, a citizen of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to the report released Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, when an acquaintance of his tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone away.
Palin has been ordered remanded in custody at Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held on an unsecured $500 bond, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, declaring himself "definitely innocent" when asked to testify, the network said.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, meaning he could spend up to a year in prison and receive a $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with a Class B misdemeanor, with a one-day jail sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interfering with the reporting of a domestic violence offence and possessing a weapon while intoxicated, in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend had claimed he punched him in the face.
Several veteran groups criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking her son’s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder stemming from her service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami: hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have fallen and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred right next to central Sulawesi, which lies northeast of Jakarta, Indonesia’s capital.
There are several videos circulating on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors exceptionally seek death penalty for terror attack suspect in New York
New York federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people, an exceptional punishment that has not been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike lane on the West Side Freeway in Lower Manhattan last October, shooting down pedestrians and cyclists he encountered on his way.
To justify a death penalty, prosecutors will need to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed the eight victims and “intentionally” caused serious bodily injury, according to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both charges carry a possible death penalty, according to the court document.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury presented Saipov with a 22-count indictment that included eight counts of murder with the help of organized crime, which federal prosecutors typically use in these cases, and one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “substantial planning and premeditation,” according to prosecutors, who described the way Saipov carried it out as “heinous, cruel and depraved.”
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the notice said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been a decade since the Southern District of New York last prosecuted a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug traffickers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed in a federal case in New York was Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in 1953. This marriage was executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The two Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan, demonstrated his lack of remorse during the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
According to police, he told investigators he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that for his attack he was inspired by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also requested that the ISIS flag be hoisted in his hospital room, police said.
He has pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defense attorneys representing Saipov, said they are “obviously disappointed” with the prosecution’s decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept a life sentence conviction with no possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to “mobilize the people’s army” today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former UKIP leader said politicians had to "feel the heat" from eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May's MPs suggested he should take over negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham rally that the UK "would have already left" if Farage had been Brexit Secretary.
But Prime Minister May’s challenge to reconcile her divided ranks has been highlighted even more when a pro-remain Tory group has joined an opposing protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep the compromise plan that was signed at Chequers alive amid attacks from pro-Brexit Brexiteers, her opponents and the EU.
The allies insisted that it will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the backlash, and will force eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between its package and "chaos".
Congressman Bone said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to reject the Chequers plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been given a seat with responsibility in the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had been in charge, we would have left already,” he said.
This Member of Parliament for Wellingborough added: "I will defend Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers."
In his statement of opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in world wars to be servile.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their mind and want to stay in the European Union is completely false.”
Pro-Brexit Tory Andrea Jenkyns was also at the rally, where she told reporters: "I'm just saying one thing: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The general public doesn’t like the Chequers plan, the opposition isn’t going to vote for it, and it’s not popular with our party and our activists, who are the ones who actually take to the streets and vote for us in the first place.
Forget about Chequers and start listening."
In a message to May, he added: “Prime Ministers hold their office when they deliver on their promises.”
Farage told the rally that politicians would have to be made to "feel the heat" if they were to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s a question of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They are trying to betray Brexit and today we are here to tell them that we will not let them get away with it.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.
“We will mobilise the people’s army of this country that gave us victory with Brexit and we will never rest until we have become an independent, self-governing and proud Britain.”
Meanwhile, those in favor of permanence toured the streets of Birmingham before the two-hour rally in the city center.
Some activists waved Tories Against Brexit banners after the group’s presentation this weekend.
Labour’s Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security problems they had with a party application during the opening of the conference.
“These are the same people who are telling us that they can implement the computer systems and all the technology for Canada Plus Plus, for borders in harmony, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It is a total farce.
There is nothing that can be considered a good Brexit," he added.
Warren Considers All Chances of Running for President
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will “consider every possibility of running for president” after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a town hall meeting held Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, the Republican state representative who was co-chair of Trump’s Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
There has been considerable speculation about the possibility that Warren will face Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon’s event in Holyoke was his thirty-sixth meeting with voters using the municipal format since Trump took office.
An aide asked him if he planned to run for president.
Warren responded that the time has come for “women to go to Washington to fix our irregular government, and that includes having a woman at the top.”
A man arrested for the LSU Sims player's gun murder
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in the shooting death of Wayde Sims, the LSU basketball player, last Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at a news conference at 11 a.m.
They had posted a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying a man seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near the Southern University campus early Friday.
“Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head that ultimately resulted in his death,” Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told media Saturday, for 247sports.
Wayde went to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
During questioning, Simpson admitted to being at the scene of the crime, possessing a gun and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and arrested at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 1.98-meter-tall Baton Rouge native, played in 32 games last season, starting in 10 of them, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after team orders deliver victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes’ team orders would play an important role in the race.
From pole, Bottas had a good start and almost threw Hamilton into oblivion by defending his position in the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to pit and let Hamilton run in the tail of the group, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes came out strong a lap later and got behind Vettel, but Hamilton came forward after an action with the wheels almost glued that made the Ferrari driver have to reluctantly leave the interior free at the risk of resisting after a double move to defend himself in the third corner.
Max Verstappen, who turned 21 that day, started from the last row of the grid and put himself in seventh place at the end of the first lap.
He then led a large part of the race as he clung to his tyres to achieve a quick finish and overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He eventually pitted on lap 44, but was unable to increase his pace over the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen regained fourth position.
It’s been a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman in letting me through.
The team has done an exceptional job to get a perfect match," said Hamilton.
That's been really bad body language.
President Donald Trump taunted Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for her insistence that he did not leak Christine Blasey Ford’s letter accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that there are people who are "bad, disgusting and false."
“The only thing that could happen and the good that is happening these last few days in the Senate, is when you see anger, when you see people who are bad, disgusting and false,” he said.
“When you read the posts and the leaks, and then they say, ‘But I didn’t.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember it?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember his answer... did you leak the document? - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn't filter it."
Well, wait a minute.
No, we haven't filtered it," she added as she imitated the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter detailing allegations against Kavanaugh by Ford in July and leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied the leak came from his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t leak her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep it confidential and therefore I did so.”
But his refusal didn’t seem to sit well with the president, who during Saturday night’s rally commented, “I’ll tell you one thing: that’s been really bad body language.”
Maybe he didn’t, but that’s the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested Democrats were using the allegations for their own ends.
"They are determined to regain power by any means possible.
You see the evil and the disgust, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars repaired Friday's Elite League loss to the Belfast Giants by winning Saturday's 5-3 comeback game in Dundee.
The Giants got a two-goal lead thanks to attacks from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie got the home draw before Dwyer restored the Giants' leadership.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen’s two goals secured his victory.
This was the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe's men, who had just beaten Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth game of the season between the two teams, of which the Giants won all three previous games.
Dwyer’s first goal came in the fourth minute (3:35) thanks to an assist from Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford provided the assist for Beauvillier to double the lead four minutes later.
In what can be considered a very lively opening period, Sullivan put the home team back into the 13:10 minutes before Matt Marquardt assisted Cownie to tie the game in the 15:16 minute.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the lead before the first half when he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard once again tied the game with a goal in the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the game as they reached the end of the second half and secured victory with their team’s fifth goal as the end approached.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, are playing Milton Keynes at home in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies so hundreds of people can escape on earthquake plane
An Indonesian air traffic controller is being hailed as a hero after he died after making sure a plane carrying hundreds of people managed to take off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a large-scale earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to batter the area and many are trapped among the rubble in the city of Palu.
Despite his comrades fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu control tower, which was being hit by heavy rocking.
He stood firm to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the tarmac at the time, could take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the traffic control tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australian broadcaster ABC News reported.
We had prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Sadly, he passed away this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“Our hearts are broken when we hear this,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach several thousand people.The national disaster mitigation agency says access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that the number of victims will continue to increase, as there were still many bodies under the ruins and many people have not been able to contact us," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves reaching up to six meters have devastated Palu, which will hold a mass burial on Sunday.
Aid and supplies are being brought in on military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance arrives with more bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Mini-markets are being looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help the survivors as much as possible, but we don’t know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy in itself, but it could have been much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country’s army: “I ask you all to work day and night to complete all tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia had already been hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok in which more than 550 people died.
Air crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says a man has gone missing after the plane crash in a lagoon
The airline, which operates a flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now says one man has gone missing, having said the 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon it could not account for a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats were used to help rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Authorities said Friday that seven people had been taken to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still at the hospital on Saturday and all were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had passed the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane arrived very low.
“That’s an extremely good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes says he and other travelers made it through waist-deep water to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants panicked and screamed, and that he suffered a mild head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors doing dock improvement work nearby also assisted in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to transport people ashore before the plane sank about 100 feet (30 meters) underwater.
Data from the aviation safety network indicate that 111 people have died in airline accidents recorded in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none with Air Niugini.
An analyst presents the chronology of the night a woman was burned alive
Prosecutors ended their arguments Saturday at the retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to chain the movements of 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones showing Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, contradicting his previous statements, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone had been with Chambers' during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford took the stand on Saturday and testified that he had not been in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had met Chambers about two weeks before his death.
Cell phone records indicated that they met just a week earlier.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers’ death, Tellis deleted Chambers’ messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
“He erased her from her life,” Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be in the hands of the jury that same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to fill their music with positive messages to challenge the genre’s negative image.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip hop moved away from its origins of political messaging and dealing with social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Performers such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
New York nanny sues couple for firing her after 'racist' text
A New York nanny is going to sue a couple for discriminatory dismissal after mistakenly receiving a text message from the mother complaining that she was “another black person.”
The couple denies that it is racist and compares the lawsuit to a case of “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed dismay at the discovery that the new childcare provider, Giselle Maurice, was black on her first day at work in 2016.
“NOOOOOOOOOOOOO ANOTHER BLACK PERSON,” Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After noticing her blunder, an “uncomfortable” Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice claiming that her previous nanny, who was African-American, had done a lousy job and was instead expecting a Filipino, the New York Post claims.
Maurice was paid for the day’s work and sent home by Uber.
Maurice is now suing the couple for compensation for the dismissal with the intention of receiving compensation of $350 a day for the six-month internal work position for which he had been hired, albeit without a contract.
“I want to show them that things are not done that way,” he told The Post on Friday, adding that “I know it’s a case of discrimination.”
The couple responded to claims that they are racist by saying that terminating Maurice's employment was the most reasonable thing to do, as they feared they would not be able to trust her after having offended her.
"My wife had sent him something she didn't want to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racists,” husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you have been rude to, even if it was by mistake?
To your newborn?
Let's go!"
Comparing the lawsuit as an “extortion,” Plasco said his wife had given birth to the baby two months earlier and was in a “very difficult situation.”
"Are you going to go for someone like that?
That’s not that it’s a very decent thing,” the investment banker added.
Although the legal case is still ongoing, the court of public opinion has been quick to denounce the couple on social networks, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington editors feared readers might not identify with a talking bear, new letter reveals
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It was hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone reading it for the first time before it was published.
It’s very funny to know now what we know about Paddington’s great success.”
After saying that his father, who had worked as a BBC cameraman before taking inspiration from a toy bear to write the children's book, was confident that his work would be rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the books' publication was somewhat "bittersweet" after his passing last year.
De Paddington, whom she describes as “a very important member of our family,” added that her father was very proud of his ultimate success.
“He was a very quiet man and he didn’t like to show off,” she said.
But because Paddington had been so real to him, it was almost as if you had a son who accomplishes something important: you’re proud of him, even if it’s not really your merit.
I think he saw Paddington’s success that way.
Although it was his creation and product of his imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone
Upon landing, her daughter was rushed to Louis Pasteur Hospital 2 in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
“Nad called regularly to say that the situation was really bad, that she wasn’t expected to make it,” Ms. Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I got the call from Nad to tell me that I was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And so I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs the doctors had given him to keep his heart pumping were slowly running out and leaving his system.
She had died prematurely and everything was turning off.
I could just sit there and wait, knowing all this was happening.
I couldn’t howl, scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I really had to stand firm.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now suffering from the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, oblivious to the terrible experience she was going through.
"Nobody knew," he said.
"I put my head down and the tears fell all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but it was on the flight that I felt this overwhelming sense of sympathy for Nad.
I needed all my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved her.”
Mourning women put cards to prevent suicides is a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Ms. Davis’ son, Tyler, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and committed suicide at age 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel what I feel every day,” he said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said that their smile lit up any place."
However, he left the job before he died, as he was "in a really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one who found him after taking his own life.
Ms. Davis said, "I am continually concerned that it may have repercussions."
Davis created the cards “to let people know that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t feel silent, you have to talk about it.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner with whom she had been with for 15 years, shortly after her mother’s death.
“He didn’t say he was depressed or anything like that,” she says.
"A couple of days before Christmas we noticed his change of attitude.
Christmas Day reached its lowest point: when the children opened their presents, he didn’t even look at them.
He said that his death was a great trauma for them, but that they have to overcome it: "It leaves a void in the whole family.
It has left us shattered.
But we all have to keep fighting.”

Brett Kavanaugh’s future hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation.
“I thought if we could really get something like what I was asking for (a time-limited, limited-scope investigation), maybe we could bring some unity,” Mr. Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was “going down” in the midst of a partisan standoff.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI investigation to take place?
Its refusal is entirely due to chronology.
With just five weeks to go before the November 6 midterm elections, if, as expected, the Republicans turn out badly, their attempts to get the man they want elected to the country’s highest court will be severely weakened.
George W. Bush has been calling senators, pressuring them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House. Thanks to Bush, Kavanaugh met his wife Ashley, who was the president’s personal secretary.
What happens once the FBI publishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm it for the Supreme Court.
North Korea defector figures ‘fall’ with Kim
The number of defectors from North Korea to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker has said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Southern Unification Ministry, said last year there were 1,127 defections, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China, and high fees charged by human traffickers have been key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments on the matter.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers defectors to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees, and they are often repatriated.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on denuclearization negotiations.
This came after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, who broadly agreed to work for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress.
“Without U.S. confidence, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will by no means be the first to unilaterally disarm,” Ri said in a speech to the U.N. General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi Calls Brett Kavanaugh 'Hysterical' and Says He's Unfit to Serve on Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was a "hysterical" and unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t help but think that if a woman had acted that way, they would have said she’s hysterical,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh used emotion to deny allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when the two were teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, at times almost screaming and choking as he talked about his family and his high school years.
At the committee, he also explicitly condemned the Democrats, calling the allegations against him “grotesque and clearly coordinated defamation” staged by some angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that, in her opinion, Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court, because it showed his bias against Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with those statements with and the way he has persecuted the Clintons and the Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi raised her objections when asked if she would impeach Kavanaugh in the event he was confirmed in office and the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
“If he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he won’t be fit not only to be on the Supreme Court, he won’t even be fit to be in the court he’s in now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the Washington D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh’s possible sentences against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, as he is considered to be a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
“This is not the time for a hysterical, unbiased person to go to court and expect us to think everything is okay,” Pelosi said.
And women have to hold it.
It’s a justified diatribe, it’s months and years of fury overflowing, and she can’t let go without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's that weird, do you?"
She continued: “I was really helped by a woman who was an executive at some company and who told me that she also cried when she got angry, but that she had developed a technique where when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, ‘Maybe you think I’m sad because I’m crying.
No, I'm angry."
And then he kept doing what he was doing.
I thought it was great.”
Tears are allowed as a way out for rabies in part because they are basically not well understood.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs, in a male-dominated office, was once when I found myself crying with inexpressible rage. An older woman, a serious manager of whom I had always had a slight fear, grabbed me by the neck and dragged me up a ladder.
“Don’t ever let them see you cry,” he said.
"They have no idea you're angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll be happy because they think they’ve cornered you.”
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential runs.
In 1987, when Hart was caught on an extramarital affair aboard a ship called Monkey Business for which she had to retire from the presidential race, it occurred to Schroeder, deeply frustrated, that there was no reason not to explore the idea of her running for president herself.
“It wasn’t a well-planned decision,” he told me with a laugh 30 years later.
“There were already seven candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was one more candidate.
Someone referred to us as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
As the campaign was already well advanced, he was left behind in fundraising, so he was promised that he would not re-enter the race unless he raised $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to the men, only gave $250 to her.
“Do you think I have a discount?” he asked.
When she gave her speech announcing that she would not have a formal campaign, she was so overcome by emotions (gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration over a system that made it difficult to raise funds and that focused on attracting voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism) that she choked.
“The logical thing would have been to think that he had had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder said, recalling the reaction from the press.
“You might have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my headstone?
“Did he cry?”
US-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The first salvos in the U.S.-China trade war were deafening, and while much remains to be done, a break between the countries could benefit Beijing, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by placing tariffs on major Chinese exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) in goods, taxing half of goods entering the United States from China.
On every occasion, Beijing has retaliated with the equivalent of five to 10 percent tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods.
China has pledged to match U.S. attacks, and the world’s second most powerful economy is unlikely to slacken anytime soon.
Getting Washington to back down would mean giving in to the demands, but publicly submitting to the United States would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Still, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards right, the pressures of the U.S. trade war could positively help China in the long run by reducing interdependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick policy decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions to start a plummeting economy in either country is actually much more dangerous than viewers have recognized so far,” said Abigail Grace, an Asia-focused research associate at the Center for New American Security.
Syria ready for return of refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild a country ravaged by a war that has been raging for more than seven years.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the country’s conditions were improving.
"The situation on the ground is now more stable and secure thanks to the progress that has been made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by the terrorists in an attempt to restore normalcy.
All the conditions for the voluntary return to the country of refugees who had to leave the country due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and livelihoods are already in place.
The UN estimates that since the war began in 2011, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country.
There are another six million people still living in the country and in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem acknowledged that the Syrian regime would appreciate help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he also stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that promoted the insurgency.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the North American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, on the outskirts of Paris (France).
The U.S. now carries six straight losses on European soil since the last time it won a Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn achieved the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
North American star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight for most of the tournament, threw his starting point into the water on the 16th par 3 hole, thus admitting his defeat to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari stood out in all his rounds, becoming one of four players who have never achieved a 5-0-0 since the current tournament format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth lost 5-4 to the European team's lowest-ranked player, Thorbjorn Olesen.
World No. 1 Dustin Johnson fell 2-1 to England's Ian Poulter, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
Sergio Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a, a veteran of eight Ryder Cups, became the European with the most victories of the tournament of all time, with 25.5 points in his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help it.
It's been a very hard year.
I am totally grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am very, very happy that I was able to get the cup back.
It is an achievement of the whole team and I am very happy to have been able to help," said an excited Garcia after the victory of the European team.
Now he passes the torch to his compatriot John Rahm, who already defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2-1 in a singles match on Sunday.
“I’m incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods as I’ve grown to see this man,” said 23-year-old golfer John Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in his Ryder Cup career.
This is a strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles, trailing only Jack Nicklaus.
The American team had to fight all weekend to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team’s disappointing performance: “I’m very proud of these guys, they’ve never stopped fighting.
There was a moment this morning when we warmed up the situation in Europe.
But we screwed it up.
I want to congratulate Thomas.
He's a great captain.
His 12 players have played a very good game.
We will regroup, meet with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and move forward.
I love these 12 guys very much and I am proud to be their captain.
Now we have to bow our heads.
They have overtaken us.”
