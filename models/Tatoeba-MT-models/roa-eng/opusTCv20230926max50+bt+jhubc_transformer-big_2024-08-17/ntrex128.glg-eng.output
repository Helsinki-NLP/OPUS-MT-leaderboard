Members of the Assembly of Wales are concerned "to be taken for puppets"
Dismay among some of the members of the Assembly, currently known in English as AM, at the suggestion that they should change their name to MWP (Member of Parliament for Wales).
The debate stemmed from plans to change the name of the assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly from all over the world are afraid of being ridiculed.
One Labour Party member said his group was concerned that the new name "rhymes with Twp and with Pwp".
For those who don't know Welsh, "twp" means "fool" and "pwp" means "poo".
A member of the Plaid Cymru party stated that the group as a whole was "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh conservative said his group was "open-minded" about the name change, but noted that from MWP to Muppet there was only a small verbal leap.
In this context, the letter "w" in Welsh is pronounced similarly to the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter "u".
The Assembly Committee, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, stated: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptor of the members of the Assembly will depend on the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on these proposals which showed strong support for the name of the Parliament of Wales.
With regard to the AM title issue, the commission preferred members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but the MWP option received majority support in a public consultation.
AMs seem to be suggesting alternatives, but the struggle to reach consensus could prove a headache for President Elin Jones, who is expected to hand over the bill on the changes in a few weeks.
The law on reforms will include other changes in the functioning of the assembly, such as the rules on disqualification of MPs and the design of the committee system.
AMs will get the final vote on what they should be called when debating the legislation.
Macedonians go to the polls in referendum to change the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday if they change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote will decide to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbour's name represents a claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed its applications for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who in the plebiscite opposes the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is no longer at the price that must be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin remain silent as the churches of Harlem continue to fight.
“The elders I spoke with said there was a bar and a church on every corner before,” Mr. Adams said.
“Nowadays, neither one nor the other.”
He said he could understand that the bars had disappeared.
“Now people socialize in other ways,” he said.
“Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhoods that people usually go to.”
As for the churches, he fears that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as leaders expect, and “sooner or later they will return to where they began.”
He added that churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with communities of owners filled with the kind of people who would not help neighborhoods remain sanctuaries.
“The vast majority of the people who will buy the apartments in these buildings will be white,” he declared, “and therefore they will speed up the closing of all these churches, because the new owners are unlikely to become members of these churches.”
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis, metropolitan community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved in the 1930s.
A nearby black congregation took possession of the building.
St. Martin was occupied by a black congregation led by the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the shops on 125th Street, a shopping street in Harlem that resisted hiring and promoting black people.
A fire in 1939 left the building badly damaged, but as Father Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild it, they commissioned the carillon.
The Rev. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin, proudly christened the carillon "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played the carillon in July called it another way: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also noted that it was the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who changed it for the larger carillon of Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that no one took his place at St. Martin.
Those who have occupied St. Martin in recent months are a group of architects and contractors, some led by lay church leaders and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parish council, the governing body of the parish and made up of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July expressing concern that the latter "intends to pass on the costs" to the council, even though the latter had not participated in the hiring of the architects and contractors it sent to the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark Kills Boy While Fishing for Lobsters in California
Police said a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while spearfishing for lobsters in California on the first day of that crustacean’s season.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help, at which point he swam with a group of people to help get him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was just excitement to catch a lobster, but that he later realized that he was shouting "I've been caught!
They caught me!”
He had a broken collarbone." Hammel said he noticed it when he came to the boy.
"I beat everyone who came out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" Hammel added.
The boy was flown by helicopter to Rady Children’s Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is not known.
Rescuer Captain Larry Giles told a news conference that they had spotted a shark in the area a few weeks ago, but had determined it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic damage to the upper torso.
Officials closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach, in Casablad, to Swami's, in Ecinitas, for 48 hours to undertake an investigation and also for security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty runners similar to department stores full of specialist assistants.
As part of the UK’s <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow as sales of fashion and home products plummet, the biggest corridors with beauty products will be tested in 11 stores across the country, and then move on to others next year if they succeed.
The investment in beauty comes at a time when supermarkets are looking to fill the shelves that once occupied televisions, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury's said it would double its beauty product offering to 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The current collections of L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also get more space with exclusive zones similar to those that can be seen in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique makeup range so that most products are suitable for vegans, something increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, The Fragrance Shop will test concessions at two Sainsbury’s establishments; the first opened in Croydon, South London, last week, while the second will open at Selly Oak, Birmingham, this year.
Online shopping and a shift that translates into buying small amounts of food daily in small stores means supermarkets have to do more to convince people to visit.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said the stores will increasingly look like shopping centres as supermarket chains try to compete with discount stores such as Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has already introduced Argos and Habitat outlets into hundreds of stores, having bought the two chains two years ago. This has apparently bolstered grocery sales and made the acquisitions profitable.
The supermarket’s previous attempt to modernize its pharmacy and beauty departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's launched a joint initiative with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership came to an end after a dispute over how to distribute pharmacy revenues to their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
It was reported that Lloyds would participate in the plan by adding a wide range of luxury cosmetics brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy to 4 stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Chief Commercial Officer of Sainsbury’s, said: “We have transformed the image of our beauty runners to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invest in specially trained staff who can be reached for advice.
Our range of products is designed to fit every need and the attractive and practical locations mean we are now a cosmetic destination that challenges old shopping habits.”
Peter Jones 'furious' after Holly Willoughby pulls out of <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
"Dragons Den" star Peter Jones has left "furious" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of an <0xC2><0xA3>11 million lifestyle business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for his brand of homewear and accessories Truly.
His company had been compared to Goop, the brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old This Morning host used Instagram to announce her farewell.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons' Den star Peter Jones sparking as she retired from her lifestyle brand at the last minute to focus on her new gold contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources indicate that Jones was "furious" when the TV golden girl admitted during a tense meeting held Saturday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new business ventures, valued at <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million, meant she no longer had time to devote to the brand of homewear and accessories of both, Truly.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop and was predicted to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, took to Instagram to announce he was leaving Truly, Jones flew to Britain and headed to one of his vacation residences.
A source said: "Truly was by far one of Holly's priorities.
It was to be their long-term future for the next two decades.
His decision to leave stunned everyone involved in the project.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to launch.
There was a warehouse full of merchandise in Marlow's offices ready to sell."
Experts believe that the abandonment of the This Morning presenter is among the most profitable stars in Britain could cost the company millions of pounds, due to the considerable investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and textiles for the home, and that it could delay its launch even further.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are parents to three children and have been close friends with Jones and his wife, Tara, for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The couples went on vacation together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will go on to become an M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as a host on ITV’s I’m a Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night that "we should not comment on his business affairs".
A complicated conversation "and then we fell in love"
He toyed with the criticism he would receive from the media for making a comment that some would consider "uncharacteristic of a president" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said he was using his voice as a “television presenter.”
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He said Kim is interested in holding a second meeting after his initial meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump sees as a big step toward denuclearizing North Korea.
Negotiations for denuclearization have stalled.
More than three pesos after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that the North does not see the "corresponding response" by the U.S. to North Korea's first disarmament measures.
On the contrary, he stressed, the US continues to impose sanctions aimed at continuing to exert pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic view in his rally speech.
“Things are going well with North Korea,” he said.
“We’re going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We have a great relationship now.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results: ending missile tests, helping to free the hostages and bringing the remaining U.S. soldiers home.
And he defended his unusual strategy by talking about relations with Kim.
“It’s very easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out trying to get into this amphitheater, we would have about 200 people standing here,” Trump said.
An earthquake and tsunami devastated an island in Indonesia, killing hundreds of people.
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that they did not need them.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population was displaced, no national disaster was declared, which is an indispensable condition for catalyzing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they will not be requesting international aid, so it is a challenge," Ms Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is assembling a team to travel to Palu, it is still unclear whether the foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster management agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies could contribute their help.
Given the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly enduring, the country is woefully ill-prepared to face the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, it is not common to find them on other coasts.
Although an alert had been issued, the absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu likely contributed to the loss of life.
At best, travelling between many of Indonesia’s islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that had been deployed in Lombok to care for earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to arrive at the site of the new calamity.
President Joko Widodo's election campaign revolved around improving Indonesia's deteriorating infrastructure, and lavished money on roads and railways.
But Mr. Joko’s administration is plagued by a huge lack of funds in the run-up to next year’s re-election.
Mr. Joko is also affected by continuing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative way of living the faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were forced from their homes because of street clashes between Christian and Muslim gangs, who use machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scores a goal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea with an 89th-minute goal on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while still about 27 yards from Chelsea's goal with his team losing 1–0.
He touched the ball with his left leg before throwing a shot at the second stick.
The ball flew over the area as it advanced towards the upper left corner of the net.
The ball ended up falling on a Kepa Arrizabalaga that jumped in the air and entering the net.
"I was just trying to get to that position, to get organized, and players like Shaq always play the ball forward as much as possible, so I tried to win as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I came over to Kante and they gave a touch without thinking too much and I just shot.”
Chelsea won 1-0 at halftime after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blues forward passed the heel ball to Mateo Kovacic on that play, before turning around near the halfway mark and running into Liverpool's field.
Kovacic made a wall in the center of the field.
He made a beautiful in-depth pass leading Hazard into the area.
Hazard overcame the defense and ended up on the second stick scoring with a left-handed shot that Alisson Becker was unable to stop.
Liverpool face Napoli in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3pm at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will do the same with Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3pm in London.
Death toll from Indonesia tsunami rises to 832
The death toll from the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the national disaster management agency said on Sunday morning.
Many people would be trapped among the rubble of buildings that collapsed in the 7.5-magnitude earthquake that struck on Friday and caused waves of up to 6 meters, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said in a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is covered with rubble from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of murder after woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has opened after the body of a woman was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds in John Street, and a 32-year-old man suspected of murder was arrested.
Police asked people in the area who had seen or heard something to step forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is in its early stages, but I would like to call for anyone who has been in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead to contact us who has seen or heard anything suspicious.
“I would also like to ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, to capture anything with the dash cam to contact us as they may have key information for our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the body found belongs to a neighbor from Birkenhead and that it was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who thought they knew the woman arrived on the scene to answer questions about where she was that morning.
The investigation continues as police say they are in the process of informing the victim’s closest family members.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to get back to his apartment, but police have informed him that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
The man was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents have been told they won’t be able to return for more than a few hours.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the area is considered a crime scene.
There is a woman on stage crying.
He doesn’t say, “It’s horrible.”
At 2 p.m. there were two police vans inside the cordon with another van just outside.
Several officers remain inside the cordon guarding the apartment block.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 quoting record 247 of September 30.
Cromwell's statue of parliament becomes last monument affected by fight to 'rewrite history'
Their prohibition would be poetic justice for their Taliban destruction of so many of England's religious and cultural objects carried out by their fanatical and Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's suggestion "shotgun" and "trying to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate over the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps they would have sacrificed to the wrong Cromwell for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent depiction of Cromwell is a proof of 19th-century opinion, and part of the historiography of a figure many consider to still deserve homage.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than now, as the defender of parliament in the face of external pressure, in this case, of course, it was the monarchy.
Whether or not this is a fully complete representation is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is clear is that the conflict of the mid-17th century defined the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure who represents one side of the divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration."
A Chinese farmer is killed by a pig.
According to local media, a pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwest China.
Last Sunday, the South China Morning Post reported that the man, identified only by his surname, "Yuan," was found dead with a severed artery and covered in blood near a cortege in Liupanshui market in Guizhou province.
A pig farmer prepares to put vaccines to pigs in a shed on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He had apparently traveled with his cousin on Wednesday from neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door leading to another adjacent stall.
He said that in the cortello there was a large male with blood in his mouth.
The forensic analysis confirmed that the pig, weighing almost 250 kilos, attacked the farmer to the point of killing him.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and broken,” the cousin, surnamed “Wu,” told the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while police gathered evidence on stage.
It appears that Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although they are not very common, there have been cases of pigs attacking humans before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on the couple’s Massachusetts farm, causing serious injury to the man.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing almost 300 kilos had cornered a Welsh farmer against the tractor until his wife arrived and frightened the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was devoured by his own pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs don’t tend to be aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as “triggering.”
“They’re just playing.
They are like children, very curious... they have no intention of doing harm.
You just have to respect them,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy and widespread rains to the southwest U.S.
Forecasts indicate that Hurricane Rosa weakens as it flies over the cold waters of Mexico's northern coast.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains to northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S. over the next few days.
At 5 a.m. on Sunday, Eastern Time, Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane with winds of more than 135 km/h and was located about 620 kilometers from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to head north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a valley begins to take shape over the Pacific Ocean and move eastward toward the U.S. East Coast. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to push tropical moisture northward, which will penetrate the southwestern U.S.
Rosa will bring more than 250 l/m2 of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Next, the interaction of tropical moisture with the valley will create abundant and widespread rainfall in the southwest in the coming days.
At the local level, rainfall of between 25 and 100 l/m2 will cause dangerous flash floods, debris flows and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
Tropical high humidity will cause rainfall approaching 50 to 75 l/m2 in occasional areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In parts of the Southwest, 50 to 100 l/m2 of rain is expected, especially over much of Arizona.
Possibility of sudden flooding with deteriorating conditions due to the dispersed nature of tropical rain.
We strongly advise against venturing into the desert under threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains could form canyons that could become floating rivers, and thunderstorms will bring locally gusty winds and dust.
The flood will bring locally heavy rains to parts of the Southern California coast.
Total rainfall could reach more than 12 l/m2, which in turn could cause minor debris flow and slippery roads.
These would be the first rains of the wet season in the region.
Scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona in the late hours of Sunday and early Monday, before the rain spreads late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will arrive at Four Corners on Tuesday, which will last until Wednesday.
October will witness large temperature swings in the U.S. due to the cooling of the Arctic, although the tropics will remain quite warm.
Sometimes this involves significant temperature changes over short distances.
On Sunday we will be able to see a great example of drastic differences in temperature in the center of the United States.
There will be a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the persistent summer heat will try to reappear and expand again.
For the central and eastern part of the country, a warm beginning of October is expected, with temperatures that will exceed 26 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
New York could reach 26 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates high probabilities of above-average temperatures for the east of the country during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have seen Brett Kavanaugh's trial
More than 20 million people followed on six television channels the passionate testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, political gridlock continues and the networks interrupt their usual programming for a late-night Friday news: a deal designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he is 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh touched him while drunk and that he tried to take his clothes off at a high school party.
In a passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said he was absolutely certain that this had not happened.
Nielsen reported on Friday that more than 20.4 million people would have seen it.
The company counted the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available to other broadcasters, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has trouble measuring people who watch television from offices.
To get an idea, it is an audience similar to a football final or the Oscars ceremony.
Fox News Channel, which strongly supported Kavanaugh’s nomination, led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during a trial that lasted all day, according to Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94, MSNBC 2.89 and CNN 2.52 million according to Nielsen.
After the trial, interest continued.
Flake was the central figure of Friday on television.
After the moderate Republican's office made a statement indicating that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught on CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning being booed by protesters as he tried to get into an elevator on the way to the Judiciary Committee hearing.
He kept his eyes down for several minutes while he was reprimanded, televised live on CNN.
“I’m standing in front of you,” one woman said.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?”
They said to him, "You have power while there are many helpless women."
Flake said that his office made a statement Flake, before the elevator was closed, added that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
All television and cable networks broadcast live hours later when the Judiciary Committee had to vote to advance Kavanaugh's nomination before the full Senate to be put to a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations against the nominee the following week, which a minority of Democrats urged.
Flake was convinced in part by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a subsequent conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's election had power, because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
UK PM accuses critics of ‘playing politics’ with Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and of harming the national interest.
Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with her on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, insisted on attacking May’s so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying the proposal that Britain and the EU should levy tariffs on the other side was “totally absurd”.
Wayde Sims Murdered: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson as Suspect in LSU Player's Death
Police arrested a suspect in the shooting that killed Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
According to the Baton Rouge Police Department, Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and jailed on a second-degree murder charge.
Officers broadcast the video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and police said Sims had lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the scene and claimed they contained Simpson's DNA, CBS affiliate WAFB reports.
After questioning Simpson, police said he admitted to being the shooter who killed Wayde.
The defense said he was fined $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office issued a preliminary report Friday indicating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head that had reached the neck.
The department praised the Louisiana State Police's fugitive unit, the state police's crime lab, and Southern University police for helping to secure the arrest.
LSU sporting director Joe Alleva thanked local law enforcement for their "diligence and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2.01 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade stated that the team was "downcast" and "shocked" by Wayde's passing.
“That’s what we’re worried about all the time,” Wade said.
Volcano casts ash over Mexico City
The ash thrown by the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday advised Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after activity was detected in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded in 24 hours.
The center was monitoring several rumblings and tremors.
Social media images showed thin layers of ash on windshields in Mexico City neighborhoods such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have detected an increase in the activity of the volcano located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of anniversary of independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police and as thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarising vote on Catalonia's secession.
A group of masked pro-separatists held by riot police threw eggs and powder paint at them, creating clouds of dark dust in the streets that are often crowded with tourists.
There were also later refreshments that day with the police, who used the batons to contain the feud.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanting "Ni olvido ni perd<0xC3><0xB3>n" (Neither forgetfulness nor forgiveness) confronted unionist demonstrators who shouted "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people had to be treated for minor injuries received at the protest, according to local media.
Tensions continue in the separatist region a year after the October 1 referendum held by Catalan separatists, although considered illegal by Madrid.
Voters overwhelmingly opted for independence, although turnout was low and anti-secessionists boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations across the region in violent clashes.
The pro-independence groups camped all night on Friday to avoid a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place in the same way, but they were forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who attended the independence rally with his wife, said he no longer had any hope of Catalonia achieving independence.
“Last year was one of our best days.
“I saw my parents cry for joy at being able to vote, but now we are stuck,” he said.
Despite securing a close, if decisive, victory in last December’s regional elections, this year the pro-independence Catalan parties struggled to maintain momentum, with many of their best-known leaders in self-imposed exile or detained pending trial for their participation in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who was recording the rally in support of police with his mobile phone, said the conflict had been fuelled by politicians on both sides.
“There’s more and more tension,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since last year, announced that he would stand for election to the European Parliament the following year.
“To stand as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression that we have suffered from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Man Arrested After Car Hits House
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car rammed into a Londonderry home on several occasions.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19:30 (summer time in Britain).
Police Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings declared the latticework and the building itself were the damaged parts.
It’s also possible that you may have fired a shot at the car at some point.
Menga's goal gives Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ended in victory
The promoted Livingston surprised the Rangers by leading Steven Gerrard to his second loss in 18 games as Ibrox club manager.
Dolly Menga's goal was decisive for Gary Holt's team to move up one level after Hibernian, in second position.
Gerrard's side are still unbeaten away from home this year in the Premiership and next Sunday face the leader, the Hearts, from which they are separated by eight points.
But first the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston remain unbeaten in the division for a sixth straight game; head coach Holt has not yet known defeat since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses opportunities in front of debilitated visitors
Holt's team had to advance well before the moment they scored, as their control caused all sorts of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson made his way but his crossfire did not cross the goal threshold; then Alan Lithgow's shot came off driven by a header from Craig Halkett from the other side of the goal.
The host team was content to let the Rangers play in front of them, aware that they could endanger the visitors in the standing ball games.
That’s how the final goal came about.
The Rangers conceded a free kick and Livingston made a serve in which Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined their efforts to secure Menga, who touched the ball and scored from the center of the area.
At the time the Rangers dominated possession but had come up against an impenetrable defense that prevented much work for goalkeeper Liam Kelly.
That pattern continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a stop by Kelly.
Rangers goaltender Allan McGregor footed a shot from Scott Pittman, and Lithgow sent the ball off in another walk from Livingston.
Many crossover passes were played in the Livingston area that were continuously cleared, while two penalty requests were rejected: one per hand and one for a Halkett entry to substitute Glenn Middleton.
'Phenomenal' by Livingston: analysis
Alasdair Lamont for BBC Scotland from Tony Macaroni Stadium
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
“They were excellent and continue to exceed expectations on their upward trajectory.
His playing style and players have hardly changed since returning to the top flight, but part of the credit goes to Holt for the way he has driven the team since his arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Halkett, the captain, superbly led a perfectly organized defense while Menga gave Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall no respite throughout the game.
The Rangers lacked inspiration.
Despite working well on occasion under Gerrard's orders, this time they did not reach that level.
The last pass failed. They only managed to penetrate the host team once. A whole advance call to the Rangers, which is in the middle of the table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an receives an ambiguous reception in Cologne
On Saturday 29 September there were smiles and blue skies during the meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany for lunch in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to fix relations between NATO allies.
They disagreed on many issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to inaugurate a gigantic new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police claimed security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters of Erdogan came to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters (many of them Kurds) also raised their voices condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The duel of demonstrations reflects the division before a visitor hailed as a hero by some German Turks and criticized as autocrat by others.
Traffic accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies when colliding with a car
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, around 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped and the paramedics arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The crash comes months after another cyclist was killed in a runaway car on Childers Street just over a mile from Saturday’s crash.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
There are street closures and buses have been diverted and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Jail: Six Officers Injured in Riots
Six prison officers were injured in an altercation in the high-security prison, according to the prison official.
The riot started at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 09:30 hours (summer time in Britain) on Sunday and still continues.
A "Tornado" unit of specialized officers came to deal with the riots, involving eight inmates who are contained in a ward.
Officers received attention for minor injuries to the face.
A prison service spokesman said: "Prison staff have been deployed specially trained to deal with an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six members of staff had to be treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we are clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and could spend more time behind bars.”
HMP Long Lartin holds more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the director of the prison had to be hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot officials had to go to jail to quell an uprising in which staff were beaten with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with flash flooding (drought-hit places could benefit)
It is rare for a tropical depression to affect Arizona, but it is very likely to occur early next week, when the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa crosses the Southwest Desert leaving the possibility of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to pass directly over Phoenix on Tuesday and arrive late on Monday with rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service said in a Twitter post that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained depression or tropical storm status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that extended within a 40-mile radius of the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Weather Service forecast 50 to 10 l/m2 of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 150 l/m2 in Arizona's Bordo Mogoll<0xC3><0xB3>n.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert, such as the Central Rockies and the Great Basin could reach up to 25 or 50 liters, with isolated totals of 100 l/m2 being possible.
For those who are out of danger of flash floods, the Rosa rain could be a blessing, as the region is heavily affected by droughts.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of this rain may be beneficial, as the Southwest is experiencing droughts.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second-largest category.
First, Hurricane Rosa will make landfall on Mexico’s Baja California peninsula.
Rosa, which will still have hurricane strength on Sunday morning, with a maximum wind speed of 136 km/h, is 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is heading north at 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm is encountering cold water in the Pacific and is therefore losing strength.
For this reason, it is expected to make landfall in Mexico with tropical storm force on Monday afternoon or night.
It could rain heavily in some areas of Mexico, posing a significant risk of flooding.
"Total precipitation of between 75 and 150 l/m2 is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with up to 250 l/m2 possible," reports weather.com.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico in the form of a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday as a tropical depression and then continue up through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The main danger from Rosa or what remains of it is heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the Southwest U.S. Desert," the National Hurricane Center reported.
These rains are expected to cause sudden waterspouts and debris flows in deserts, and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder in order to find a 16-year-old boy with stab wounds.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday around 4 a.m.
He was taken to the hospital, where he remains "stable".
According to Somerset police, three boys aged 17, 18 and 20 were arrested in the Radstock area during the night.
The officers asked for the collaboration of anyone who had a recording on the cell phone of the incident.
Trump says Kavanaugh 'suffered the pettiness and anger' of the Democratic Party
“To vote for Judge Kavanaugh is to vote to reject the merciless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered the pettiness and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, where he categorically and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford’s allegation that he sexually assaulted her decades ago as a teenager.
Ford also testified at the trial about his accusation.
The president said Saturday that on that day "Americans" witnessed Kavanaugh's brilliance, quality and courage.
“A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the best jurists of our time with a record of unimpaired public service,” he said.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment while speaking of the importance of Republican results in the midterm elections.
“It’s five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I don’t do it, but I really do,” he said.
"That's why I'm going everywhere fighting for great candidates."
Trump has argued that the Democrats’ mission is to “oppose and hinder.”
The first procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected to take place before Friday, a Republican aide told CNN.
Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami kill hundreds of people and the number continues to rise
Authorities said Saturday that at least 384 people were killed, many of them washed up by giant waves that broke on beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday to attend a festival on the beach in the town of Palu when waves of up to six meters broke on land in the dark, taking the lives of many and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami followed a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
“Yesterday, when the threat arose, people were still carrying out their activities on the beach and did not immediately flee, so they were killed,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia’s disaster mitigation agency BNPB, told a press conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, it dragged cars, logs, houses, it wiped out everything it could find,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had travelled offshore at a speed of 800 km/h (500 mph) before reaching the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and managed to survive, he said.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the national disaster management agency showed many shops and buildings destroyed, bridges twisted and torn down, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The aftershocks continued to rock the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes were felt in an area with 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, sitting at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have magnified the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "quantifying" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho announced that casualties and damage could be greater along the northern coast of Palu, an area called Donggala that is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
The communications were "totally paralyzed and there is no information" from Donggala, Nugroho added.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
“This is a tragedy, but it could be much worse,” he said.
The agency was harshly criticized on Saturday for failing to report the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived by the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur recording shared on social media, a man on the top floor of a building can be heard shouting frantically warning of the arrival of a tsunami to people on the street.
In a matter of minutes, the water hits the waterfront leading to buildings and cars.
Reuters was not able to immediately certify the authenticity of the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major blackout that cut communications across Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Authorities say the army has already begun sending cargo aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, but evacuees continue to be in urgent need of food and other basic necessities.
The airport has been reopened, but only for relief work, and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the Palu evacuation centers on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami is over 800.
It's terrible.
During the journey that the World Vision staff made to reach the city of Palu, where the employees are sheltered in canvas shelters erected in the courtyard of their office, they saw scenes of total devastation, said Mr. Doseba.
“They told me they saw many houses destroyed,” he said.
It's terrible.
Even as the groups began the unpleasant task of setting up disaster assistance, some complained that they were preventing foreign aid workers with extensive knowledge and experience from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, funds, supplies and staffing from abroad can only flow if the disaster site is declared a national disaster area.
And that hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the level of a province,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says, ‘Okay, this is a national disaster,’ we can open up to international aid, but that time has not yet come.”
As the second night in Palu fell after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, family and friends of the missing held on to the hope that their loved ones would be one of the miracles that eased the depressing argument from natural disasters.
On Saturday, they took a child out of a sinkhole.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been under the rubble for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, head coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which concluded earlier this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagi added that some of the people trapped in the Roa Roa hotel were his students.
“As a person with extensive experience in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional charge,” he said.
Gendon recounted how, in the hours after news of the Roa Roa hotel collapse broke among the paragliding community, he had desperately tried to send WhatsApp messages to Palu competitors, who were participating in the beach festival.
However, only one gray mark was shown in the messages instead of two blue marks.
“I think that means the messages haven’t been delivered,” he added.
$26,750 stolen while charging a cashier in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, robbers stole $26,750 from a Brink worker who was charging a cashier in Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport police department news release.
In the press release, investigating officer Dennis McCarthy wrote that the driver of the car had emptied a cashier in the leisure complex and was preparing to hand over more money.
While he was busy, another man "came running from behind Brink's clerk" and stole from him a bag of money that he had to deliver.
According to the note, witnesses saw several suspects abandoned the scene, but the police did not specify how many were involved in the incident.
If you have information about their identities, contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
To announce the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "Being formerly known as Kanye West".
For some time now, the 41-year-old West has been known by the moniker Ye, which he used as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change came ahead of her appearance on Saturday Night Live, where she is expected to release her new album Yandhi.
She will replace singer Ariana Grande on the show, who canceled her attendance for "emotional reasons," according to the show's creator.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had previously explained that the word had a religious meaning to him.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you,’” West had said that same year while talking about his record with radio host Big Boy.
“So I am you, it is us, it is us.
I went from Kanye, which means the only one, to only Ye, which is a reflection of the goodness in us, of evil, of confusion, of everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
Kanye is one of the famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs was formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, although this year he announced that he prefers to call him Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, JAY-Z, also managed to put and remove the script and use the capitals.
AMLO pledges not to use military against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has pledged not to use military force against civilians again as the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students approaches.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador vowed Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that he would "no longer use the military to repress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, troops fired on a peaceful demonstration in the plaza killing about 300 people at a time when student movements were taking root throughout Latin America.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has promised to support Mexican youth by giving monthly grants to the boys who study and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities drags kids into criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its investment in A.I.
According to AI investor and professional Kai-Fu Lee, a former employee of Google, Microsoft and Apple, the U.S. should double the amount it invests in AI in view of China’s growing activity in the field.
The comments came after several parts of the U.S. government made announcements about AI, even if the U.S. lacks a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan the previous year: it aims to be number 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
“Double the budget on AI research would be a good start, given that the other countries are much further behind than the U.S., and we are looking for the next big breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
Doubling the funding could double the odds that the next AI achievement would be made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s most prominent AI companies: Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the highest-scoring American Othello player and subsequently became an executive at Microsoft Research of Google's subsidiary in China.
Lee recognized former U.S. government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotic Challenge and asked when it would be next to help identify the next visionaries.
In the U.S., researchers often have to work hard to get government grants, Lee says.
“China is not leading academic leaders, but companies,” he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired university geniuses to work on AI.
Lee stressed that changing immigration policy could also help the U.S. boost its AI efforts.
“I think they should offer residency cards to AI doctors,” he said.
The State Council of China published its Next-Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to individuals from academic institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established an Artificial Intelligence Center that is intended to include industry and university partners, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Information.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation seeking to create a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has not registered movement for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country.
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday in a referendum to change their name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece and block applications for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbors represents a claim on its territory and has vetoed its membership in NATO and the EU.
The governments of the two countries reached an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents allege that the change would harm the ethnic identity of the majority of Macedonia's Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has raised doubts about whether the result will reach the minimum 50 percent needed for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum ballot was: "Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU by accepting the agreement with Greece?"
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to gain admission to entities such as the EU or NATO Macedonia, one of the countries emerging from the fall of Yugoslavia.
"Today I came to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, several members of parliament said they would abide by the result of the vote and make it final.
The change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said no irregularities had been reported at 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters cast their vote.
“I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter from the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko cast their vote for the Macedonian referendum on changing the name of the country that would pave the way for its accession to the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of the tents set up for those who boycotted the referendum.
“We are in favor of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to do it with our heads held high and not through the service door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t accept us as Macedonia, we can go to other countries like China and Russia and join the Eurasian Union.”
Prime Minister Zaev claims that NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
“I think the overwhelming majority will be in favor because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favor of joining the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said a positive outcome would be the “confirmation of our future.”
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research revealed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, a figure that is below the required.
Another poll by the Macedonian television network Telma indicated that 57 percent of those polled planned to go to the polls on Sunday.
Seventy percent said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the result must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure in the referendum would represent the first major blow to the pro-Western government's policy since it came to power in May.
Manchester City player Sergio Ag<0xC3><0xBC>ero crosses Brighton’s entire defence and ends up scoring a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling reported Brighton's 2-0 defence to Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it seem ridiculously simple to score the 65th-minute goal.
The Argentine forward received a midfield pass at the start of the sequence.
He ran between three Brighton defences before heading out into the open.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He got rid of one defence before overtaking several more at the edge of the Brighton area.
Then he passed the ball to his left and found Sterling.
The English striker used the first touch in the area to return the ball to Aguero, who hit Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot to the right of the net.
"Aguero is going through some problems in the foot," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We played 55 or 60 minutes.
And that’s when it happened.
We were lucky that he scored at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Blues an early lead in the Premier League matchup.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Ag<0xC3><0xBC>ero received the ball in the depth of Brighton's field that play.
He sent a beautiful hollow pass down the right lane to Leroy Sane.
Sane gave several touches before driving Sterling to the opposing post.
The bluebirds put the ball in the goal before leaving the field.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to throw a party for the Rockies
With the Nationals out of the playoffs, there wasn't much reason to force another start.
But an ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to pitch Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still qualifier implications for the Rockies, who lead the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West.
The Rockies secured at least one wild-card position with a 5–2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still trying to close out their first-division title.
“Although we didn’t play anything, at least we can play the rubber knowing that the atmosphere in Denver with the crowd and the other team would probably play at the highest level I played this year.
“Why don’t I want to compete?”
The Nationals have not yet announced who the starter will be on Sunday, but they seem inclined to let Scherzer pitch in a situation like that.
Scherzer, for whom it would be his 34th start, did another bullpen session on Thursday and will probably pitch on Sunday on his usual rest day.
Washington's right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds rally in West Virginia
The president has indirectly referred to the situation surrounding Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, while speaking of the importance of the outcome in the midterm elections.
“We did everything we did in November.
Five weeks until one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is a big, big thing... I don’t compete, but I really do and that’s why I go everywhere fighting for great candidates,” he said.
Trump went on to say, “You see this horrible radical group of Democrats, look what’s happening now.
And they are determined to regain power using any means necessary, meanness, and meanness.
They don’t care who they hurt, over who they have to go through to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control and we’re never going to give it to them.”
The mission of the Democrats is to oppose and hinder.”
“And they’ve seen it the last four days,” he said, calling Democrats “angry, boastful, disgusting, and liars.”
He listed the Senate Judiciary Committee by quoting Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, which received loud applause from the public.
“Do you remember his answer?
Did you filter the document?
Mmm..ejem, what?
No, no, no, wait... It was the worst body language, the worst I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party is no longer open.
They are not tolerant of those who express their opinion.
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, the truth is that I was not too surprised.
After all, they are the latest in a series of Labour MPs who are not well received, and all for saying our opinion.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way because she stood up decisively to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
on the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security and on Europe, issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notification for Friday's Nottingham East Labour meeting stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of the eight years I have been a Labour MP, Friday night committee meetings have been exactly like this.
Unfortunately, that’s no longer the tone of many meetings, and the promise of a “kinder and kinder” policy has long since been forgotten, if it ever began.
It is becoming increasingly clear that the Labour Party does not tolerate differing views and is judged on whether all views are acceptable to the party leader.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader of the party, when comrades with whom he believed he shared a similar political vision began to expect him to portray me and adopt positions with which he would never agree, whether on national security or the EU’s single market.
When I speak publicly, and really no matter what I say, there is a tremendous uproar and attacks on social media censoring centrist politics, telling me I shouldn’t be in the Labour party.
And it doesn’t just happen to me.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, as the comments addressed to me tend to be of a political nature.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist comments every day and who do not give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how levels of insult have been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party had to foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer so open and that with every move of "no confidence" or every change in the rules of selection, the party becomes more narrow-minded.
Over the past few years I have received many advices that urge me to keep my head down, not to be so frank and that then “everything would be fine for me”.
I didn’t get into politics to do that.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago while still in school, driven by the Thatcher government’s neglect to drop my classroom, I have tried to call for better public services for those who need them most, both as a local councillor and as a government minister.
I never hid my politics, not even in the last election.
No member of Nottingham East could be confused by my political stances and that I do not agree with the current leadership of the party.
To those who pushed Friday’s motion, all I would say is that as the country moves towards a Brexit that will affect our homes, businesses and public services, I don’t understand that desire to waste time and energy questioning my loyalty to the leader of the party.
But, in reality, the only message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether members of the party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat or political expediency will deter me from acting in what I consider to be in the best interests of all of you.
Chris Leslie is a Member of Parliament for Nottingham East.
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: undefeated Ayr takes the lead
It is possible that the last two attempts had altered the final result somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this pleasant match of Tenent's Premier League.
They now lead the table and are the only undefeated team of the ten.
Finally it was the superiority of his defense, as well as the fact of risking, led the team to victory. And coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
“So far they have tested us in our games and we are still undefeated, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie, of Melrose, said: "It must be acknowledged that Ayr took advantage of the opportunities better than us."
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute practice, transformed by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, loaned to the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to make the numbers speak and Jason Baggot caught a wrong pitch.
Climo increased the lead for Ayr with a penalty, before, just at halftime, he turned a solo shot, leaving the score 17–5 in Ayr's favour at halftime.
But Melrose started well in the second half and Patrick Anderson's practice, transformed by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
Then there was a prolonged stop for the serious injury suffered by Ruaridh Knott, who left the field on a paddle and, from the restart, Ayr advanced further through a rehearsal by Stafford McDowall, transformed by Climo.
Ayr's acting captain, Blair Macpherson, was given a yellow card and Melrose took advantage of having one more player with a Bruce Colvine try that was not consumed, at the end of a period of much pressure.
However, the home team returned and when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow card for scoring Climo when he did not have the ball, McPjherson scored a practice from the penalty line at the back of Ayr's maul.
Climo scored, as he had almost since the restart, after Kyle Rowe picked up the pitch in David Armstrong's area and sent him to third row Gregor Henry to get the home team's fifth practice.
The protagonist of Still Game begins a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran appears to be ready to enter the restaurant industry after it is discovered that he has been appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and co-stars with his longtime partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the definitive one, and it appears that Kierman is planning another life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment, though a Scottish Sun source hinted that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "thriving restaurant business".
'The sea is ours': inland Bolivia hopes the court the way to the Pacific
The sailors were guarding a naval headquarters covered with aircraft in La Paz.
Public buildings have a blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are flooded with the slogan: "The sea is ours by right.
It’s a duty to recover it.”
In sealess Bolivia, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody 19th-century resource conflict lives on, as does the longing to sail back across the Pacific Ocean.
Those hopes are perhaps at their highest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a decision from the international court of justice on Oct. 1 after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the necessary momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, expects a positive outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the CIX ruling on giant screens across the country in the hope that the Hague Court will rule in favor of Bolivia’s claim and that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile will be forced to negotiate Bolivia’s granting of a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president, who faces a contentious battle for re-election next year, also has a lot at stake in Monday’s ruling.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised in late August.
But some analysts consider it unlikely that the court would agree with Bolivia, and that little would change if that happened.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands has no power to award Chilean territory, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the judgment of the CIX comes only six months after the final arguments we heard indicates that the case “was not complicated,” says the Chilean expert in international law Paz Zárate.
And far from promoting the Bolivian cause, the last four years could have delayed it.
“The issue of access to the sea has long been blocked by the current Bolivian administration,” Zárate said.
Morales’ belligerent rhetoric undermined Chile’s remaining goodwill, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume talks at some point, but it will be very difficult to hold them after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court had made an unusually quick decision.
On Monday Bolivia will have "a fantastic opportunity to open a new stage of relations with Chile", and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, was using the issue for political purposes.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he said.
“The sentence is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen unless it can trust the U.S.
North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong says his nation will not proceed with nuclear disarmament if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made during a summit in Singapore among its leaders.
This comment comes at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of restarting stalled nuclear diplomacy for more than three decades after the summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is “a utopia” that continued U.S. sanctions and objections to a declaration ending the Korean War will succeed in doubling down on the North.
In Washington, they are reluctant to accept the declaration without Pyongyang taking the first step towards disarmament.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up an arsenal that the country is likely to see as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest line of giant hats that will soon be in stores.
If you want to increase your collection of hats or get completely covered from the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed on the runway a series of extravagant accessories for their spring-summer 2019 collection that embraced the public with the purest style of Paris Fashion Week.
The impossible hats filled Instagram this summer and these designers took to the runway their most amazing creations.
Valentino's main piece was an exaggerated beige hat adorned with a wide brim imitating feathers that flooded the heads of the models.
Among other large accessories were jeweled watermelons, a magician's hat, and even a pineapple, but they were not designed to protect the head from the cold.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of strange masks... just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had their lips sewn together and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One of the creations looked like a complete diving gear, with the goggles and the tube, and others a cone of melted ice.
And if you're a fan of the huge fashion, you're in luck.
Fashion connoisseurs predict that giant hats could make their way to the stores.
The disproportionate hats come right after the "Bomb", the straw hat with a 60-centimeter flap that carries everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the impossible hat that invades all social networks has brought to the catwalk another great creation: a straw beach bag almost as large as the model dressed in a swimsuit that wears it.
The orange raffia bag adorned with raffia flakes and finished with a white leather handle, was the highlight of the spring summer 2019 collection of Jacquemus' La Riviera at Paris Fashion Week.
Famed stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect big hats and beach bags to hit stores next summer, as the designer had such an impact that it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for the citizens of the world
Scotland’s private schools maintain a track record of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another crop of outstanding exam results, which is only reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community subjects.
With over 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the highest standard to pupils and their parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for higher education, for the career they choose and their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we are seeing that modern languages continue to be a popular and desired subject within schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, it hits him in the head.
But if you speak to him in his own language, it will reach his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year’s recent exams, we can see that languages are at the top of the table and with the highest pass rates in private schools.
68% of students who studied foreign languages achieved an outstanding mark.
The data, compiled from the 74 schools that make up SCIS, show that 72% of students obtained honors enrollment in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish, also achieved an outstanding.
This shows that Scottish private schools support languages and consider them key skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
At present, languages are being given the same consideration as subjects such as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in private school programs and of all kinds.
A survey by the UK’s Employment and Training Commission in 2014 found that a lack of language skills accounted for 17 per cent of the reasons why employers struggle to fill vacancies.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly essential to prepare young people for their future careers.
These skills are essential in a globalized world, as there are more job opportunities that require languages.
Regardless of the chosen career, if they learn a second language they will have a real advantage in the future with a life-long skill like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will place a bilingual person directly at the head of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75% did not speak any foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, in this case 15%.
That’s why it’s so important to invest in a language for today’s children.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developing economies, provides children with more opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, the languages of instruction differ according to the school.
Some schools focus on the more classical modern languages, while others opt for languages considered more important to the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of what the interests of your children are, private schools always have several languages to choose from and specialist teachers in this field.
Scottish private schools specialise in providing a learning environment that equips children and staff with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future holds.
We cannot deny that at this moment, in a global business environment, that languages remain of vital importance for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communicative skills".
Private schools will continue to offer this diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
It has to be done.
John Edwards is the Director of the Scottish Council for Private Schools.
LeBron makes Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James play for the first time with the Los Angeles Lakers.
The team's coach, Like Walton, announced that James will play the opening game of the preseason against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It remains to be seen how many minutes he will play.
"It's going to be more than 1 and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably play a few minutes.
After training earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason.
At this point in my career I don’t need pre-season games to be ready,” he said.
Trump's Election Deeds Arrive in Virginia on YouTube
President Donald Trump begins a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It will be the first of Trump’s five scheduled rallies next week, including stops in cities like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote on hold for his nominee to fill the Supreme Court vacancy, Trump aims to garner support for the upcoming midterm elections, given that Republicans risk losing control of Congress when it votes in November.
What time is Trump’s rally in West Virginia and how can you see it on the internet?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for Saturday, Sept. 29, 2018, at 7 p.m.
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address the trial of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh this week, who has become tense over allegations of sexual misconduct and is holding the Senate confirmation vote for a week while the FBI investigates.
But the main goal of this series of rallies is to help Republicans face the November elections with new momentum.
So these five rallies that Trump will hold next week aim to “energize volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majorities they have in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Congress control is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible ahead of the campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Tonight’s rally, to be held at Wesbanco Stadium, could bring together supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and get media coverage of Pittsburgh,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state in which he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, last in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to his support in the polls,” Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows endurance to fight and keep hope alive until Sunday’s individual matches
After three individual sessions, Saturday afternoon’s foursome could have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The oscillating impulse pendulum is a totally invented sports concept but in which athletes really believe, and especially in competitions like this.
So where would you say the momentum is now?
“They had a six-point lead and now it’s four, so I guess we take that as a little bit of momentum,” Jordan Spieth said as he left at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has four advantage points with twelve more at stake.
Americans, Spieth said, feel they have a bit of a headwind and a lot to cheer for, among other things the technique of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each has three points out of four.
Spieth has been lethal from tee to green and is leading by example.
Those guttural screams became louder as his round progressed, making a crucial putt to tie the fourth game when he and Thomas were two points down after two.
When he got the putt that made them win Game 15, he put out a similar scream, the kind of scream that says he thinks the American team is not out yet.
“You just have to focus and worry about your game,” Spieth said.
That’s all that’s left for these players.
18 holes to leave a footprint.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European couple have four out of four and can't go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only pair who did not bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided them on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and not the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That run, and the way it seems to flow its energy to and from the crowd, confirms them as the rivals to beat on Sunday, and there could be no more popular players to get a win when the sun sets on Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, talking about European glory is still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly dispatched Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourballs, when he paired up with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first course finished with the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole from which they were never close to leaving.
But on Sunday there will be no one to help get out of the hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to see up close by the interactions between couples, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give, and how you can change a strategy in an instant.
Europe have played better as a team so far and have a significant advantage on the last day, but this foursome session also proved that Team USA has the stamina to fight, something that some, especially Stateside, doubted.
Europe leads 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will enjoy a good advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after coming out of the fourballs and foursomes with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two wins over a Tiger Woods struggling to move up four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, looking to retain the trophy they lost two years ago at Hazeltine, dominated an American team that failed in the morning fourballs, putting the series 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, winning four games, but could not cut the lead.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from Sunday's 12 individual games to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points from the opening four games in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they fit in perfectly to defeat a deflated Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with a more categorical 5&4.
Woods, who played two matches on Saturday without penalty or glory, showed occasional bursts of brilliance, but now lost 19 of 29 matches in the fourballs and foursomes and five in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested in the morning fourballs, rejoined his partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes picking up a loss to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, world number one and number three.
Europe could not always win on a pleasant breeze day in southwest Paris.
Three-time champion Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans by scoring two points on Saturday.
They scored a 2&1 win over Spain's John Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and again beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursomes after losing the first two holes.
There have only been two times in Ryder Cup history in which a team has gone back four points in the individual, although as the current holder of the trophy, Furyk's team only needs to draw to retain it.
However, after being the second best in two days, a counterattack on Sunday seems to be out of reach.
North Korea says no to unilateral disarmament if there is no confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions increased its distrust of the United States and that the country would not surrender its nuclear weapons under the circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "important steps to show its goodwill" last year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear test fields and committing to the proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not see the corresponding response from the US," he added.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and in such circumstances, there will be no unilateral disarmament on our part first.”
While Ri echoed well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to "gradual" denuclearisation under which North Korea would be rewarded as it took action, his statement seemed important, as he did not reject unilateral denuclearisation as had happened with Pyongyang in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between an active US president and a North Korean leader held in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to "denuclearize" the Korean Peninsula "as long as Trump guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea has long sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has declared that Pyongyang must first lay down its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted easing tough international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'denuclearization first' and increases the pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal of coercive force, and even opposes the 'declaration of the end of war'," Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can make us kneel is an impossible dream for those who do not know us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions exacerbate our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader mentioned at the United Nations earlier this week.
However, he spoke of three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added, "If the other side of this denuclearization issue was South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have come to a standstill."
Still, the tone of Ri’s speech was radically different from last year’s, when he told the United Nations General Assembly it was inevitable to strike the United States with North Korean missiles after “evil President” Trump called Kim a “rocket man on a suicide mission.”
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps toward disarmament, but said much work remains to be done and that sanctions must be maintained until North Korea is denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no deadline for that, and that "it doesn't matter if it takes two years, three or five months."
China and Russia are discussing whether the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that “compliance with Security Council sanctions must continue firmly and without exception until we observe full, final and verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to cut funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then commented that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, just hours before North Korea denounced him for making "mafia demands".
In a meeting with Moon earlier this month, North Korea vowed to dismantle a missile site, as well as a nuclear complex, if the United States took the “corresponding measures.”
He said Kim had told him that the “corresponding measures” he was requesting were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and progress toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest
This year, a new course from Harvard University is getting all its students to sleep longer in order to combat the growth of the sexist culture of studying all night long stimulated by caffeine.
One academic found that students at the world’s number one university are often unaware of the basics about taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, conceived the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the U.S.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the impact that lack of sleep had on learning.
“At the end of the course, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why are you only telling me this now, in my senior year?’
He said no one had told him about the importance of sleeping, which surprised me," she told The Telegraph.
The course, which was launched this year for the first time, explains to students the basics about how acquiring good sleep habits helps with academic and athletic performance, as well as improves overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students had a significant lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a bedroom, where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, trainers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how sleep deficit affects athletic performance, as well as the importance of having a bedtime routine.
In another section, participants are told how prolonged lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that it will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know this information, just as we have a right to know what the health effects are if we choose to smoke tobacco,” Professor Czeisler added.
The culture of pride in staying up all night still exists, he says, and he adds that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students that involved lack of sleep was a growing problem.
Ensuring enough sleep and good quality sleep should be a student's "secret weapon" for combating stress, fatigue and anxiety, he says. Even avoiding getting fat, since lack of sleep causes the brain to go into starvation mode, which makes it constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after attending one of his classes last year during his freshman year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to push a campus-wide course.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all graduate students to complete a similar program of study before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm for bedtime, as well as for when they wake up. Likewise, it is recommended that they be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can unbalance the circadian rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga's goal knocks out Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another sad episode when Dolly Menga's attack relegated Steven Gerrard's disjointed team to a 1–0 loss at Livingston.
The Ibrox team had intended to record their first home win since the 4–1 win at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team occasioned Gerrard's second loss in 18 games as coach, which left his team eight points behind the Hearts, leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership, the Scottish League.
Menga attacked seven minutes before the break and a Rangers lineup with little inspiration never felt like a draw.
While the Rangers descended to sixth place, Livingston climbed to third place and is only behind Hibernian by a goal difference.
And it could have been much worse for the Rangers after lineman Judge Calum Spence had to deal with a head injury following the alleged throwing of an object.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that swept Ayr in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup, the Scottish League Cup.
On the other hand, Holt was with the same 11th of Livingston who scored a point for the Hearts last week and would have been delighted with the way their organized ensemble stifled their opponents at all times.
It is possible that the Rangers dominated possession, but Livingston did much more when they had the ball.
They could have scored in just two minutes when Menga's first-half short pass sent Scott Pittman into Allan McGregor's net, but the midfielder squandered this big opportunity.
A powerful free kick from Keaghan Jacobs came to Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgow, only managed to nail him to the second stick.
The Rangers took control, but it seems they had more hope than conviction about their play in the offensive area.
Without a doubt, Alfredo Morelos felt he should have taken the penalty in the 15th minute when he and Steven Lawless collided, but the referee, Steven Thomson, ignored the Colombian's claims.
The Rangers only made two shots at the door in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly barely had problems with Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's attack.
While Livingston’s 34th-minute opening could have gone against the logic of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for their hard work.
The Rangers again failed to cope with Jacobs' strong formation.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher snapped the ball for Scott Robinson, who kept cold blooded to pick Menga for a single shot.
Gerrard acted on the break by switching Coulibaly to Ryan Kent, a change that almost had an immediate effect when the left-hander made a pass to Morelos, but the towering Kelly ran from his line to block him.
But Livingston continued to devour visitors by playing exactly the kind of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett picking up one long ball after another.
Holt's team could have extended the lead in the closing moments, but McGregor stood up perfectly to reject Jacobs before Lithgow headed from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton claimed another penalty when entangled with Jacobs, but Thomson turned a blind eye again.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and TALKING...was the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger counter.
A cornerstone of science since then, the Geiger counter has also become a staple of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring those seemingly unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What in the world is that?”
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
By putting on these headphones, you can hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity of the minerals."
Evans: "Say, it's definitely popping now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name survives.
New cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to ‘see’ defective cells
New cancer vaccine may teach immune system to ‘see’ defective cells and kill them
Vaccine Teaches Immune System to Recognize Defective Cells as Part of Treatment
The method involves removing immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory.
They can "see" a protein common to several types of cancer and re-inject it
A trial vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize defective cells, has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from a patient, which are altered in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to several types of cancer called HER2, and then reject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "drives the growth of several types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, Berzofsky said.
A similar approach to removing immune cells from patients and "teaching" them to target cancer cells worked in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarked on a pro-Trump speech wearing a MAGA (Make America Great Again) hat after his appearance on Saturday Night Live (SNL).
The result was not good
During a Saturday Night Live show, they tapped Kanye West in the studio after a confusing presentation in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run as a candidate in 2020.
After performing the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, on which he wore a Make America Great Again cap, he criticized the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“I often talk to a white man and say, ‘How can you like Trump if he’s a racist?’
“If I was worried about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began the show with a satire starring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee about Christine Blasey Ford's sexual assault lawsuits.
Although it was not broadcast, Chris Rock uploaded the images of West's criticism to social networks.
It is unclear whether Rock was trying to make fun of West with this post.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had had a bad time backstage due to his cap.
“They went behind the scenes with me.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat on."
They intimidated me!
And then they said I was going down," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see how I'm falling apart?", saying he would "wear my Superman cap, because it means you can't tell me what to do."
Try it with love.”
His comments roused the audience at least twice and the SNL cast members appeared to be embarrassed, he told Variety, with the following testimony that a person who was there gave to the publication: "The whole studio was absolutely silent."
They had named West as the last replacement for Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West perplexed many people with a rendition of the song I Love It, dressed as a Perrier water bottle.
West won the support of TPUSA leader Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest minds: THANK YOU FOR FRONTING THE MAFIA"
However, talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply "being who he is and that's completely wonderful".
“However, I have chosen NOT to reward anyone (by buying their music or clothing or supporting their ‘art’) who I think is embracing and spreading an ideology that is harmful to my community.
It's free.
Just like us,” he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying it was now "being officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name; he follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapper Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Lion and, of course, the last music legend, Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then the artist formerly known as Prince.

The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The Public Prosecutor’s Office will review the charges.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his sword-wielding role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor has attacked the stereotype of a sexist hero, saying such on-screen roles translate into what it seems like young men often have to be tough to get respect for them.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said "something has failed" and wondered how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the age of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, 31, admitted that she feels "strong enough" to address the issue.
"Personally, I feel pretty strong right now. Where did we go wrong with masculinity?" he said.
“What do we teach men when they grow up, in terms of the problem we see now?”
Kit believes that television can be partially responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity thanks to its very masculine characters.
He continued, "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and in the streets; what makes young people feel that they have to be that particular part of being a man?
I think that’s one of the big questions of our time; how do we change that?
“Something went wrong with the kids.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not make any Game of Thrones prequels or sequels when the series comes to an end next summer, stating that "no more horses and battlefields".
Starting in November, Kit will star in a remake of Sam Shepard’s True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that he considers that his meeting with his wife, Rose, was the best of Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife on this show, so it kind of provided for my future family and my life going forward,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS.
It affects more than 820,000 people in the country, health authorities said.
40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases have been sexually transmitted, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people contracting HIV in this way had been reduced to virtually zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, in year-on-year terms, the number of people living with HIV or AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was discriminated against in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people has spread.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that between 70 and 90 percent of men who have sex with men will end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of the disease come from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV mediation as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies a staffer leaked GOP Senators’ data, “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
On Saturday, U.S. Representative Maxine Waters denounced allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information about three U.S. Republican Party senators on lawmakers’ Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the statements were being made by websites and “ultra-right” commentators.
“Lies, lies and more infamous lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The release reportedly included the private addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill, the seat of the U.S. government, during a Senate panel hearing about allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came shortly after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the origin of the postings was associated with the Waters department and disclosed the information of a Waters staff member, Capitol Hill reported.
“This baseless accusation is totally false and a complete lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these false and fraudulent allegations, was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unfounded accusation is totally false and a complete lie.”
Waters' statement immediately drew criticism online, including from former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial was made in anger," Fleischer wrote.
“He has no temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn’t do, they shouldn’t be angry.
It should not be challenging.
You must not question the accuser's motives.
You have to be calm and calm.”
It appeared Fleischer was comparing Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, whom critics accused of looking too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who ran to oust Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Very strong if it's true," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his department has alerted “the law enforcement and appropriate authorities of these fraudulent allegations.
“We will make sure that we find the culprits, as well as hold them legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to each and every member of my team.”
Johnny English Strikes Again, Rowan Atkinson's parody of a powerless spy
It is already traditional to look for the significance of Brexit in new films from a British point of view and it seems that this can be applied to the return of the franchise of this parody and action comedy of Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn ("Johnny English Returns").
Will the ironic satire on the matter of how patently stupid we are become in the nation’s new export opportunity?
Either way, Johnny English's incompetent jumpy-eyed, rubber-faced character has renewed his license to ruin things for the second time. His name is already a clear indication that this is a general comedic creation designed for non-English-speaking cinephile territories.
Of course, it is the silly secret agent who, despite his quirky pretensions to flattering glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a bit of Mr Bean and a bit of that kind who contributed a single note to the theme of Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
It is also originally based on the cosmopolitan and mysterious international agent Atkinson once played in Barclaycard's now-forgotten television commercials, in which he sowed chaos in his wake.
There are a couple of good moments in Johnny English’s last outing.
I love it when Johnny English approaches a helicopter while wearing a medieval suit of armor and the rotor footsteps make a brief bang against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is obvious, but it seems that humor has little force and is strangely superfluous, especially when such "serious" films as 007 and Mission Impossible already use comedy convincingly as one of its ingredients.
It seems as if the humor is directed at children, rather than adults, and, in my opinion, Johnny English's extravagant misadventures are not as witty or concentrated as Atkinson's silent-movie jokes about playing Bean's character.
Now the permanently topical argument is that Britain has serious problems.
A cyber-hacker infiltrates Britain’s super-secret web spy network and reveals the identities of all the British agents in the area, much to the distress of the agent who is on duty, an unfortunate small role for Kevin Eldon.
It’s the height of a pompous and conflicted prime minister, already suffering a total crisis of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does her best with this character who almost looks like Theresa May, but not much can be done with the script.
His intelligence advisers inform him that as all active spies have been compromised, he will have to pull someone out of retirement.
And that refers to the incompetent Johnny English himself, who now works as a teacher in some snob institution, but gives unofficial lessons on how to become an undercover agent; in this part there are some jokes, when English offers the spy academy to a rock school.
They take English back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and meet with his long-suffering partner Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man with a submarine captain, an enthusiastic role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little lost.
So the Batman and Robin of His Majesty's Secret Service make a comeback, encountering Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously succumbing to the charm of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous forgery: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a flamboyant French restaurant; they create a riot that illegally puts them aboard Volta's luxury yacht; and English provokes total anarchy by trying to wear virtual reality helmets to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
Evidently, all the arrests come from that last sequence, but in the kind and outrageous way that it is, it seems to be taken from a children's television show.
The result is fairly regular.
And, as with Johnny English’s other films, I couldn’t help but think: can’t the British film industry offer Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talent?
Labour denies it is drawing up a plan for Britons to work four days a week but charge for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is considering a radical plan that will make Britons work four days a week, but pay for five days a week.
Allegedly, the party wants employers to pass on the savings achieved through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by offering them an additional day off.
In this way, the employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but would continue to receive the same salary.
The sources say the idea would "fit" the party's economic agenda and its plans to tilt the country in favor of workers.
The Congress of Trade Unions supported the four-day-a-week shifts as a measure for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is an ambition that fits the party’s approach to balancing the economy in favor of the worker, as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its campaign for the 2017 general election.
However, the Labour Party does not currently support ambition in its entirety.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day working week does not enter into the party's policy and is not being considered by the party."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week’s Labour Party conference to bolster his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of “anonymous directors” and “speculators” in public service companies.
The shadow chancellor's plans also involve the possibility that the current shareholders of the water companies will not recover all their investment, as a Labour government could make "deductions" because of perceived irregularities.
It also confirmed plans to place workers on company boards and create inclusive ownership funds to hand over 10% of private sector company shares to employees, who pocket annual dividends worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's Kavanaugh investigation could change their minds
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed at least a week the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court. The question arises as to whether the department's findings could influence Republican senators to withdraw their support.
On Sunday, in the broadcast of an interview, "60 Minutes" reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring to light something that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said I'd go to the hearing. I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the indictment came out and asked him if he had done it.
He was determined, determined, determined.”
However, Graham’s vote seems to be immovable.
“My opinion about Brett Kavanaugh is decided and I would make an explosive accusation,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened; but I know this: Brett flatly denied it,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And the people you mentioned couldn’t verify it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I don’t see anything new.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an impressive lineup of performing stars and an equally impressive mission, to end global poverty.
In its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see thousands of people flock to the Great Lawn area of Central Park, not only to enjoy performances like those of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the event’s real goal of ending poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), the audience had to complete a series of tasks or “actions,” such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or any other meaningful way to help raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
But what is the degree of success achieved by the Global Citizen 12 years after achieving its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way of persuading people to ask for action, or is it just another case of so-called “clictivism,” people who think it makes a difference to sign an online petition or send a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million “actions” from its followers, driving a different set of goals.
These actions have helped spur world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion set to influence the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements derived from its shares, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that so far the guaranteed funds have had a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK society of investors and implementers that has pledged to “help children develop to their full potential”, with a promise to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizen.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national authorities and Global Citizen supporters like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a footnote to history,” The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in April 2018 in London.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to improve the nutrition of mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funding for The Power of Nutrition project that will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their website, “What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?”,
Global Citizen responded, “It will be a long and difficult road, and sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, just as it happened with the great anti-apartheid and civil rights movements that preceded us, we will achieve it, because together, we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are among the artists who will perform at this year’s event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the navy to carry out a “blockade” to hinder Russia’s energy exports, the U.S. Secretary of the Interior has announced.
“If necessary,” Washington can turn to the navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s engagement in Syria, especially where it operates at the behest of the legitimate government, is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
“I think the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to negotiate with energy the same way they did in Eastern Europe,” he said.
And, according to the official, they have the means and the means to deal with it.
“The United States has the ability, along with the navy, to ensure that the sea lanes are open and, if necessary, to block them to ensure that their power does not go to market,” he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that calls itself the “voice of the energy consumer” in the US.
He compared Washington’s strategies for dealing with Russia and Iran, bearing in mind that, in practice, it is the same.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia is, more or less, to take advantage of and replace fuels," he said, while referring to Russia saying it "only has one tactic" with a hydrocarbon-dependent economy.
The statements were made while the Trump administration was on a mission to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, in order to replace that of Russia, the most economical option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including the president himself, tried to persuade Germany to pull out of the “inadequate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump said made Berlin a “captive” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which was established to double the existing pipeline’s capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a mere economic project.
The Kremlin has argued that Washington’s fervent opposition to the project is only argued on economic grounds and that it is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we share the idea that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in September in Moscow.
The U.S. position got the reaction of Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to move away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply,” BDI President Dieter Kempf said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Will Carefully Examine Her 2020 Presidential Candidacy, Says Massachusetts Senator
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would carefully consider her candidacy for president after the midterm elections.
During a public meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidacy.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and repair the fractured government and that includes a woman in power,” she said.
“After November 6, I will carefully examine my candidacy for president.”
Warren opined on President Donald Trump during the public assembly, stating that he was “taking this country in the wrong direction.
“I’m very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren was outspoken in her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren said in a tweet, "Of course an FBI investigation is needed before the vote."
However, in a poll published on Thursday, it was shown that most of Warren’s own voters do not believe he will run in 2020.
Fifty percent of Massachusetts' "probable" voters said the senator would not run, according to a poll by the University of Suffolk's Center for Political Research and the Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the proposal.
The poll showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 percent supporting a possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other prominent Democrats in relation to a possible 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide before January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin quotes post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) from Track Palin at Donald Trump's rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident.
“With what my own son is going through, with what’s happening again, I can see myself reflected in other families who are feeling the consequences of PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers are coming back with,” he told the audience at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin said his arrest was a taboo subject and that his son and other war veterans, "come back different, hardened, wondering if there is any respect for what fellow militiamen and airmen, as well as other members of the military, have offered the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, interfering with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and the District of Columbia challenge the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a judicial remedy in connection with a new U.S. policy denying asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence or criminal organizations.
On Friday, representatives from 18 states and the district filed a court-friendly report in Washington to support an asylum seeker who defies policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against the federal policy was not disclosed.
She said her partner "and her children members of a violent criminal organization" abused her, but that U.S. officials rejected her asylum request on July 20.
Detected in Texas.
Lawyers from the states that support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce large numbers of asylum seekers for the U.S., as nations facing widespread problems with criminal organizations and related domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation."
“Federal law requires that all asylum applications be adjudicated according to the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such a prohibition violates that principle,” the court’s report said.
Taxpayers continued to debate in the report that the policy that rejects the entry of immigrants harms the U.S. economy, explaining that they are likely to become entrepreneurs and that they “provide labor.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and violence from criminal organizations.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in his June 11 announcement of the policy.
Asylum has never been intended to alleviate all the problems (including all the serious problems) that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the death toll doubles in a race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
“Circumstances are very tense,” says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, consoling her feverish baby in the evacuation center of the downed city of Palu.
“Every minute an ambulance arrives with bodies.
And clean water is scarce.”
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, collecting their drowned belongings, trying to save whatever they found.
Hundreds of people are injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake, are overflowing.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who fractured his back and shoulder, were resting outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to continued strong aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he explained how he felt the violent earthquake shake the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save us.
The ruins of the wall crushed me, I think," Haris told The Associated Press, adding that his family was at a wedding in the city.
“I heard my wife asking for help and then just silence.
I don’t know what happened to her or my daughter.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. ambassador accuses China of abuse with 'propaganda ads'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper proclaiming the benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
Donald Trump, the U.S. president, referenced the China Daily pay supplement in the Des Moines Register, Iowa’s best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of meddling in the Nov. 6 U.S. congressional election, which China denies.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to meddle in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials have branded on Reuters as a new phase in Washington’s growing campaign to coerce China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to run ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently caught up in a growing trade war that testifies to the leveling of tariffs on their respective imports.
According to experts from China and the US, China’s countervailing tariffs at the start of the trade war were designed to hurt exporters from states like Iowa, which backs Trump’s Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has harmed American workers, farmers and businessmen.
In an opinion piece written by Branstad and published in Sunday’s edition of the Moines Register, it was stated that China “is intensifying that campaign of harassment by running propaganda ads in the free American press.”
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of America’s cherished tradition of freedom of speech and press by publishing a paid ad in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, at the newspaper stand at the end of this street in Beijing, there are few dissenting voices and no real reflection of the disparate views that the Chinese may have on China's worrying economic trajectory, given that the media is under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he added.
He also claims that "one of China's most important newspapers declined to publish" his article, although he did not confirm which newspaper it was.
Kavanaugh loses the female Republican vote just days before the midterm elections.
While many leading Republicans support and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, despite varying accusations of sexual assault, analysts warn of a backlash, especially among female voters, in the upcoming midterm elections.
Reactions to these charges were numerous and most Republicans were positioned to move forward with the vote.
"These things can't be undone," Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, said in a paper published Sunday in The Hill.
Reeher also stated that he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) last minute for an FBI investigation would be enough to calm the spirits of angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday, just as they will not forget it in the near future or in November,” Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, told the Washington, D.C. daily on Friday.
On Friday morning, opponents, to the grip of "Approach November!", rallied in the Senate corridor, while Republicans, with control of the Judiciary Committee, decided to go ahead with the appointment of Kavanaugh, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
“The motivation and enthusiasm of the Democrats will exceed any expectation,” Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst, told the news site.
“It’s already high.
But it will be even more so, especially among the indecisive women voters in the suburbs or those who are between 18 and 29 years old, who although they do not like the President, do not usually go to the polls.
Before Ford’s public testimony detailed his sexual assault allegations against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested it was possible to suffer a backlash if Republicans went ahead with confirmation.
“This has become a disaster for the Republican Party,” Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
"This goes beyond the committee vote, the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will sit on the bench or not. The problem is how the Republicans handled this and how they handled it," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats on the news channel.
However, it seems that Americans are divided between whether to believe Ford's testimony or Kavanaugh's, although they are more inclined to support the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41% of people surveyed fully or probably believe Ford’s testimony, compared to 35% who support Kavanaugh’s testimony.
In addition, 38% believe that Kavanaugh is most likely to lie during his testimony, compared to 30% who think the same of Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations filed by Ford, as well as those of at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath that Kavanaugh assaulted her in a drunken state when she was 17.
Instead, Ramirez alleges that the Supreme Court nominee showed her the genitals at a college party while she was studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The creator of the World Wide Web wants to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of this technology legend, is a company based on Solid, Berners-Lee's open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people can access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's intention is to "dominate the world".
"We have to do it," he said of the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own “online personal data store” or POD.
You can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify were all available in a single browser at the same time.
All this makes this personal data store unique is that the user has complete control over who can access what information.
The company calls this “personal empowerment through data.”
Inrupt’s vision, according to its president John Bruce, is for the company to provide appropriate resources, processes, and skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, an IBM-owned security company, some developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, developers around the world could create their own decentralised applications with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that neither he nor his team spoke to "Facebook or Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change that would change their business models overnight.
"We don't need your permission."
In an article published Saturday in Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s “mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of a new Solid-based web.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing the World Wide Web Consortium community at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has risen as an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium community, as well as the Web Foundation and Open Data Institute organizations.
“I’m very optimistic about this new era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Tribute to Bernard Vann, a clergyman awarded the Victoria Cross in the First World War
The only clergyman in the Church of England to be awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I received a posthumous tribute in his hometown 100 years later.
The Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded on 29 September 1918, in the attack of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later without knowing that he had been awarded the highest British military decoration.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren were tasked with discovering a memorial in his honour at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
Michael Vann, one of his grandchildren, highlighted the symbolism of discovering this monument just 100 years after his grandfather’s feat that earned him the title.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a dense fog and under the yoke of intense machine-gun fire".
He then rushed to the line of fire and, with "great courage", directed the line forward before rushing in with a cannon and without any help from anyone, and shooting down three people from the enemy detachment.
Lt. Col. Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I could never live with, but a lesson nonetheless".
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also placed a wreath after the parade, which headlined the Brentwood Imperial youth band.
Michael Vann said he was "very honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the value of this genuine hero is demonstrated by the support of so many people."
Peppa Pig Cuts the Roll for MMA Fans at the Best Time
Imagine you’re up all night enjoying the full show of Bellator 206, and when you get to the best part something stops you.
The San Jose cartel included 13 fights, six of them major, and was being broadcast live in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
But at 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were to meet face to face, viewers in the UK were baffled when they saw Peppa Pig appear.
Some were not impressed after having spent so many waking hours waiting to see the fight.
One fan described the change to these children's drawings on Twitter as "a very tasteless joke".
“State regulations dictate that such content was not appropriate for 6 a.m., and so had to be switched to children’s programming,” Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, explained when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa Pig, that's it."
Scott Coker, Bellator’s president, said they will consider UK viewers in future programming.
“I think we can work it out when we think about repetition,” Coker said.
“But if it’s 6 a.m. there, we can’t solve it until Sunday, which will be Monday for them.
But we are working to find a solution.
When the change happened I started to receive a lot of messages and not all of them were pleasant.
We were trying to fix it because we thought it was a technical error.
No, it was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen again.
We will limit ourselves to five fights, instead of six. We wanted to give our best to our fans, but we spent and
It hurts a lot of anger.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley claims that he grew up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality, but this made him find the motivation to succeed.
This 24-year-old athlete claims he didn’t realize that not everyone was like him until he got to high school.
Guest of the first broadcast of the program Desert Island Discs of Radio 4 led by Lauren Laverne, he explained that he began to talk about the rights of homosexuals to give hope to others.
He also shared that being a father helped him to relativize the importance of winning the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the regular host of this show, is on sick leave.
As a guest on the first Laverne-led show, Daley shared that he felt "inferior" to the rest of the people because "it wasn't socially acceptable that you liked boys and girls."
“To this day, that feeling of inferiority and being different is what drove me and gave me the strength to succeed.”
I wanted to show that I was "someone" so that people wouldn't be disappointed to discover their sexuality.
With two Olympic bronze medals, he became a prominent LGBT activist and used his appearance at the Commonwealth Games of Australia to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He decided to speak up because he felt lucky to be able to live openly and without fear of repercussions, and he wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, "was quite a surprise".
Daley married this Oscar winner last year and claims that the 20 years difference between them has never been a problem.
"When you live so long in such a short time" (at just 14 years old he first participated in an Olympic Games and his father died of cancer three years later), it is difficult to find someone your age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple had their first child in June, Robert Ray Black-Daley, and this birth caused Daley to completely change her perspective.
“If you asked me last year, my biggest motivation would be to win a gold medal,” he says.
“But now I know that there are much more important things than an Olympic gold medal.
For me, my medal is Robbie.”
His son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley's father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked his son was for tickets to London 2012, he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell her I wouldn’t be here to occupy that front row,” Daley shared.
“I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and it was at that precise moment, at the moment of his death, that I realized that he really wasn’t invincible.”
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“At that moment I knew that this was the dream of my life: to jump in front of a crowd in my country participating in the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling,” he said.
The choice of the song Proud by Heather Small is also not in vain, as it is the melody that accompanied him during his preparation for the Olympics and still makes his hair stand on end.

Mickelson in poor form ended up on the bench of the Ryder Cup this Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will break a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he must improve his technique so that it does not become an unfortunate event.
Mickelson, who is participating in the biennial event for the 12th time, stayed on the bench at the decision of Captain Jim Furyk and was unable to participate in either the fourball or Saturday's foursomes.
Instead of being the center of action, as so many times for the United States, the five-time champion spent the day cheering and working to improve his moves.
Although he was never the most accurate of the players, not even at the height of his career, at 48 years old he does not fit into the tight Le Golf National course, where tall grass usually punishes the wrong shots.
And if that wasn't enough, Mickelson faces the precise British Open winner Francesco Molinari in Sunday's ninth game, who joined Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans, four points down at the start of the 12 individual games, start on a good footing, Mickelson’s performance could be entirely crucial.
Furyk trusted his man, though he couldn't say much more.
“He perfectly understood the role I was playing today, patted me on the shoulder, put his arm around me and told me I’d be ready tomorrow,” Furyk shared.
“He had complete confidence in himself.
He has a prominent place in the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to the teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn’t think I’d play two games.
I thought I would play more, but in the end that’s how things are and that’s how we thought they should be.
Like everyone else, he wants to be out there.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo’s record for most Ryder Cup games played.
It could mark the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, a career that has never reached the level of his individual honours.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyk states that his presence also provides intangibles to the team.
“He’s a fun, sarcastic, resourceful person who likes to mess with people, he’s a good guy to have on the team,” he explained.
“I like to see how good the younger players have been with him this week.
He’s a lot more of a good player.”
The captain of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, fears for the disappearance of the advantage
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a considerable lead on the last Ryder Cup singles day can easily turn into an awkward journey.
The Great Dane debuted in 1997 in a match at Valderrama, where a team captained by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but they ended up reaching the finish line with a minimal lead winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You still think we had a big advantage in Valderrama; just like in Brookline, where we lost, but in Valderrama we won by a little," reflects Bjorn, in the photo, after seeing the 2018 promotion win 5-3 on Friday and, yesterday, 10-6 at Le Golf National.
History shows that this is not over yet.
Tomorrow we all have to go.
You have to go out and do the right thing.
This does not stop until the points are on the scoreboard.
Our goal is to win that trophy, and we have to focus on that.
I’m focused on our 12 players who are on our side, but I’m also very aware of what’s on the other side: the best players in the world.”
Delighted with his players' performance on a hard golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never sing victory before time.
Tomorrow we meet the other beast.
Tomorrow is the day of the individual performances, and there we also have to prove our worth.
It’s great to be with a partner around when things are going well, but when you’re facing things individually, then put your golfing skills to the maximum.
That’s the message you need to send to the players, to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind, and he too must get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will look for his players to have a better individual performance than his teammates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself was on both ends of those laps of the last day, being part of the winning team at Brookline, but finishing as a loser after the European miracle at Medinah.
"I remember every damn word," he replied when asked if he remembered how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had gathered the players for the final day.
“We have 12 important games, but you would like to have a fast start like Brookline or Medinah.
When you see the momentum going in one direction, there’s a lot of pressure in those intermediate games.
We prepared our lineup with this in mind and put the players as we saw fit, we want to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas is tasked with trying to lead the fight and face Rory McIlroy in the first match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans, in the top half of the standings.
“I decided on this order because I think it covers all the way,” Bjorn explained of his selection for the individual.
Germany's new warship postponed once again
The German Navy’s newest frigate should have been delivered in 2014 to replace aging Cold War-era warships, but it won’t arrive until at least next year due to faulty systems and rising cost, local media reported.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the leading ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, was postponed until the first half of 2019, a military spokesman told the newspaper Die Zeit.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014, but post-delivery problems affected the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ships, which the Navy commissioned in 2007, will replace the former Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that they will have a powerful cannon, with different anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as with concealment technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, it should be possible to deploy the younger frigates up to two years outside the ports of origin.
However, as Die Zeit points out, these continuous delays mean that warships with the latest technology, and which will allow Germany to project its power abroad, will be outdated when they enter service.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the vessel and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned a ship to a builder after delivery.
Little was known about the motives behind this return, but the German media reported "crucial flaws in the software and hardware" that made it impossible to use the warship in a combat mission.
The software flaws were particularly significant, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of 120 sailors; that is, half of the personnel needed on the former Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, the ship was found to have a dramatic excess weight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add improvements in the future.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is thought to weigh twice as much as the similar-class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the total price of the project, which includes crew training, is also becoming an issue.
It is claimed that it has already reached the astonishing amount of 3.1 billion euros, compared to the initial 2.2 billion.
The problems of the newer frigates take on special importance in light of recent warnings that Germany’s naval power is waning.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defense committee of the German parliament, acknowledged that the Navy is running out of ships suitable for deployment.
The officer states that this problem is growing, as older ships have been retired, but not replaced by others.
He also regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates could join the Navy.
National Trust Spies on the Secret Life of Bats
New research being carried out on a Scottish Highlands estate aims to reveal how bats use the landscape to forage for food.
The results are expected to shed light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
This study led by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will follow the bats Pipistrellus pygmaeus and Pipistrellus pipistrellus, as well as the bats Myotis daubentonii and Plecotus auritus in the gardens of Inverewe at Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment will be placed at key locations around the property to track bat activities during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys with hand-held detectors.
A sound analysis performed by experts from all the recordings will determine the frequency of the calls of the bats and what each species is doing.
Next, a habitat map will be developed to create a detailed landscape-scale image of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Conservation Advisor, hopes the results will show which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as grassland creation and how best to maintain forests for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined considerably over the last century.
These animals are threatened by construction and development works affecting nests and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting also pose a risk, as do fly glue traps, some chemical treatments of building materials, and domestic cat attacks.
The bats are not blind.
But because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when hunting.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to locate insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who carry out periodic surveys, inspections of children and, sometimes, even rescues.
The organisation even has Scotland's only and first reserve of bats at the Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
David Thompson, manager of Estate, says this is the ideal territory for them.
"At Threate we have a great area for bats," he says.
"We have old buildings, historic trees and a great habitat.
But there’s a lot we still don’t know about bats, so the work we’ve done here and on other properties will help us better understand what they need to thrive.”
It highlights the importance of controlling the presence of bats before carrying out maintenance tasks on the properties, since it is possible that the involuntary destruction of a single maternity nest can kill up to 400 females and offspring, which could exterminate an entire local population.
Bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them, as well as destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, encourages people to help:
"There's still a lot to learn about bats, and for many of the species, we don't know how their populations are doing."
Ronaldo dismisses rape lawsuits and his lawyers prepare to sue German publication
Cristiano Ronaldo describes the rape allegations against him as false, claiming that all people want to do is make themselves known using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German magazine Der Spiegel for publishing these allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus forward was accused of raping Kathryn Mayorga, an American woman, at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is alleged that the footballer paid the woman $375,000 for not saying anything about the incident, Der Spiegel published on Friday.
Hours after its publication, Ronaldo, 33, called this fake news in a live video from his Instagram account, which has 142 million followers.
“No, not a thousand times.
What was said today is false," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said on camera.
“People want to get to know each other by using my name.
It's normal,
They want to be famous just by saying my name, it's part of my job.
I’m a happy and respectable man,” the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they describe as "an inadmissible statement of suspicion in the area of privacy" according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for “moral damages in an amount commensurate with the gravity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years.”
The incident occurred in June 2019 in a suite at the Palm Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly anally raped her, according to documents filed in Nevada's Clark County District Court.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo, after the alleged incident, knelt down saying that he was 99% a gentleman, but that 1% had betrayed him.
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that the two men had consensual sex with each other.
Mayorga also maintains that she went to the police and that she had photographs of the injuries, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was terrified of reprisals and worried about public derision.
The 34-year-old woman says she is seeking to revoke the settlement while continuing to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged crime, Ronaldo was about to meet Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer he joined Italian giant Juve in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: Car manufacturers will leave the UK
The UK would forever regret the loss of its position as the world’s leading carmaker after Brexit, according to Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was worrying that Toyota UK had claimed on the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need to make a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said that in the event that Brexit did not reach any agreement, the impact of delays at the border could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models, produced about 150,000 vehicles last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
“In my opinion, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will be witnessing production stop at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s managing director in Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers have also expressed fear of leaving the EU without reaching an agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW confirmed that it would close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
One of the main concerns of car manufacturers is the risk of the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is very tight, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers for bespoke cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, the border could be affected and delays and shortages could result.
The company claims that it would be impossible for Toyota to maintain a normal pace for more than a day at the Derbyshire plant, so production would have to stop.
Clark claims that Theresa May’s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is “accurately calibrated to avoid such border controls.”
"It is essential to have an agreement. And we want it to be the best agreement, to enjoy the current success but also make the most of this opportunity," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
“The experience of Toyota and other manufacturers is that it is necessary to continue these excellent supply chains.”
Toyota could not estimate how long production would stop, but warned that in the long run the added costs would reduce the plant's competition and could even cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, Burnaston employee for 24 years and Unite union coordinator, said its members are increasingly concerned: “From experience, I know that once these jobs disappear, they never come back.
A government spokesman said they had put forward an accurate and credible plan for the future relationship between the UK and the EU.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again
The White House has said the high-stakes meeting of Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein could be delayed another week because of the fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, ties between Russia’s aides and Trump, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump fires the deputy attorney general or not, which would jeopardize Mueller’s independence, has stoked rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein spoke of using a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of impeaching the president through the 25th amendment.
However, Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, amid reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was in New York on Thursday.
Trump said he would prefer not to have to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a clash with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing witnessed by Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accuse him of sexual misconduct.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long probe of the FBI into allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying a Senate vote.
Sarah Sanders, Trump’s press secretary, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he replied: "There is still no set date, it could be this week or it could be a week late, given everything that is going on in the Supreme Court.
We’ll see, but you know I like to keep the press informed.”
Some journalists questioned that claim, as Sanders has been holding a press conference since September 10.
When asked by host Chris Wallace why,
Sanders said the lack of a briefing was not due to an aversion to the reporters' grandiloquence, but added that she would not be the one to deny that attitude.
He also suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president gives more interviews than the previous president," he said, although he did not cite any source who had endorsed the data.
Sanders continued, “If the press has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States directly, that’s much better than asking her questions.
You are witnesses to how we have been doing this for the past few weeks, and it will replace a press conference where you can speak directly to the President of the United States."
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
However, solo press conferences are rare.
Perhaps the president demonstrated the motive this week in New York, with a free and at times strange appearance before the assembled journalists.
A letter from the Ministry of Health to calm down the mood in the face of Brexit
The Health Secretariat has addressed a letter to EU workers in Scotland’s NHS expressing the country’s gratitude and communicating its wish that they stay in the country after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter less than six months before the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has committed to covering the cost of covered status applications for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal have continued, and decisions are expected to be reached this autumn.
However, the UK government, for its part, has also stepped up its preparations for a possible no-deal situation.
I know this is a time of trouble for everyone.
This is why I want to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each of the staff members, regardless of their nationality.
Our colleagues in the European Union and beyond bring undisputed expertise and skills that strengthen and enhance the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here with us.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after sustaining a head injury during Saturday's loss (31-27) to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee's Mike Organ reported.
Rod Reed, the Tennessee State coach, informed reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the break.
Apparently, he fainted upon reaching the band line.
Trainers and medical staff gave him oxygen on the sideline before taking him on a stretcher for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State technician informed Chris Harris, a WSMV reporter in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
He added that details of the type and extent of the injury are not yet available, and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a red jersey sophomore, is in his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five innings in total on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his season total to 18.
A stamp duty will be applied to foreign buyers who buy a property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when they buy a property in the UK. This additional money will be used to help homeless people under the new Conservative plans.
This measure will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters
The stamp duty increase will apply to those who do not pay tax in the UK.
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when they buy a property in the UK. Theresa May will announce that this additional money will be used to help the homeless.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters with promises to promote more affordable housing and focus on high-income people.
The tax increase will apply to people and businesses who do not pay tax in the UK, and the money raised will go towards supporting the government’s campaign to reduce the number of people sleeping on the streets.
The surcharge, which is added to the current stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second homes and rental purchases, could be up to 3%.
The exchange is expected to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
Approximately 13% of new construction in London is bought by non-UK residents, which is driving up prices and making it harder for first-time buyers to access the housing market.
Many wealthy areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a tax cut to help young people buy their first home.
He accused major construction companies of keeping house prices high by buying land and not using it, and urged Mrs May to remove tax revenue percentages on moderately priced houses to address the "shame on the housing sector" that is being experienced in Britain.
Mr Corbyn has announced an attractive series of housing reform proposals, including rent control and a ban on no-fault evictions.
He also wants to give councils greater powers when it comes to building new homes.
Mrs May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream: that life should be better for every new generation.
And for that, we need to fix the disastrous housing market.
“Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and start a life here.
However, it is not fair that it is as simple for people who do not live in the UK, as well as for companies based abroad, to buy homes that for working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home is too far away, and the indignity of not having a roof over one’s head remains too real.”
Jack Ross: 'My last ambition is to be able to coach Scotland'
Sunderland manager Jack Ross has stated that his "last ambition" is to become Scotland's manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot is enjoying the challenge of reviving the north-west club, which currently occupies third place in League One, three points away from the head.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“When I was a player, my dream was to play for my country.
I played once in the B team, and that was it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportssound programme.
“I grew up watching Scotland play at Hampden many times with my father when I was a kid, something I’ve always wanted to relive.
But that opportunity will only come if I succeed in running a club.”
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland manager included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic says he felt no concern about succeeding such established figures in such a large club after previously rejecting proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Will success for me at this point depend on whether I can return this club to the Premier League?
Because the structure and the facilities of the club are undoubtedly typical of a Premier League club," he said.
"It will not be an easy task to get here, but I will probably only consider that I have achieved success here if I can return the club to the Premier League."
Ross has only spent three years as head coach following a stint as an assistant coach at Dumbarton and a 15-month stint with the Hearts coaching staff.
In that period he helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third division and managed to get St Mirren from being on the verge of relegation to winning the Championship title the following season.
Ross claims to be more comfortable now than he has ever been during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“I was probably at a real crossroads,” he recalled, about taking over the Alloa.
“I really thought that training was perfect for me, even more than playing.
It sounds weird because it didn’t hurt me, I made a reasonably good living and enjoyed some successes.
But playing can be hard.
There are a lot of things you have to overcome each week.
I still suffer from the stress and pressure of work, but I like to train.
I’ve always enjoyed training and now that I’m doing it, I feel more comfortable than ever in my adult life.”

According to a survey, the perfect time to take a pint is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday.
The summer heat wave increased consumption in British pubs with more difficulty, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars saw growth of 2.7 percent during July, but consumption in restaurants fell 4.8 percent according to the figures.
Peter Martin, a member of the CGA trade advisory, who compiled the figures, said: "England's sunny days and longer-than-expected stay at the World Cup saw a similar pattern in July to that of June, with pubs enjoying a 2.8 per cent increase in consumption, although restaurants suffered an even greater punishment.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant turnover during June worsened during July.
Pubs and bars specialized in drinks were the ones that obtained the best results with increases in consumption higher than the reductions experienced by restaurants.
Pubs specializing in food also suffered from the sun, although not as dramatically as restaurant operators.
It’s like people just want to go out for a drink.
In controlled pubs and bars, beverage consumption increased by 6.6 percent during the month, and food consumption decreased by three percent.
Paul Newman, an employee of the leisure and hospitality activities analysis company RSM, said: “These results represent a continuation of the trend that has been occurring since the end of April.
The time and impact of major social and sporting events continue to be the main factors in relation to consumption outside the home.
Not surprisingly, restaurant groups continue to suffer, however, a drop of 4.8 percent per year will be especially painful if the continued increase in costs is added to this.
The long warm summer could not have come at a worse time for the catering business and the weather will be in charge of saying whether the moderation of temperatures experienced during August will provide the much-needed respite for the sector.
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent during July, reflecting a slowdown in brand launches.
The UK pub, bar and restaurant sector’s Coffer Peach Tracker Industry sales indicator collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups with combined profits of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion and is considered the industry benchmark.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that hide from their parents.
One in five children (some as young as 11) have secret social media accounts that conceal their parents and teachers according to a survey.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the number of "Fake Insta" pages.
This news has caused an increase in the fear of sexual content being published
Twenty percent of students said they had a “principal” account to show their parents
One in five children (some as young as 11) are creating social media accounts that keep adults secret.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a growth in the number of "fake Insta" accounts (referring to the photo-sharing social network Instagram).
This news has caused an increase in the fear of sexual content being published.
Twenty percent of students said they used a softened "main" account to show their parents while they had other private ones.
A mother who stumbled upon her 13-year-old daughter’s secret account found a teenage girl asking to be “raped.”
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 per cent of boys and girls aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: “It’s alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" on the Scottish Athletics Federation Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the council of the Scottish Athletics Federation as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the board of directors.
Doyle is Scotland’s most awarded athlete and President Ian Beattie has called this decision an excellent opportunity for those leading the sport to benefit from her extensive international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidh enjoys tremendous respect within the Scottish community, the UK and globally, and we are confident that Scottish athletics will benefit tremendously from their membership on the council,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I am looking forward to serving as a spokesperson for the athletes and I look forward to contributing to and helping lead the sport in Scotland.
The American, who won the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Games among a total of four Olympic golds and currently works as a regular commentator for the BBC, suffered a transient ischemic attack that prevented her from walking.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I suffered an apoplexy.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time could determine if I could recover and to what degree.
It was exhausting work, but I managed to recover completely, I learned to walk again and I currently do agility exercises.
Thanks for the messages of encouragement.”
An ad for a breast pump comparing women to cows divides public opinion on social media
A breast pump company has shared public opinion on the web with an ad comparing it to nursing mothers with cows being milked.
To announce the launch of the proclaimed "world's first silent portable breast pump", the company Elvie released an ironic music video-style ad to demonstrate the freedom the new breast pump offers mothers.
Four royal mothers dance in an ugly barn to the cows to the beat of a song with lyrics such as "Yes, I move myself, but I have no tail" and "In case you haven't noticed, they're not udders, they're my breasts."
The chorus continues: "Muge, muxe, I'm feeding the babies, muxe, muxe, I'm mumbling my friends."
However, the announcement, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, sparked controversy on social media.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video provoked different reactions among viewers. Many of them claimed that it highlights the "horrors" of the dairy sector.
“Using cows to advertise this product was a very mediocre decision.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, but in their case we steal their children days after giving birth,” one wrote.

Another viewer commented: "Clearly traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But yes, why aren’t they used to advertise a breast pump for the mothers who are left with their babies?”
Another spectator added: "What an announcement with so little tact."
Other viewers defended the ad, including one woman who said she thought the song was "very funny".
“I think it’s a great idea.
If I was still breast-feeding, I'd buy one.
The milk made me feel like a cow.
The announcement is a bit silly, but I take it as a joke.
“I think it’s a great product,” he wrote.
Another commented: "This is a fun ad aimed at mothers who express their milk (often at their workplaces or in restrooms) and feel like 'cows'.
This is not an ad to praise or judge the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, this group of women reveals that they have been dancing with the discreet extractors inserted in their fasteners.
The concept on which the campaign is based is that many women who express their milk claim to feel like cows.
However, the Elvie breast pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and can be discreetly fitted into a maternal breast pump, which gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies and even go out there while they are pumping their milk.
Ana Balarin, Partner and Executive Creative Director of Mother commented: “The Elvie extractor is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative release.
In describing the parallels between women and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on the extraction of milk and all the challenges involved while demonstrating in an entertaining and close way the incredible sense of freedom that the new extractor will offer.
It’s not the first time Elvie has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two paraded on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children have quietly moved to a camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has increased even though the monthly number of border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, in part because the strict rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to assign godparents to children.
Traditionally, most godparents were also undocumented immigrants and were afraid of jeopardizing their ability to stay in the country by stepping forward to claim a child.
This risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that prospective godparents and other adult members of their households would have to submit their fingerprints and that that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who asked to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
“Nearly 80 percent of the people who are godparents or who are part of the household of godparents are in the country illegally, and a large part of these are foreigners who have committed crimes.
Therefore, we will continue to pursue these individuals," Albence said.
In order to process the children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that will require any of these to appear in court before a month has passed since their arrest instead of 60 days, which was the previous rule, according to shelter workers.
Many will appear via video conference rather than in person to try to legalize their case before an immigration judge.
Those who do not meet the requirements for assistance will be quickly deported.
The longer they remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts according to shelter workers and system reports published over the past few months.
Lawyers said these fears are heightened in larger centers such as Tornillo, where symptoms of a child having a bad time are more likely to go unnoticed because of their size.
They also added that moving the children to the camping area without giving them enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could mean a trauma that many continue to suffer.
Syria calls on US, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, addressing the UN General Assembly, also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is currently in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also holds the post of Deputy Prime Minister, declared that foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they would "take care of them in a timely manner".
"They must withdraw immediately and without conditions," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have had to flee their homes.
He also said Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we clear all Syrian territories" of terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has approximately 2,000 troops in Syria, primarily to train and advise Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces that oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem declared that the right conditions were in place for their return and blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading irrational fears" that caused refugees not to return.
“We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not offer reconstruction aid to Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement reached between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral zone in Idlib's last major rebel stronghold has allowed political talks to continue.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a full-scale assault by Russian-backed Syrian troops on the province, which is home to three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed his hope that the military actions will target the jihadists, including the soldiers of the Al-Nusra front linked to Al-Qaeda, which "will be eradicated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and to facilitate elections.
Moualem outlined the conditions for ensuring the Syrian government's participation in the committee, stating that the body's work should be restricted to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warned of possible interference.
Trump will win a second term.
Following this logic, Mr. Trump would get re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberals will be expecting, the impeachment and scandals put an end to his presidency prematurely.
It was called “The Most Dramatic End of a Presidency.”
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue among the observers.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million viewers on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, an increase of 1.7 million over four years ago according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" led the ratings of cable channels with 3.5 million viewers during the nights when major news broke.
“It’s like a fire that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, showrunner of the ABC drama “Designated Survivor,” about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has another theory.
Remember a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election?
The driver said he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? he asked.
“He said, ‘Because it makes me laugh,’” Mrs. Scovell said.
There is entertainment in the chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else on television, the plots that emerge from Washington can determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, whether immigrant families can reunite, and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting from reality is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Still, it amounts to something beyond being an informed citizen to spend six hours watching a panel of experts debate Bob Woodward’s use of “anonymous” sources for his book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich-skin fire jacket (“a garment full of arrogance,” the Washington Pos.
I will never look at Super Mario again in the same way.
"Part of what makes it look like a reality show is that it's giving you something new every night," said Brent Montgomery, a senior executive at Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars," a space that deals with the daily character changes and plot twists of the Trump show (the conflict with the N.F.L., the praise for Kim Jong-un...).

When I got in touch with Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sunny and a temperature of 26 degrees outside on the north coast of Kauai, but he was locked in the house watching MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
He was unable to disengage while Brett Kavanaugh was on the verge of facing the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging by a thread.
“I remember when we were doing all those crazy shows back then and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Mr. Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was a bit of a joke, but it turns out they were right.”

Foreign money comes to moreas to finance the candidacies to the Chamber for the elections of the half of the legislature
Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania's 17th congressional district is receiving a large influx of money due to the reorganization of a congressional district with two representatives running for the same seat.
This newly reorganized district on the outskirts of Pittsburg is represented by Democratic candidate Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election held last spring.
Lamb presents himself against another acting representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th District of Pennsylvania, which is largely superimposed over the new 17th District.
The maps were reorganized after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that Republicans had manipulated the electoral district of the old districts in their favor.
The election race in the new 17th congressional district sparked a campaign finance festival among the main financial arms of the parties, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after achieving a close victory in the March special election for the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania, which enjoyed a wide following.
That seat was held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political pundits give Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States valued the possibility of penalizing El Salvador for its support for China, and then backed down.
Diplomats warned that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a pleasant meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and even owned a hotel in Panama until his partners kicked off the Trump Organization’s management team.
U.S. State Department officials have ordered the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama to return "due to recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan," State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
However, only the possibility of applying sanctions against El Salvador, which received approximately 140 million dollars of U.S. aid during 2017, including to control drug trafficking, development and economic aid, was considered.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and visa restrictions, would be very negative for the Central American country and its high rates of unemployment and murders.
As internal meetings progressed, U.S. and Central American officials postponed holding a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent people from migrating to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear they wanted the conference to move forward, effectively ending any possibility of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to lead the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, in a sign of the importance the administration attaches to it, diplomats said.
The three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any harsh new messages or punishment from Washington.
A spokesman for Bolton’s White House declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to talk about the internal deliberations as long as the anonymity of the participants was maintained.
His accounts were corroborated by an external analyst close to the administration who also agreed to speak as long as his anonymity was preserved.
Studying History
The next negative case could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on the case of possible obstruction of justice of Mr. Trump, of which there is currently abundant evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller is also reportedly directing his investigation to find out whether Mr. Trump’s campaign conspired with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will have to answer to that body, just when he has to prepare for the elections, and he may finally have to face a popular jury.
There are many unknowns and I do not want to suggest that Mr. Trump’s downfall is inevitable, as is that of his European counterparts.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the length of the battle.
In 1938, German officers were determined to stage a coup against Hitler if the Western Front resisted and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We have failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The course of history revolves around these turning points, and the inexorable advance of democracy accelerates or recedes.
Americans are facing several of these turning points at this time.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been carrying water up to his neck since this newspaper reported that last year he suggested secretly recording the president and speculated that he was incapacitated for the job.
Mr. Rosenstein stated that the information in The Times is not true.
“How will we respond if the FBI’s just-requested investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not completed or unbiased, or if his appointment to the Supreme Court is confirmed despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and false witness testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that holds Mr. Trump accountable?
If we do not pass these tests, democracy will be subjected to a long winter.
But I think we will not fail, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that also occupied my home, which was the headquarters of the embassy.
He survived, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to light Shabbat candles on that table that included a swastika.
With that legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?”

Rangers player Graham Dorrans is optimistic about the match against Rapid Vienna
Rangers host Rapid Vienna on Thursday knowing that a win against the Austrians, after the impressive draw against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, would put them in a very favourable position to qualify in Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his debut this season until a 2–2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use that result as a springboard to achieve more important things.
"It was a good point for us, as Villarreal are a good team," the 31-year-old said.
“We came into the game believing we could achieve something positive and we reached a point.
We had a chance to win in the end, but overall the draw is probably a fair result.
We were better in the first half, but we were better in the second.
Next week is going to be another big night.
We hope we can get all three points, but it will be difficult, because they got a good result in their last game, but with the support of our public, I’m sure we can fight to get a positive result.
“Last year was tough between everything that happened with my injuries and the changes in the team, but there is an excellent atmosphere at the moment.
The team is good, the guys are having a good time and the training is good.
We hope we can fight, forget last season and be successful.”
Women are worried about their retirement savings.
Despite the fact that survey participants were clear about how they wanted to be cared for, few people spoke to their family about the matter.
Approximately half of the participants in this study conducted by Nationwide said that they commented with their partners on the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about the issue.
“People want to be looked after by a family member, but they’re not taking the necessary steps to have that conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
You can start with the next one.
Talk to your partner and children: You can’t prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t tell them your wishes well in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to agree on where and how to receive care, as these decisions can be a determining factor in determining the cost.
Call your financial advisor: Your financial advisor can also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Among the extended care financing options are a traditional extended care insurance policy, a cash-value hybrid life insurance policy to help cover these expenses, or self-insurance covered with your own funds, provided you have the money.
Negotiate your legal documents: Avoid legal battles.
Get a health care representative to appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical care and make sure the professionals fulfill your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
It also allows you to sign a notarial power of attorney to manage your finances.
You will need to choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid if you are incapacitated.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that your older father or mother has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be in a position to answer questions about your medications and allergies?
Write down this information in a written plan to be prepared.
“Not only is the financial issue at stake, but who are the doctors who take care of it?” asked Martin.

Who will take care of the dog?
Make a plan.”
Man shot with air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot multiple times with an air rifle while walking back home after going out at night.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Officers described the shooting, which occurred at approximately 02:30 British summer time, as a "random act".
The victim did not see the assailant.
His injuries are not serious and police are looking for possible witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
A powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to official sources, killed at least 384 people, a figure that is expected to continue to rise.
Due to the communications cut, rescuers were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala regency, an area north of Palu that is closest to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude quake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an approximate population of 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency that lies along more than 300 km of coastline northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
This regency, an administrative region smaller than a province, had a population of approximately 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the mainstays of the economy of the Central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but are concentrated mainly in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years according to Indonesia’s Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire of high seismic activity, so it regularly suffers earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004 - A major earthquake off the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26th caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries, killing 226,000 people off the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that devastated the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009 – A 7.6 magnitude earthquake strikes near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed approximately 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake affected the Pidie Jaya regency, located in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, as people recalled the devastation caused by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
There were no tsunamis, but more than 100 people were killed when buildings collapsed.
2018: Major earthquakes occurred on the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, resulting in the deaths of more than 500 people, most of them in the northern part of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists stranded temporarily.
Sarah Palin's Son Arrested on Domestic Violence Charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, preventing a complaint of domestic violence and resisting authority, according to a memo released by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, the police removed her phone.
Palin remains in pretrial detention at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility on $500 bail, KTUU reported.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, in which he pleaded "not guilty at all" when asked, the jail reported.
Palin faces three Type A misdemeanors, which means he could be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with a type B misdemeanor, punishable by one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, preventing a complaint of domestic violence, and possession of weapons while drunk in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of punching him in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after linking her son's violent behavior to the post-traumatic stress disorder syndrome he suffers from after serving with the army in Iraq.
An earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia have killed hundreds of people.
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not available, and the death toll is expected to rise over the next few days.
The quake struck just off Sulawesi Central, northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
Videos are circulated through social networks in which the moment of impact is shown.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a festival on the beach in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
U.S. Attorneys Seek Rare Death Penalty for Suspect in New York Terrorist Attack
New York federal prosecutors are trying to impose the death penalty on Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people, a penalty that has not been carried out in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike lane on Lower Manhattan's West Side Highway, taking the lives of pedestrians and cyclists he encountered on his way in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed the eight victims and “intentionally” seriously injured them, according to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both crimes imply the possibility of applying the death penalty according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury presented Saipov with an indictment for 22 crimes, including eight counts of murder in collaboration with an organized crime group, a practice commonly used by prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "remarkable planning and premeditation", the prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried out the "atrocious, cruel and depraved" attack.
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the statement said.
Five of the victims were tourists.
The Southern District of New York has not prosecuted a death penalty case for a decade.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a federal case in New York was in 1953, in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a marriage that was executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed a lack of repentance during the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities that in order to carry out the attack, he was inspired by the ISIS videos he viewed on his phone according to the indictment.
He also asked to be allowed to see the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal ex-officio attorneys charged with representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a life sentence conviction without the possibility of revocation will only prolong the trauma caused by these events for all those involved,” Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be put at the helm of Brexit talks
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize an army of people" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former leader of Britain's Independence Party said politicians had to "feel the pressure" from eurosceptics (when one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested she should take over negotiations with the EU).
MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham rally that the UK “would have left the EU already” if Mr Farage were the Brexit secretary.
But Mrs May’s challenge to reconcile her party’s divided ranks has been highlighted by joining pro-EU Tories at an independent Brexit protest in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep the commitments of her Chequers plan between the attacks of Brexiteers, opponents and the EU.
His allies insisted that he keep fighting to try to get a deal with Brussels despite the negative response, to force the Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between his plan and chaos.
Mr. Bone stated at the Solihull Leave Means Leave rally that he wanted to end Chequers' plan.
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been counted on to take responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If I had given him the job, we would be out of the EU by now," he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: "I will continue to stand for Brexit, but we must abort the Chequers plan".
Showing his opposition to the EU, he stated the following: "We do not fight world wars to be served.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr Bone denied suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely false”.
Tory member and Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns also attended the march, telling reporters: “All I’m saying is: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The Chequers plan is not popular with the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular with our party and our activists who, to begin with, are the ones who occupy the streets and allow us to be elected.
Cancel the Chequers plan and start listening.”
In a message to Mrs May, he added: "Prime Ministers retain their jobs when they keep their promises".
Mr Farage said in the rally that it was necessary to make politicians "feel uncomfortable" if they intended to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
“Today, this is an issue of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They are trying to betray the Brexit decision and here we are meeting today to tell them that we will not let them get away with it.”
In a message to an enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, who are on the verge of betraying the Brexit decision, uncomfortable.
“We are mobilizing the army of people in this country who gave us victory in Brexit and who will not rest until we become a proud, independent and self-governing Britain.”
Meanwhile, supporters of remaining in the EU marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A few activists waved placards with the message Tories Against Brexit after the group’s launch this weekend.
Labour's Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security problems they suffered in a party application at the start of the conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems in order and all the best technology for Canada, to have a frictionless border, to enjoy a free market without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“This is an absolute farce.
The concept of a good Brexit does not exist,” he added.
Warren plans to seriously think or run for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will seriously consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future Saturday during a town hall session in a western Massachusetts town.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump’s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She has been the focus of speculations that place her as Trump’s successor in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with his constituents using the town hall format since Trump took office.
An assistant asked him if he planned to introduce himself to the president.
Warren responded that it is time for “women to go to Washington to fix our government’s problems, and that requires a woman in the office of the presidency.”
Arrested in connection with the shooting of LSU player Sims
Baton Rouge police announced Saturday that a suspect was arrested for the murder of Wayde Sims, the LSU basketball player, on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at a press conference held at 11:00 a.m.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday asking for help identifying a man in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday.
“Wayde Sims sustained a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died as a result,” Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media Saturday through 247sports.
Wayde interposed to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being present at the scene with a gun and admitted shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 2-meter junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title thanks to the team orders, which allowed him to achieve victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' team orders would prove decisive in the race.
Bottas, who was starting from pole, had a good start and almost left Hamilton alone while defending his position during the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel pitted first and let Hamilton run with traffic at the rear of the group, something that would prove decisive.
The Mercedes pitted a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtook him after several wheel-to-wheel manoeuvres which caused the Ferrari driver to reluctantly leave the interior free at the risk of being delayed after a double defensive manoeuvre in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the last row of the starting grid and climbed up to seventh at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led the race for a large part of this thanks to which he kept his tyres to be able to go faster in the final part and overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth position.
He eventually pitted on lap 44 but could not advance any position over the last eight laps, which ended with Raikkonen in fourth place.
It was a difficult day, because Valtteri did an excellent job throughout the weekend and was a real gentleman.
The team did an extraordinary job to get the first two places,” said Hamilton.
Improper body language
President Donald Trump mocked Sen. Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for her insistence that she had not leaked Christine Blasey Ford’s letter accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
In a speech at an event in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly about Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee and instead commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were "miserable, disgusting and lying".
“The only thing that could have happened and the most beautiful thing that is happening in recent days in the Senate, when you see the indignation, when you see the people who are angry and who are miserable, disgusting and lying,” he said.
“When you see these publications and leaks and they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t go.
I did not go.”
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you done any leaking?
Do you remember his answer... did you leak the document?: "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, no, no.
I did not go.
Wait just a moment.
“No,” he said, imitating the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter detailing allegations against Kavanaugh made by Ford in July and leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t leak her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“I asked you to keep it confidential and I did what you asked me to do.”
But his denial didn’t seem to sit well with the president, who commented the following during Saturday night’s act: “I’m telling you that body language wasn’t the right thing to do.
I may not have leaked it, but I used the worst body language I've ever seen in my life."
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that Democrats were using the allegations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
They are evil and disgusting, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to run over in order to regain power and control,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars looked back on Friday's Elite League loss to the Belfast Giants by winning the second leg 5–3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants got an early lead with two goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied for the home team before Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard drew for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals allowed them to take the win.
It was the third Elite League loss of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who managed to come back to beat Dundee 2–1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with a balance of the previous three wins in favor of the Giants.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the 3:35 mark thanks to an assist from Kendall McFaull, and the second came four minutes later from Beauvillier following David Rutherford's assist.
In an initial hectic period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt assisted Cownie to score the draw goal at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants got ahead before the first half when he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard returned to tie the game with a power play goal in the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen overtake Dundee for the first time in the match at the end of the second period and secured victory with their team's fifth goal in the latter half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play their next game at Milton Keynes on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies to ensure that hundreds of passengers on a plane can escape an earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller considered a hero after his death to ensure that a plane loaded with hundreds of passengers could take off safely.
The death toll is 800 and there are many missing after a major earthquake shook the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to be felt in the area and many people are trapped under the rubble of the city of Palu.
Although his co-workers fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to abandon his post in the control tower of Palu’s violently swinging Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport.
He remained at his post to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
Then he jumped off the control tower when he thought it was going to collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take you to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“It breaks my heart to hear it,” he said.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could be in the thousands and the country's disaster management agency has said access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The death toll is believed to continue to rise because there are many bodies under the rubble and many have not been reached,” agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
Waves of up to six meters devastated Palu, where a mass burial will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are transporting aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance is bringing bodies.
Drinking water is scarce.
People are stealing from the mini-markets.”
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is fighting to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
This is a tragedy, but it could get much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the Indonesian military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" he told CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia suffered earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now claims there is a missing person after a plane crash in a lagoon
The airline that operates a flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now claims there is one missing after previously claiming that the 47 passengers and crew left the sinking plane without incident.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they were unable to locate a passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as their age or nationality.
Boats in the area helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Authorities said Friday that seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained at the hospital on Saturday and all were stable.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy confirmed that the plane landed in the lagoon before reaching the airstrip.
Some witnesses claim that the plane missed the runway.
Bill Jaynes, a passenger of American nationality, commented that he entered with very little height.
"That's an extremely positive thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and other passengers were able to move through waist-deep water to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also recalled that the flight attendants were screaming and frightened, and that he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy indicated that sailors who were working near the site on dock improvement tasks also assisted in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to move people to shore before the plane sank about 100 feet (30 m).
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in registered airline accidents in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none have affected Air Niugini.
An analyst wrote the chronology of the night a woman was burned alive.
The prosecution referred to the evidence on Saturday in the retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
During the trial he described to the jury how he used mobile phone records to piece together the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of his death.
Rowlett stated that he received location data from several mobile phones showing that Tellis was meeting with Chambers on the night of his death contradicting his earlier claims as reported by The Clarion Ledger newspaper.
When this data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford took the stand on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecution asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he stated that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Cell phone records indicated that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett stated that sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis removed Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He's got it out of his system," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped the trial would be seen for sentencing by the jury that same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the genre's negative perception by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, a group from Bristol, claims that hip hop has moved away from its origins with political messages and struggles against social problems.
They want to go back to their roots and get combative hip hop back to being popular.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently experienced a resurgence in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?
New York City childcare worker sues couple after ‘racist’ message
A New York City childcare provider is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a message not addressed to her from her mother complaining that she was “another black woman.”
The couple denies being racist and compares the demand with "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed her anguish at discovering that childcare provider Giselle Maurice was black when she showed up for her first day of work in 2016.
“NOOOOOOOOOOON, ANOTHER BLACK,” Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
Upon realizing her mistake, an "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, stating that the caretaker who had just left, who was African-American, had done her job wrong and that she expected a Filipino according to the New York Post announcement.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for the day's work and sent home in an Uber.
Now Maurice is suing the couple for severance pay and demanding compensation of $350 a day for the six months of internal work for which she was initially hired even though there was no contract in between.
“Look, I want to show you that these things are not done,” he told the Post on Friday, later adding, “It’s a case of discrimination.”
The couple responded to accusations of racism by stating that firing Maurice was the most reasonable, as they were afraid of not being able to trust her after offending her.
"My wife had sent him a message that I had no intention of sending her.
It's not racist.
We are not racists,” her husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would they leave their children in the hands of a person they offended, even if it was due to a mistake?
Is your baby just born?
Come on!"
After comparing the lawsuit to "extortion," Plasco said his wife had just had a baby two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation."
“Did you go for someone like that?”
That’s not very ethical,” the investment banker added.
While the legal process continues, the court of public opinion quickly denounced the couple on social networks, attacking them for their behavior and applied logic.
Paddington's editors feared that readers would not identify with a talking bear as can be concluded in a new letter.
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented on the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone reading it for the first time before it was published.
It’s very funny now to know what we know about Paddington’s huge success.”
Claiming that his father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book about a small toy bear, would be optimistic that his work would be rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the books' publication was "bittersweet" after his death last year.
De Paddington, whom he describes as a "very important member of our family", added that his father was quietly proud of the success he eventually achieved.
“He was a quiet man and not presumptuous,” she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if you had a son who got something: you're proud even if you didn't really do it yourself.
I think I felt Paddington's success a little bit that way.
Although it was a creation of his own and a product of his imagination, he always gave all the credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye over the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to Louis Pasteur Hospital 2 in Nice, where doctors worked unsuccessfully to save her life.
“Nad called regularly to say he was very ill, that he was not expected to survive.
“Then I got the call from Nad to tell me that I was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, my love.
I'll meet you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines doctors had given him to keep his heart beating were slowly being consumed and leaving his body.
He had died a while before, and now he was dying.
I just had to sit back and wait, knowing what was going on.
I couldn’t cry or scream because I was surrounded by people.
I had to hold on.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, in that moment of mourning for the loss of her daughter, got on the plane with the other passengers, without noticing the ordeal she was suffering.
“No one detected it,” he said.
My head was down and I was crying all the time.
It is difficult to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt this impressive sense of solidarity for Nad.
I needed your love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved her.”
Postcards from distressed women to prevent suicides on a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been placing cards on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers to call for help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and committed suicide at 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel like I have to feel every day,” he said.
Mrs Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, commented that her son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said their smile lit up any room.”
However, he left work before he died and was "in very deep depression".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one who found his brother after he committed suicide.
Ms. Davis commented, “I have ongoing concerns that there is a side effect.”
Mrs. Davis created the cards "to inform people that there are people they can go to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don’t be silent, you need to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after the death of her mother.
“He didn’t tell me he was sad or depressed or anything like that,” she said.
"A couple of days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
Christmas Day hit rock bottom (when the kids opened their presents, he didn’t make eye contact with them or anything).”
He claimed that his death was a huge trauma for them, but they must overcome it: "He tore the family apart.
Unwound us.
We have to go forward and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation.
“I thought that if we could get something like what I was asking for (a limited-time, limited-scope investigation), it’s possible that we could get a little bit of unity,” Mr. Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would be “cracking down” due to the shutdown of supporters.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican sympathizers want the FBI to conduct the investigation?
Their reluctance is due to a matter of deadlines.
There are five weeks until the midterm elections (November 6). If, as expected, the Republicans get bad results, they will be severely weakened in their attempts to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has been calling senators, lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, thanks to whom he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush’s personal secretary.
What will happen when the FBI takes action?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently holds 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can reach at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break the tie and confirm it for the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean defectors falls under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors bound for South Korea has dropped since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea’s unification ministry, said there had been 1,127 defections over the past year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China and the increase in tariffs charged by people crossing the border were key factors.
Pyongyang has made no public comment.
The vast majority of defectors from the North are eventually offered citizenship of South Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them flee through China, which has the largest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South (which technically remain at war) have improved markedly over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks focused on negotiations on the elimination of parked nuclear weapons.
This came after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, at which they roughly agreed to work towards eliminating nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S.-imposed sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
“If we don’t have confidence in the United States, we can’t trust our national security, and in those circumstances, there is no chance at all that we will unilaterally disarm first,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and says he’s not fit for the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was not fit by nature to stand on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the remarks in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but think that if a woman ever behaved that way, they would call her hysterical,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations of sexual abuse of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During the initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes almost screaming and staying if talking while describing his family and his years of high school.
He also explicitly condemned the committee’s Democrats, calling the allegations against him a “grotesque and coordinated reputation assassination” organized by liberals angered by Hillary Clinton’s defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi stated that she believed Kavanaugh's statement showed that she could not access the Supreme Court because it showed she was biased against Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and with the way he attacked Clinton and the Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi objected when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he is confirmed in office and if Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives.
“What I have to say is this: If you’re not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then you’re not fit to be not only on the Supreme Court, but in the court you’re currently in,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the Washington D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about possible resolutions Kavanaugh might take against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In the confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh dodged questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
“This is not the time for a hysterical, prejudiced person to go to court and still expect us to say, ‘OK!’”
Women need to exercise.
It is a justified diatribe, months and years of overflowing fury, and you cannot drive it out without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's that weird, do you?"
He went on to say, "I got a lot of help from a woman who was an executive somewhere, who said she also cried when she was angry, but she developed a technique where when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, 'Maybe you're thinking I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And then, it continued.
It looked brilliant.”
Tears are allowed as an escape valve for anger in part because they are essentially not understood.
One of my clearest recollections in one of my first jobs in a male-dominated office, in which I began to cry with an anger impossible to describe, was that an older woman grabbed me from the back of the neck, a distant superior who had always given me a slight fright, and led me up the stairwell.
“Don’t ever let anyone see you cry,” he said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll comfort you if they come to you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential bids.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught up in an out-of-wedlock affair on a ship named Monkey Business and was removed from the presidential race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought there was no reason why she could not consider running for president.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” he said with a laugh 30 years later.
“There were already seven candidates in the race and the last one they needed was another one.
It was called "Brancaneves and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because the campaign was overdue, he was delayed in raising funds, so he swore he would not enter the race for the presidency unless he managed to raise $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
She found that some of her supporters contributed $1,000 to the male candidates, only giving her $250.
“What do you think, I have a discount?” he asked.
When she made her speech announcing that she would not be running a formal campaign, she was overwhelmed by the emotions (of gratitude to the people who supported her, of frustration with the system that made it difficult to raise money and address voters rather than delegates, and of anger at the existing sexism) that she was left speechless.
“You’d think she’d had a nervous breakdown,” Ms. Schroeder recalled how the press reacted to her.
“You’d think Kleenex was my sponsor company.
I remember thinking, what are they going to write on my tombstone?
"Crying?"
How the U.S.-China trade war with Beijing can be positive
The initial bombings of the U.S.-China trade war have been deafening, and although the war is far from over, a distance between the countries may prove beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with the application of new tariffs that affect the equivalent of 200 billion dollars, taxing half of the articles that come to the United States from China.
Beijing has struck back in the same way each time, the most recent raising tariffs from five to ten percent on $60 billion of American goods.
China has promised to emulate US measures and it seems unlikely that the world’s second-largest economy will falter in the short term.
In order to get Washington to back down, it would be necessary to give in to their demands, but to bow publicly to the United States would be much more shameful for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Even so, experts say that if Beijing knows how to play its cards correctly, the pressures of the trade war with the United States could favor China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions necessary to start an economic crisis in both countries is actually much more dangerous than previously recognized,” said Abigail Grace, an Asia-focused researcher at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Syria 'ready' for refugees to return, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild the country ravaged by more than seven years of war.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem stated that the country's conditions are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is much more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by the terrorists to restore normalcy.
All the necessary conditions are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they have been forced to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another 6 million people continue to live in the country and are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would appreciate the help it can receive to rebuild a country that is devastated.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup defeating the American team by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National club located on the outskirts of Paris, France.
It is the sixth consecutive U.S. loss on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who was the most battled during the tournament, sent the ball into the water in the 16th par 3 hole, losing his match to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer has shone in all of his series, becoming one of only four players to score a 5-0-0 since the current tournament format was implemented in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5&4 by the European team's worst-ranked player, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The first ranked player in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2&1 to Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played in his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran with eight Ryder Cups played, Spain's Sergio Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a became the European player with the most wins of the tournament, with 25.5 points.
"I don't cry often, but I can't help it today.
It's been a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to be able to get the cup back.
The important thing is the team, and I’m glad I could have helped,” Garcia said after the European victory.
He passed the baton on to his compatriot John Ram, who managed to defeat American golf legend Tiger Woods by 2&1 in Sunday's singles match.
"It's amazing how proud I am today that I was able to beat Tiger Woods. I grew up watching that boy play," said Rahm, 23.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a 13–21–3 record in the Ryder Cup.
This is a strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, winner of 14 majors, just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American team struggled throughout the weekend to stay on the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played golf of a high caliber throughout the tournament.
United States captain Jim Furyk said after his team's frustrating performance: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning, the Europeans were in trouble.
We fought.
I take off my hat to Thomas.
He is an excellent captain.
All 12 players played well.
We will reorganize, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and move forward.
"I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be captain.
It's to get the hat off.
They were superior.”
Red tide information: Concentrations are decreasing in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
According to the most recent report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, there is a general reduction in red tide concentrations in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the commission, increasingly uneven upwelling conditions are being observed in the Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties areas, which may mean that concentrations are decreasing.
The red tide extends approximately 210 km from the coast from the northern counties of Pinellas to the southern counties of Lee.
Concentrations of 10 miles (16 km) can be found off the coast of Hillsboroug County, but in fewer places compared to last week.
The red tide was also found in Pasco County.
Mid-level concentrations were reported on the coast or off the coast of Pinellas County last week, bottom and high concentrations were reported off the coast of Hillsborough County, bottom and high concentrations were reported on or off the coast of Sarasota County, bottom and low-level concentrations were reported on Charlotte County, bottom and high concentrations were reported on or off the coast of Hillsborough County, and bottom and high concentrations were reported on or off the coast of Collier County.
In Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier counties, reports of respiratory irritation continue to occur.
No such cases have been reported in Northwestern Florida in the past week.
