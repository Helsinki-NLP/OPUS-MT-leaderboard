Parliament did not support an amendment to free Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian Parliament today rejected the proposal to repeal the amendment to the section of the Criminal Code condemning opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.
The amendment would open the door to the release of the former prime minister, but MPs rejected the proposal to reduce penalties for economic crimes in the second reading.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for allegedly signing an agreement with Russia disadvantageous to Ukraine on the purchase of natural gas.
The sentence is not yet final, the appellate court has the obligation to review it in December.
Tymoshenko was convinced that it was a political revenge of the regime, and even in the West doubts have arisen about the impartiality of the court.
The proposal to withdraw paragraph 365 of the Criminal Code condemning the former Prime Minister was supported by 147 MPs in the vote.
A total of 226 votes were required for approval.
The Victory of Libya
The story of the Libyan liberation, or Libyan rebellion, already has its losers.
Muammar Gaddafi was buried in a secret place in the desert and without him there is no war.
It remains to be seen who the winner is.
As is already the custom in the region, the Islamists won the elections, but now it is a question of elucidating whether they are moderates or radicals.
The National Transitional Council has brought into force the traditional law, the sharia, which we already know in a way.
Libya will become a crime-free country, because thieves will have their hands cut off.
Women can already forget about emancipating themselves and apostates waiting for their execution and so on.
Instead of by the person of the dictator, society, composed of warring tribes, will be united by the Qur’an.
In Libya an order will be established that we cannot even imagine and that we certainly cannot.
However, our way of life is neither the only one nor objectively the best and, probably, it did not suit, instead, the Libyans already mentioned.
The truth is that it is not surprising that the Islamic fighters gratefully accepted the help of the infidel dogs.
The only justification was that, from their point of view, the NATO attacks were not directed by an American general, but great be Allah, whose greatness they celebrated after each of the successful interventions.
When looking for winners in Libya, the West is not among them.
We are caught in a firefight that Islamists and our politicians are using to get rid of a dictator in the person of a political ally with no guarantee of profit.
After the recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we did not occupy Libya militarily.
In this case, the locals do not have a problem expelling the "crusaders"
But, without occupation, will the oil companies manage to get hold of Libyan black gold with only good words?
Quite possibly not, but it may be that the West can finally boast of protecting human rights.
As long as the followers of Sharia don’t come across us.
A new era of crisis begins
France and the rest of Europe go on the hunt for the seeker of investors
A statistical whirlwind has spread across Europe
Individual states have released their GDP data for Q3.
The Czech economy in the four-month period has stagnated, while France and Germany have grown.
However, the bond market today has broken records.
Investors are no longer looking only at Italy, but also at Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the Eurozone, Germany, the Czech Republic and other European countries have already published their preliminary estimates on economic growth in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by 0.5%, France's by 0.4%
Both countries have made public the data of the second quarter, in Germany it has improved more than expected (0.3% growth instead of the expected 0.1%), although in France there was a slight reduction of 0.1% (the original data spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew 1.5% year-on-year in the third quarter of this year.
However, in the quarter-on-quarter period, the gross domestic product (GDP) has stagnated and according to the <0xC4><0x8C>S<0xC3><0x9A> there is a gradual slowdown in the growth of economic development.
The results are even worse than analysts’ forecasts.
Main events:
Year-on-year, the Czech economy grew in the third quarter of this year by 1.5%, but quarterly it has stagnated.
In the third quarter, the German economy, according to previous data and recalculated seasonally, grew by 0.5%.
The economy of the Eurozone and also of the European Union, between July and September and compared to the previous quarter, grew by 0.2%, which is in line with the expectations of analysts.
The Greek economy has fallen by 5.2% year-on-year.
The interest on your ten-year bonds is 28.45%.
Interest in Italian and Spanish bonds has grown to critical limits.
The problematic situation is also beginning to affect Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc.
Interest on Czech ten-year bonds remains at 4%, although the situation in the area is worsening.
In Germany, voices are rising that say the ECB should ultimately grant loans.
The Czechs qualify for the Euro.
They won 1:0 and celebrate the classification with a 200 million bonus.
The football team fulfills the most difficult task of the entire season!
In Montenegro, thanks to the excellent <0xC4><0x8C>ech and the brilliant goalkeeper Petr Jirá<0xC4><0x8D>ek, the victory was given by 1:0.
The Czech team, together with a good dose of luck in the second half, defended fantastically from the attacks of the home team, so it will not miss the appointment of the European championship.
IHNED.cz followed in detail the development of the party in a thorough report.
There was almost no excitement in the first half and a good dose of luck in the second.
The Czech team, thanks to the collapse of the home team towards the end, and also to the excellent game of <0xC4><0x8C>ech and the heroic Jirá<0xC4><0x8D>ek, won 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates its move to the European Championship.
Because of the very correct Czech defense, the Montenegrins did not press until the second half.
The two injured in the match were Damjanovi<0xC4><0x8D> and Vu<0xC4><0x8D>ini<0xC4><0x8D>, who missed two big chances.
In addition, thanks to the great Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech, the Czech eleven will not miss the appointment of the European Cup, so that the coffers of national football will receive an approximate gratification of 200 million crowns.
The first few minutes were a good offensive game.
Both teams worked hard just to maintain the lines and played nothing else around the center of the field.
There was no pressure from the local players in the first half, kicks to the other field in defense, just what the Czech defense was able to avoid.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country’s nuclear program.
They formed a human shield.
Several hundred university students formed human shields around nuclear facilities in Iran.
With their gesture they want to express their support for their country's nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
The students began praying Tuesday at noon outside the facility and then chanted death slogans to the U.S. and Israel.
Several hundred university students formed human shields Tuesday in the Iranian city of Isfahan around the nuclear technology center that works with uranium.
They want to show that they are willing to defend their country’s nuclear program with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in a recent report, found that Iran, by all indications, is striving for nuclear weapons.
In Israel there is talk of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
The students began praying at noon outside the Isfahan nuclear facilities and then launched death slogans against the US and Israel.
In the event of an attack, the aim of which would be to cripple Iran’s nuclear program, according to Israeli sources, not only the Isfahan plant would be reached, but also the Natanz facility, where uranium is enriched.
Daily menu of an obese child: no breakfast and dinner sausages
More than a third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 are overweight, with overweight affecting 9% of the school population and obesity 5%.
Obese children mostly come from families with an unhealthy lifestyle, according to current research.
It demonstrates again the importance of the environment where it is grown for a healthy development of the person, as well as the models that serve as a reference.
At the table, obsessed children eat, for example, sausages at least twice as often as children of normal-weight families.
For dinner, more than 19 percent of the obese had eaten fries the day before the analysis, which is linked to the prevention program "Obesity is not a coincidence."
In families of overweight children there is no habit of playing sports, which is applicable to most families today, where only 15% of children answered that their parents, at least once a week, find time for physical exercise.
Survey of 900 children
The survey was conducted at the end of last school year and involved nearly 900 primary school children from all over the Czech Republic.
It was already the second edition of the program "Obesity is not a coincidence", which supports the General Health Insurance Company and the Unilever company.
So far, more than 12,000 children from 4th to 8th grade have participated in the project.
A proper diet and plenty of family exercise are determining factors, which significantly reduce the number of overweight and even obese children.
"Only half of the children surveyed have answered that they have five meals a day according to the regime: breakfast, lunch, lunch, snack and dinner, which is one of the basic conditions for a healthy diet," collects one of the results of the survey.
No breakfast but with sausage for dinner
Specialists warn that, in a healthy development, the details are also important, which also count, such as having a fixed time for family breakfast.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23% of school families eat breakfast at the same time.
In most families, everyone eats breakfast alone.
But the worst thing was to find out that in 10% of households nothing is eaten for breakfast.
Breakfast is, however, the basis of a correct daily diet.
The study shows that families of obese children consume unhealthy French fries much more frequently.
Almost everyone – regardless of weight – drinks sweet soft drinks (70%) on a daily basis.
As a rule, more than 40% of the children surveyed do sports, however, among their parents this result is reduced to less than half, only 15%.
Make up your diet
The next phase of the study allowed the chosen boys (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to create their own diets from all possible offers according to their tastes and opinions.
"The food preferences of Czech children aged between 12 and 15 years, from the point of view of healthy eating, are far from ideal."
Among his favorite foods are pasta, meat and sweets
“The popularity of sweet soft drinks is especially alarming,” the study’s final report warns.
As the main food, the palm takes the pasta and is closely followed by the poultry meat.
Practically, children always reject legumes and the taste for fish and vegetables is very low.
Change to healthy habits
At the same time, the study shows that children are willing to change their eating habits if they receive the right information.
"In the control group of study participants, who filled out the questionnaire after finishing the prevention program 'Obesity is not a coincidence,' there was in many cases a significant change in favor of the principles of healthy eating," the study results said.
It draws attention, for example, regarding sweet soft drinks, where many children would begin to prefer normal and running water.
Children would also choose poultry and fish for the main meal more frequently in the questionnaire and restrict consumption of sweet food and flour derivatives.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, say the professionals
In the introductory article, How Stylists Learn, I already complained a little that the initial lessons were already quite loaded.
I had no idea how that would go.
Conferences by three professionals in the field, how to dress problematic characters and, in addition, a seminar on how it works in the world of entertainment.
And it will be worse.
The closer the final exams are, the more information and practical tasks await us
And although the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, there is no longer a pin.
We have once studied with the director, Alena, (in the course there is no man) how to dress the woman who does not have a perfect symmetry.
And so is the vast majority.
Someone is short-sighted, someone has a stylized figure without the proper curves, and someone is overweight.
The stylist must know how to optically soften wide shoulders, lengthen a neck or recreate the necessary curves
They have given us certain tricks on how to make the body of women of the type of Jennifer Lopez stand out, with huge breasts and hips but narrow waist and at the same time not dress her in a too challenging way
If, for example, the difference between the waist and the hips is so much that the skirt or pants do not fit, it is worth having at least an extra piece of fabric sewn to measure.
They certainly won’t regret it, because the clothes you feel perfectly are priceless.
With a tailored skirt you will feel much better than with one that does not stop moving, get up, dance at the waist, etc.
The stylized body can be allowed to wear clothes with folds, ornaments, embroidery or draping.
There are certainly many different types of information and bodies, so I am happy that I have the whole week to put all this information in my head.
And even so, I fear that with the task assigned, I already have more than enough.
Each participant in the course has been assigned two celebrities, who will have to design two changing rooms: one for the day and one for the night.
It is necessary to take into account the current appearance, the fashion style that suits the person in question.
I got to "dress" Miranda Kerr, maybe you know her from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
I scream inside, for me it is much better than, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who lately will have gained a hundred kilos (please take into account the exaggeration), or the very young Selena Gomez.
The dresses we have to cut them from magazines or look for them on the internet and print them, and then elaborate them graphically.
The moodboard, which is what the complete result is called, also expresses our personal style and our relationship with graphic design.
It is also important to think about the graphic part of the styling.
The stylist, therefore, does not only dress physically, but also deals, for example, with product pages in magazines (of specific topics, such as trends, bags, coats, etc.).
The stylist and designer Mario Kamen<0xC3><0xAD>k told us about it.
But all that is left for Sunday.
The stylist must have a global vision.
The three invited specialists animated the conference on Saturday with information on all types of bodies.
Stylist Honza Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Ren<0xC4><0x8D>.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to take advantage of this.
And a good stylist knows how to work with the same garment in different ways.
The variability is, in this case, fundamental.
Thus, the trench coat can be dressed to the classic with jeans and t-shirt, but it also serves to dress the naked body with high heels and photograph it as if it were actually a dress.
Or simply roll it up and raise your neck to get a totally different image.
“Play with it,” he insisted.
What I value most is the following advice: "To start working, you need to know all the rules first."
"Then you can break them," Jakub said.
At last it is clear to me why we memorize all these formulas, what is combined with what, why, if it turns out that in fashion magazines we find different results.
Not to mention the parades.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know that a stylist has to have more types of clothing in reserve than he intends to photograph.
So, for a fashion story that has ten pages (therefore, ten outfits), you have to have prepared, ready to use, at least fifteen.
And in addition to the photos the clothes work in combination with other clothes, all of them different from those used in reality.
All this must be taken into account when designing the outfit.
Honza Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD> assured us that image and style alone are, in many cases, half the success.
Just look at Madonna, who is not exactly an extraordinary singer, but the image and the marketing have made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, at the moment, there is not yet a clear tendency to use the services of stylists.
Even famous people find it useless (my skills are enough, my physical appearance is not so important).
And when someone asks us for our services, we must bear in mind that it is very likely that they will indicate a size very different from their actual (smaller) size.
Then it remains only to gugle and find out if the magazines of the heart have already written on the subject, if a certain celebrity has fattened / thinned, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario insisted that the stylist is not enough to orient himself in fashion, but has to understand the outfit.
During your work, you should especially communicate with the people you saw, so it is essential to be a good psychologist.
He knows how to value people, he doesn’t miss them, he defends their opinions.
"When a director hires you to classify her wardrobe and complete it with nice clothes, you can't take and throw away everything that was there and say, 'There's so much horror.'"
“Find at least a couple of things that you can weigh and recommend for someone to wear,” says Mario.
He himself also showed us that everything should fit in the so-called "placovka", that is, the work bag.
This is fixed around the waist and you have all the necessary tools there.
They are objects such as scissors, hair removers, or must-haves. There is also nylon thread (which serves the stylist during the photo shoot of products such as bags or hats), special clothes hook tweezers on the front, if this was older (pins and other types of hooks are not allowed, as they could damage the fabric), or a sewing set.
In order not to stay in passive listening and put something into practice, we have learned to cover the soles of the shoes.
Even during photo shoots in the studio, on a flat surface, you could damage the sole and much more the outside.
And we did nothing but coat and coat.
We could not touch the shoes with the scissors so as not to damage them by accident.
So you had to be very skilled.
Mario has given me a joy in praising my work unreservedly.
The truth is, I'm not very good at those skills.
This is just a small part of everything we have heard throughout the weekend, in the second part of the course.
I have already realized that dedicating myself to styling at a professional level is not a rosy road, but I do not care exactly what people say.
Need for Speed: The Run is set in America.
Review
A trip, in principle carefree, is complicated by a series of oversights improper of a routine trip during the morning shift.
To some extent it was possible to meet expectations, but this is of no use, if, in fact, it was not intended to do anything extraordinary.
The new installment, to which the title is added The Run, raised great expectations already before its premiere.
He promised that he would give new airs to the old racing saga Need for Speed and, in the wake of what is shown, it appears as a game that should not end up being again an action genre without more.
We were also curious to know what the inserted scenes would look like, where the main character gets out of the car and walks on his own foot.
As is often the case in the NFS series, the results do not vary much from what we expected.
There are races that can be considered acceptable, but in the total count points are lost because of absurd failures, which have already been appearing in the series for years.
In reality they cannot even be called errors, but rather it is the incomprehensible reluctance of the programmers.
The adventure begins very well.
It introduces you to a story, whose protagonist, Jack, has certain personal problems; to solve them, he is offered to participate in an illegal race throughout America.
You sit behind the wheel on the west coast, in San Francisco, and your mission is to get to New York first.
The idea is to offer something interesting.
The route is divided into ten stages and then into more than fifty races.
It follows that each race takes place by a different route and the stages are located in different environments, which are quite diverse and interesting.
Thus, one does not even remotely have the feeling that the game always offers the same thing.
Some of the environments are even pleasing to the eye, although the technical level of the graphic is equivalent to that of previous installments of the series.
Therefore, it is nothing of the other world.
But the walk through the desert, the autumn landscape or the high snow-capped mountains produce a very pleasant visual effect.
In addition, the races are diversified from time to time by an atypical element.
Thus, for example, in the desert you find a sandstorm that diminishes visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains you have to be careful not to bury an avalanche.
According to that, each of the races is very well developed.
There are only a couple of models, but that’s enough.
For a moment, you try to overtake a required number of rivals (normal in a classic race), then you try to gain time (timed classic duel) and then a duel awaits you against a single opponent.
In the middle of all this sometimes appears the police, which only makes things even more difficult.
The novelty is the landscapes outside the car.
Interactive animations are presented when Jack, in most cases, has to escape from someone and you have to help him, always pressing the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
Surprisingly, though, there are far fewer landscapes in the game than you’d expect (specifically there are only three).
But the end result is positive, because this element does not become annoying and, in the context already mentioned, is one of the elements that make the game more interesting.
The driving model follows in the footsteps of previous episodes.
That means that today it is no longer a big deal, but it cannot be said to be bad.
If you are looking for a realistic simulation, you can look elsewhere.
But a race conceived with enough action is quite suitable for this style of driving, although we can find something better among the games of the competition.
So far, all in order.
But problems arise after a certain time.
Unlike the correct driving models, it is no longer the same with collisions.
Games of this type can not be expected to recreate deformations and complicated collisions, but in fact before a hit against any object, you can not predict how your car will react, with which everything is not in order.
It is typical that, when making a very tight overtaking or circulating the car with normal traffic, there are only slight frictions, but in other almost identical situations, your car ends up making uncontrolled pirouettes.
Or even completely destroyed.
Thanks to the reset system, no big problems arise, but it can put you in a bad mood.
Resets are scheduled in such a way that when you crash or get off the track, the game returns you to the last rescue point on the track.
However, in each race only five resets are available.
If you consume them all, you have to restart the race from the beginning.
So it is nothing more than a help in case something goes wrong, but it is not very reliable.
Sometimes, even the reset does not help, it only helps to learn the given stage by memory.
A big disadvantage of the game is that the same facts are repeated in different places.
In some curves, for example, you have to enter in a specific way; otherwise, they are impossible to take.
Other times you find yourself somewhere "civilian" vehicles always with the same configuration, even if you are the first, fifth or arrive five minutes before or after.
This makes it rabid especially in situations, when you see that two cars that go to meet in opposite directions, your opponent advances without problems, but when you arrive, you must turn or brake.
It doesn’t matter when you arrive, because it’s programmed because the “surprise” will always happen right under your noses.
Opponents also have an advantage.
Throughout the game you will reach places where, regardless of the moment, you will always be advanced by the same opponent in the same place.
In addition, this happens at the end of the game, on a long bridge, which is even more shocking.
Your opponent must arrive before you, whatever the cost.
When it goes in front of you, it makes it difficult for you to see the cars coming from the front, so at first you can muck up the car.
You can understand the idea of creating a game with maximum doses of suspense and adrenaline, but the execution is so apparent that it will surely disappoint you right away.
And it's a shame, because although the model of the trip is simple, the game is fun and action, so it is often not possible to follow in detail what happens or where.
And it really doesn’t matter, whether the merit takes the idea with fifty exclusive tracks or qualifying in the race so it doesn’t fit boredom, or anything else.
An unusual idea is changing cars during races.
You have to be attentive to the gas pumps next to the road, because just there you have to change cars, although in the vast majority of cases you will be enough what you have.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are suitable for urban areas, strong American cars for straight highways and exotic supercars for technical driving, for example, on curved mountain roads.
In addition main narrative thread also appears a thread of parallel challenges, that is, there are races in specific places that you will know by the stories.
Here you will get not only medals, but also experience points for your profile, which serves both for challenges and stories.
Upon reaching the top level, the driver is opened several possibilities, starting with the car and ending with funds for the profile.
At the same time, there is an online Autolog feature, which compares your results with those of other players and provides other community features.
One of the most difficult elements to understand is how the last race in history is made.
With the car you get to the subway tunnel (pass), where you start to run in the dark on the tracks (pass).
The speedometer marks you between 150 and 200 km / h (pass) and, suddenly, from behind you arrives the convoy of the metro and takes you ahead without more.
In the newsroom we will surely have a discussion about this for several days, about whether during the programming of the game none thought even a little or if the authors really take us for a bunch of fools.
The technical part of the game is nothing extraordinary, but at least the general visual effects result in most cases pleasant, sometimes even superb.
Well, it is a pity that, in the most tense moments, the image quality is reduced and, sometimes, in a serious way.
This especially affects accidents where many participants are involved, when continuous image quality is no longer valid.
The audio is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In order to please most of the youth group, the soundtrack belongs to the category "each of his father and mother", but it can be assumed that no one would buy the game just for its music.
Need for Speed: The Run is the first game in the Need for Speed series.
If the game avoided absolutely silly mistakes, we would have trouble claiming that The Run is the best NFS game of the last few years.
It feels like the game is not over.
The fun is guaranteed, but be prepared because mistakes will hit you in the eyes with the strength of an airport reflector.

The Ambassador to the EU, Vicenová:
The Czechs have a reputation as negative and Eurosceptic.
"The Lisbon Treaty has significantly affected the balance between individual institutions"
“I didn’t expect an all-out war to be mounted.”
“It will take five, six years, before the situation stabilizes a bit, calms down and the new players get used to their new roles,” Czech Ambassador to the EU Milena Vicenová began her lecture at the Faculty of Law with conviction.
How can he not take seriously his slogan "clearly and openly about Europe", which he said already in the first part of his conference, when he managed to describe each EU body and its relations with such precision and clarity, as it would be the envy of many lecturers at the U. Carolina Law School.
Vicenová also weighed in on the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy:
"The first thing that comes up is the criticism, that if he's bland, a grey official, able to take on any role, but I have to say he left everyone baffled, because he takes on his roles perfectly."
“He is a man who knows how to listen to the members of the 27 states, how to communicate with them and who has a very clear vision of where the EU should go.”
The new post of representative of Foreign and Security Policy is explained by the question: "Who is this EU? What number can I call it?" It is therefore an important step towards the unification and clarification of the political union in the face of States such as China or India.
No one wants to ban us from Olomouc cheese
Vicenová has also taken care of the follow-up, follow-up and follow-up agenda for the European Council in the near future.
The Czech presidency two years ago was a success.
The Czechs dealt with the emerging economic crisis, resolved the gas crisis and organized a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government at that time was identified as a very negative aspect, which seriously affected the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU has many commitments at the moment.
In the words of the ambassador: "a good uproar", not only the presidency, but also the financial crisis, which is being dealt with now.
On the other hand, the EU’s seven-year budget, caused by the current, much more complicated economic situation, must be approved.
If the budget is simpler and more effective, which sectors will have priority, which countries will receive more support and which will receive less? That is something that will be present on the agenda of the next meeting.
The ambassador also recalled her main slogans, with which she arrived in Europe: "About Europe with clarity".
“The truth is that I don’t like ugly abbreviations, foreign words or jargon that people don’t understand.”
"How can a citizen understand that in Brussels cucumbers are not really invented curved or round cucumbers, bananas of various sizes or that no one is going to forbid us the Olomouc cheese?"
It also aims to take more advantage of the EU environment and bring more Czech citizens closer to the European institutions.
The Europe of Speeds is waiting for us
According to the ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation as Eurosceptics and people perceive the negative aspects rather than the positive ones.
In addition, he regretted the low participation of Czechs in the European institutions.
The blame is on a multitude of factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivational messages, but also the lack of support from the Czechs.
In addition to the success of the Czech presidency, he highlighted the strength and collaboration of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me, when a Pole and a Hungarian come to me and a Slovak approaches me, a Frenchman next to me says to me: 'What, have you already stayed, those of the Visegrad Group?'
In the future, the EU, according to Vicenová, awaits tough new budgetary policy regulations for the Member States.
It is perceived as something very real of the concept of the two speeds, if not more, in Europe, more than the new "European Federation".
“We have countries in the Eurozone and countries outside the Eurozone.”
"We have the Schengen area and we also have the enhanced cooperation procedure."
“It was said for the first time that only those countries that want to cooperate and those that don’t, should stay out.”
"These procedures will become more and more and will strengthen the two-speed Europe," Vicenová is expected to say.
In this sense, he also highlighted the role of the Czech Republic and Herman van Rompuy in the application of the principle, according to which all issues affecting the whole of the EU should be discussed among member states, not only among the members of the Eurozone.
Brand story:
The innovative IBM starts its second century of existence
If someone were to look for a term that would define IBM’s strategy with great precision, the closest approximation would be “long-term.”
For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is perceived as current and yet it has been a hundred years since its foundation.
The basis for this long-term placidity was laid by the firm’s first head, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He already coined the slogan that many of the world’s problems have a solution if people are willing to think.
His motto "Think!" became his stamp, around which the life of the future giant will be built (it was also the title of an internal magazine that IBM began to publish in 1935).
Watson was also the foundation of a carefully constructed company culture.
“For us, IBM involves long-term thinking, a continuous movement toward the future.
IBM has survived and thrived for a hundred years for that reason, because it stayed true to its basic principles, but without fear of the changes around it.
This has allowed us, during our first century, to transform technology, business and society.
We look forward to further prosperity in our second century,” said Samuel J. Palmisano, the company’s current CEO, on his anniversary.
A sophisticated system
Watson, as early as the 1930s, cared for his employees as the businessman from Ba<0xC5><0xA5>a in the Czech Republic (IBM employees were among the first American workers to enjoy paid vacations, insurance, stylish uniforms and a sophisticated compensation system that rewarded the best inventors and salespeople.
The same long-term sophistication is maintained by IBM in the customer relationship.
From the beginning, the company knew how to discover talent (being one of the first global companies to end any type of discrimination, it could choose without problems).
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy is the current plan of IBM, for which Palmisano will be replaced next year by a woman: Virginia Rometty.
She has been working at IBM for 30 years, where she has been head of sales, marketing and strategy.
During the last years IBM has participated in the so-called virtual meetings, online brainstorming, from which countless future strategies and innovations arise.
It is not surprising that ideas are left over, since almost half a million people work in the firm.
An institution with a good reputation
The fixed position in the business provides the company with a strong internal and external image.
“From the beginning, IBM has maintained a concept of an institution rather than a technology company,” says Harvard Business School economist Professor Rosabeth Moss Kanter, author of the IBM book.
“IBM is not a technology company, but a company trying to solve business problems for technology users,” said George Colony of Forrester Research.
As the company itself says there is a difference between entering the business and directly creating a business.
IBM - or the "Great Green" - as it is known in the U.S. familiarly because of its logo, has in the last hundred years become one of the largest companies in the world.
It is arguably the most versatile technology company (develops both equipment and programs, infrastructure and web hosting services within a wide range of services, ranging from servers to nanotechnology).
It holds the largest number of patents of all American technology companies and five of its employees have received the Nobel Prize.
Among his inventions are the ATM, payment cards, financial swaps, bar codes and floppy disks.
This year, IBM has become the second technology firm by market capitalization (the first is Apple), when it surpassed Microsoft for the first time in 1996.
Looking to the future
Not all products and innovations have just satisfied the taste of customers and the moment (IBM did not bet on its own operating system, OS/2, Prodigy online services or IBM PCjr computers).
“If your business is based on moving forward, you can’t emotionally anchor yourself in the past,” said Samuel J. Palmisano.
That’s why IBM has no problem building its bases on other platforms (and equally, if they don’t work, abandoning them).
And this is the difference of the competition, Microsoft, which basically remains and always falls exclusively with Windows.
Technology of the future
In terms of sales, IBM is mainly dedicated to services, of which about a fifth are programs and another fifth equipment.
However, as late as 1990, equipment accounted for more than half of the supplier share.
As of 2000, IBM has sold underperforming assets worth a total of $15 billion. During the same period, it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of future technology.
Investments have continued since 2008, when the modern global financial crisis first manifested itself.
IBM acts according to the premises of its first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis of 29 increased investments.
So far, IBM seems to have weathered the crisis.
The value of IBM shares since the beginning of 2008 has grown stratospherically up to 120%, the net profit of the company has not stopped increasing.
IBM’s currency is to change everything except its value.
It can therefore be expected that when the next crisis comes, this flexible giant will endure.
IBM History: From the Cheese Slicer to Space Flight
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago, its original name being Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was adopted as early as 1924 - originally it was a brand used in branches in Canada and South America.
The foundation that gave rise to IBM stems from the merger of four companies dating back to the 1880s.
He had inventions such as the famous "token clock", which allows you to control the entry and exit of employees.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 also chaired its supervisory board.
Flint enlisted the head of a competing company, Thomas J. Watson, to help him manage the company.
The new leader eclipsed the founder of IBM (Watson’s ideas remain the firm foundation on which corporate culture and identity are built).
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as the name suggests, began with the production and sale of all kinds of business appliances, from meat and cheese cutters to cash registers.
During Watson’s first four years at the helm, revenue doubled by $9 million and the company’s large expansion across continents began.
Watson was so crucial to the company that, after nearly forty years in the boss’ chair, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his direction, IBM began work on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s IBM staff and computers helped NASA guide flights into space (to Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the famous flight to the Moon).
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first generation of computers, the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "fish", which established the standard of computers of that time, came to the market with the name of IBM 5150 in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, which, in turn, acquired the consulting part of the company Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to offer comprehensive advice and services of high added value.
The strategy that IBM has paid for these last three years is the Smarter Planet concept, that is, "a smarter planet".
Its aim is to make more rational use of technology, although the areas have not yet been planned or the circumstances improved, for example with regard to transport and city administration.
For the retail sector, IBM recently introduced the “Smart Commerce” platform that allows retailers to manage the entire business cycle.
IBM has a long history in this country.
In 1932 he opened a branch in Czechoslovakia, the first country to have it in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM <0xC4><0x8C>R also operates the strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe is in Prague. Also here is a world-renowned research team working with voice recognition.
Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta, stay with that donkey, I don't want him anymore!
Darina Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová (53) said it's over!
After her husband Josef Rychtá<0xC5><0x99> (53) had become the sole protector of Iveta Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ová (45), but also her lover, Darina was still hopeful that Josef would wake up from his pink dream and return home.
However he will no longer wait and has set clear rules for life in the future.
“Pepe can go home, but not as my partner anymore,” Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová explained.
When Darina Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová took Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ové into her home during the summer, she could not imagine how her marriage would end.
Despite the request, Iveta had not moved thirty days after <0xC5><0x98><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>any and Pepe did not abandon the singer.
He even said publicly that he loved her.
Eventually, Darina resigned herself, apparently accepting her husband’s relationship and even saying goodbye to him forever.
Rychytá<0xC5><0x99> doesn't care who his wife sleeps with.
If one day Rychtá<0xC5><0x99> broke up with Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ová, his wife would not wait for him at home with open arms.
He is the biological father of my children and if he wants to live the rest of his life in our house, no one will throw him out.”
"But here I would live no longer as my dear old donkey who was wrong, but as a man to whom certain ties bind me," Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová said, adding that she had already disengaged from her husband and insisted only on mutual respect.
Josef so far doesn't mind if his wife has locked the back door for him.
"I accept my wife's decision."
“I will be with Iveta and there is no change possible.”
“My wife established this as a marriage on paper and I respect that.”
"The company is still in force, I make the house arrangements, I take care of the garden, the home, I do the shopping."
“Darina and I talk normally, the only thing is that we don’t share a bed,” Rychtá<0xC5><0x99> said.
If Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová found a new love, he would not object.
“We don’t sleep together and I don’t care where she goes or if she has a boyfriend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take full responsibility."
Women's Worst Vices: Do They Also Refer to You?
If you ask men to be able to cite some typical vices of women, in general each of them will name them without thinking.
Dear women, do you recognize yourselves in the following lines, where certain feminine vices are cited that get men to boil their blood?
Go Shopping
Do you blame your significant other for being dependent on shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one transplant a week?
Do you like to shop often on sales?
Then in your case you can say that shopping has become a vice.
Some women realize that they should appease their passion for shopping, at least a little.
But look, what woman could resist the temptation to simply walk through the clothing stores, look for well-fitting clothes and then try them all on in the fitting room (ideally in all different colors)?
Although for most women shopping is a hobby, for men it can become practically a hell.
Just remember how many times you have already told your partner to better wait for you at the door.
The Constant Dissatisfaction
"Am I not too fat?"
"I would need to lose at least five pounds - should I start exercising?"
“Do you really like me?”
Do you not hear these phrases?
Is that so?
So she's one of those women who's obsessed with her looks.
It’s not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but many men are allergic to hearing their partner complain all the time about their physical appearance.
The stronger sex also agrees that the more the frequency of complaints increases, the more annoying women become.
Cleanliness and order in the first place
It's like an infinite merry-go-round.
Clean the windows, vacuum, scrub the floor, dust, scrub the bathtub and all that at least twice a week.
Do you blame your partner for stepping on the clean floor with a dirty foot, your children for soiling a freshly cleaned sink and a shelf with glass doors that cost you so much to clean?
In case you suffer this "deviation", try to be aware that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness should surely not be paramount in the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness could threaten your relationships and family well-being.
Making Unpleasant Comments
"Used underpants are left with dirty clothes."
"Do you want to wear those used socks tomorrow too?"
"Wet cloth is not left on the floor!"
If you make those quotes to your partner more times a day, know that you will get him out of your boxes.
Naturally, you don't want to say anything bad, you just want to get everything in order.
Perhaps, if men knew this, women, for their part, would not make so many comments.
Slander and gossip
Some women also suffer from slander, gossip, but also offenses and conspiracies against someone.
Women focus on relationships, so they like to talk together about things like who, where, with whom, how and why.
Perhaps each of us sometimes misses a small and harmless gossip.
With the hand in the heart, this is typical of almost all women.
On the other hand, there are gossipy women of those who are not controlled, who love to gossip and do so often, despise everyone and are dangerous to those around them, especially in a female work team.
Jágr and Vorá<0xC4><0x8D>ek helped with their assists to beat Philadelphia
Hockey forward Jarom<0xC3><0xAD>r Jágr took part in the NHL game on Monday with two assists that brought victory over Philadelphia 5:3 on Carolina’s court and put the Czech players back at the forefront of the competition.
In both cases Claude Giroux took advantage of the 39-year-old star’s move, and went a step further and was declared the game’s best player.
Jágr's team-mate Jakub Vorá<0xC4><0x8D>ek also won two assists in the match.
After the meeting, Jágr told reporters overseas that Giroux had predicted a big night.
"Before the game, I had already told him that I would make a triplet."
“I presented it.”
"Sometimes they look like ambushes," Jágr explained, after his performance gave Giroux a goal, following the Flyers' first run.
A little later, the second intervention of the team also had a Czech trace.
Vorá<0xC4><0x8D>ek grabbed the puck behind the Hurricanes' goal and moved it between the circles to Maxim Talbot, who scored.
One second before the first break a local player, Patrick Dwyer, was sent off, but from the beginning of the second half they already dominated the Flyers.
Specifically by Giroux.
After collaborating with Jágr he scored the third goal, after his shot slipped through the fourth of Wayne Simmonds' goal.
“I love playing with him.”
"I don't want to say he's the best player on the court, but he's definitely in the top three," Jágr said.
“It would never have occurred to me that at the end of my career I was going to play with an athlete like him.”
“I’m very satisfied with that.”
“I want to play for him.”
All these years in the NHL, my teammates played for me, and that now produces results,” Jágr adds.
Carolina still turned the game into a drama, with Tuom Ruutu’s goal and then Dwyer’s again, on penalty, coming within a goal away.
Matt Read did not allow further complications, although they ended up outnumbered two to one.
“Pronger had a good performance in our field.”
"He cleared the disc, I picked up speed and Read went the furthest part."
"I tried to hit the disc and I'm happy because I got it," described Vorá<0xC4><0x8D>ek the last goal of the match as he lived it.
With his win, Philadelphia has taken the lead in the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal, Jaroslav <0xC5><0xA0>pa<0xC4><0x8D>ek, did not play until the end of the match against Buffalo, in the second third he retired due to an upper body injury.
The Canadiens not only lost a player with a lot of defensive experience, but also by a difference of two goals, 2:3.
Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Plekanec failed to take advantage of one of the shots.
More than the points lost to the local coach lamented the large number of injured in the last row, and play the game with only five defenses.
"That's bad."
“We played the game only with one veteran player, the rest were novices.”
“There’s nothing we can do about it, we have to deal with it,” said Jacques Martin.
“So much rotating the players turned against us, we couldn’t resist it.”
“We had to simplify the game even more, take the disc out of our field.”
"And so we left gaps," explained one of the defenders, P. K. Subban.
Goalkeeper Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Pavelec contributed thirty interventions from Winnipeg in the 5:2 victory over Tampa Bay.
The Jets' goals were scored by five players, ending a five-game losing streak.
How Travel Prices Have Evolved Since 1989
Until 1989 there were in Czechoslovakia at that time only five authorized state travel agencies: <0xC4><0x8C>edok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
The travel agencies of that time sold in most cases trips only to the socialist bloc, since trips to the West were very restricted.
Czech tourists therefore went on holiday to the beaches of the GDR (German Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union (Sochi in Crimea on the Black Sea) to Bulgaria and Romania (both on the Black Sea) and to Hungary (Balaton).
A positive exception was the period between 1962 and 1972, when you could travel to Yugoslavia, however, after the Yugoslav regime leaned westward and the trips of Czech tourists were then quite restricted.
A great paradox of socialism was the fact that citizens of the socialist bloc (that is, also Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel freely and individually even through socialist countries.
If a citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter, otherwise individual travel was not possible.
Travel agencies in those days also offered trips to the West, but one had to queue up with a sleeping bag and spend the night like this, or have "good acquaintances" in the agency.
But not everything was won.
The so-called "promise of change" that was the condition for travel to the West, was not granted to the "politically unreliable people", who thus could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency and, without a guarantee of exchange, it was not possible to obtain the resources (the Western currency) to travel to the West.
The vast majority of Czechs spent their holidays in their own country, so there were a large number of cottages and summer houses, which the Czechs acquired. This custom still persists.
The Czech way of travelling has undergone a real revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 for us it was no longer going to spend holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria, last year the Czechs made 4.5 million holiday trips to countries around the world.
It is a great paradox, of which we are no longer aware, that the currently favourite destination, Croatia, could not travel freely until 1989, because it was part of Yugoslavia at the time.
In the early 1990s, visa-free travel to neighbouring Western European states was imposed, prompting a huge wave of short-term visits, especially to Vienna or Germany.
Czechoslovaks, for a long time, were not fed up with excursions to the West, everyone wanted to see it at least for a moment.
For example, in Paris groups of Czechs slept in the parks in tents, since our income at that time did not allow us to pay for a hotel or pension.
A typical feature of the Czechs of that time was to take food (canned goods, sausages, etc.) with them to save money.
Another important moment was the introduction of the convertibility of the Czech crown, so that our tourists could finally, after decades, freely buy Western currency.
Our standard of living was rising and with it also the average wages, which around 1997 caused an increase in the demand for travel.
With the increase in demand for travel agencies began, from 1997 regularly, to prepare trips using charter flight connections, which made travel prices incredibly lower compared to the past, thanks to the possibility of obtaining discounts for passenger volume.
At the end of the 90s of the last century, Czechs already traveled visa-free to almost all developed countries except the USA, which further simplified our trips.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary tourism happened already in 2000, when the first direct flight from the Czech Republic to an exotic country was organized, thanks to a huge demand, and went to Thailand.
Since that year, direct charter flights with Czech tourists to distant and hot countries leave every year. This winter will be flown directly from Czechia to 12 exotic destinations.
Exotic countries are currently visited by about 100,000 Czechs a year.
Another interesting moment of this era, symbolizing our post-revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the U.S. eliminated visas for Czech tourists, making our country among the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008 the Czechs, for the first time in their history, have spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, have spent more than 15 thousand Czech crowns per head on trips abroad, including expenses at the place of stay.
Convened Ordinary General Assembly to elect the president, which could end again in stalemate.
Czech football has been without a president for almost five months and it is likely that Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek’s successor as President of the Czech Football Federation (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R) will not be known even after the call of the next Extraordinary General Assembly that will take place this Thursday in Nymburk.
In fact, no agreement has yet been reached on the voting rules to be followed.
Without them, you will not be able to vote even to choose between the three candidates.
Those interested in presiding over Czech football are Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k.
Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek resigned his position in June, not before summoning his colleagues for the purpose of finding a strong person who could take care of football in the future.
However, after the end of the Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek era, a controversy broke out between the two federations of the association unable to reach an agreement to choose a common candidate.
This was evident on September 16 when the new president had to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly met in vain in the National House (Národn<0xC3><0xAD> d<0xC5><0xAF>m), located in the Prague neighborhood of Sm<0xC3><0xAD>chov, because the talks had been blocked and not only as to the method of election.
No consensus was reached as to who in the General Assembly was entitled to vote - only legal representatives or also delegates with full powers.
From that moment and because of this single point, a partial agreement was reached, also supported by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, according to which representation by full powers is not possible.
However, disputes over the electoral code remain open.
More light on the situation could no longer throw even the Executive Committee that, in its meetings, ordinary or extraordinary, basically did not solve anything.
The opinion on the possibility of voting has changed a couple of times already, but the nerve point remains the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the third round to avoid the deadlock?
“The dispute revolves around whether to proceed according to the statutes or find another model,” says Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Svoboda, one of the three FA<0xC4><0x8C>R vice-presidents, who, from the association’s management, represents professional football.
According to the model proposed in the statutes, in the third round the candidate who has the highest percentage of support in the federation to which he will present his candidacy will win.
The Moravian Region is ready to reach a compromise so that it can win that candidate with a higher percentage of total votes in both federations.
The Bohemian side, however, imposes the condition that the winner, according to these percentage calculations, must have a majority of at least two-thirds.
"This would take away, however, the meaning of the previous two rounds and completely deny the concept of the bicameral system," is how Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian party, according to which it would be best not to touch the order and vote according to the applicable statutes.
Surprisingly, Toma<0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k also agrees, although it is assumed that the electoral rules established by the statutes of all the candidates are more suited to Pelta.
"I would like to see the maximum vote according to the statutes."
"So that no nonsense is invented about representatives as in the last General Assembly," says the owner of Victoria Plzen, who is running for the first time as a candidate and who directs his remarks mainly against Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him, Nymburk will decide on the new president and he believes that the candidates in the future will cooperate constructively.
“All passions will be appeased with today’s match of our national team at the European Championship.
"Football will once again be the protagonist, and this way we will cooperate more at ease," says the representative of Jablonice, which of the three candidates has more experience in football management, both at a professional and regional level.
Rajchl is the most reticent.
"I hope that an agreement will be reached, but unfortunately the situation is much more complicated."
“It’s not about the conflict between Bohemians and Moravians, but there are attempts to adjust the rules to their own convenience.”
“This may result in a new blockade of the General Assembly.”
“Anyway, I hope common sense will prevail,” Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for all parties to reach an agreement.
Some negotiations had to be held in Montenegro, but who can know until the match starts whether the football team will be complete?
The special plane, in which they had to travel to Podgorica, among others Vice Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, has not left this morning due to technical problems in Prague, having to look for an alternative to transport part of the executive committee to the place where the qualifying match will take place.
Perhaps the decisive meeting, finally, could be the one that will take place at ministerial level, which, they say, will be held this Wednesday.
Josef Dobe<0xC5><0xA1>, Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, would very much like to incorporate the divided parties into the most powerful sports organization in the country to reach an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: state subsidies, the credibility of football and also the upcoming General Assembly of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Sport Federation (<0xC4><0x8C>STV) which will try to provide a new direction to Czech sport after the financial problems of the Sazka lottery house.
Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k will fight for the presidency, because he does not find a more suitable candidate.
If the head of the Pilsen players, Toma<0xC5><0xA1> Paclik, knew before the extraordinary General Assembly the name of a suitable candidate who would satisfy all his ideas about the new president of the Czech Football Federation (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R), he would not even stand as a candidate for such a relevant position.
“If there was a right person, I would be fighting for her and not run as an election candidate.”
"But to this day we have not been able to find such a person," Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k told the Czech News Agency (<0xC4><0x8C>TK).
What motivates Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k to enter the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl is exactly the possibility of blocking Pelta, the supposed winner of the elections, which opens the way to the presidency of the Czech Football Federation (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R).
Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k also points out that, if he wins, he would remain in the position of president only until 2013, when the turn of the ordinary general assembly would arrive.
In that position he would like to see an expert and good manager who is not too much related to football events.
“I’ve already talked to some people that I might consider.”
“For me it was crazy to hear some say that at this moment they don’t even want to identify with Czech football.”
“I would like to change that view,” he adds.
What supposedly bothers Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k most at the moment is Pelta’s relationship with Pilsen Regional Football Association President Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial past, known outside the world as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the voting of delegates in the general assembly.
For Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k it is so unacceptable to see Pelta sitting in the presidential chair.
“In case he wins, the current status would be maintained and nothing in football will change.”
"With the support of Berbra, an ambitious businessman, football will benefit even less," Paclik said.
He also mentions the fact that a few years ago Pelta’s name was associated with a wiretap during the investigation of a corruption case, from which Pelta went unpunished.
"I don't know what prestige football could bring Pelta's victory."
"And with what eyes UEFA and FIFA will look at us," said Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, who also takes some caution in his previous statement that he would "sell Club Pilsen if Pelta becomes president."
In the event of winning Thursday’s election, Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k could consider cooperating with Pelta in the future.
In the same vein is the other candidate, Rajchl, who has been supported by Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k before the September General Assembly that ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I would follow."
"He's very capable."
“I could imagine him, for example, as head of representation.”
"but not as a manager of an association."
"I also don't stick my nose where I don't feel capable," added Paclik, who in September attracted much attention for supporting the suspension of the Referees Commission chaired by Ludek Macel, later replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k admits that he would dare to manage the association.
He uses his management skills in private companies, since last summer he was also the Director of Pilsen, which with his support celebrated the victory in the first division in May.
“I have the strength to change some things in the field of football and contribute to its safe practice.”
"To reduce the influence of some pressure groups, which probably tend to influence the decisions of the disciplinary and appeal committee, producing unpleasant situations, Paclik said without hiding his antipathies towards Sparta chairman Daniel K<0xC5><0x99>et<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
One of the priorities would also be to consolidate the relationship between FA<0xC4><0x8C>R and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which it put pressure on political leaders to allocate more money to the sport of lottery taxes.
“It’s one of the key issues that the new president should be devoting himself to.”
“If they were to raise taxes on gambling, as the political parties are advertising, I would support their arguments, but frankly, they have to tell us where all this money is going,” he said.
In addition, Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k now does not even take into account his association with the Pilsner Club, although he himself claims that the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R President must be "non-partisan".
Pelta is in turn associated with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla of Prague.
"It's not ideal."
“But I don’t see the point of hypocritically giving my stock in the Pilsen Club to someone else and then going back there after a year and a half,” Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k said.
Pelta promised FA<0xC4><0x8C>R new statutes that would end the deadlock in the elections.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association one of the presidential candidates, Miroslav Pelt, promised that, if elected, he would guarantee that the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R would have new statutes that would serve definitively to solve, in the future, the controversies regarding the electoral regulations.
The representative of Jablonec is optimistic about Thursday's meeting in Nymburk, and believes that the pre-election conflict could move towards a solution today with the possible victory of the football team.
Even before the elections not held in September, Pelta promised to focus, if elected, precisely on representation and fundraising.
He decided to participate at the last minute in the last general assembly, so this two-month postponement could go well for him to defend and present, in a broader context, his ideas on the management of football.
"People at all levels have been involved in football for a long time and are looking forward to meeting the new president on Thursday."
“They feel it’s time for someone to run the association,” thinks the man who is primarily associated with the Jablonice Club, but who worked at Sparta and on the association’s executive committee.
For this reason, he believes he has enough experience to manage Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the elections is the euphoria that reigned in the time of Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
"Unfortunately, at the General Assembly in June, the statutes were approved that were not as perfect as everyone thought."
“If we exclude certain interpretations, we have a president since September,” Pelta said.
Exactly the readjustment of the Civic Association’s most important document was used as a decoy to win over the delegates.
“If I am elected president, I will take it as a personal challenge and I am willing to respond in case this fails.”
“It’s a matter of principles, without which we can’t exist,” Pelta says.
Also, in theory, try not to mess with your opponents.
Already in the past he had warned that he saw himself collaborating with Henry Rajchl, whom he respected for his training in Law, being aware that his opponent would also be his first vice-president.
It had been a long time since I had attacked Thomas Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k who, unlike Pelta, did not leave a puppet with a head.
“He’s been in the world of football for more than a year, and he’s already achieved some successes.”
“Their attacks but they were embarrassing and a lot of people were surprised by the election campaign.”
"That's why many of them doubt their true character," Pelta told his opponent, who remains faithful to the statements announced as early as September.
His most powerful weapon is, according to him, his knowledge of football, from the lowest to the highest competitions.
The latter should be a showcase for promoting football.
"Also, I would try to solve all the scandals that arose because of the Bohemians as a result of last year's corruption scandal."
"Immediately afterwards I would get involved in negotiations with the public and private sector, to ensure that there is enough money for all football," the 46-year-old candidate told <0xC4><0x8C>TK two months ago.
He then also promised that his appointment as president of football would not entail any personal changes to the squad.
"I would have to know the tasks of each employee first," he said, referring to Strahov where, after a long period of anarchy, understandable nervousness reigns.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that are predicted before the next general assembly, he believes that the delegates will not travel in vain this Thursday to Nymburk.
“If the only point of disagreement will be how to vote in the third round, we will certainly manage to overcome it.
"Football needs credibility, which will recover only if it finally has a leader", still two days before the most decisive day in his career as a representative, Pelta remains optimistic.
Rajchl promises, that under his leadership, the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R would start working with eagerness.
If the current vice-president Jindrich Rajchl is elected as the new president of the Czech Football Association at the fourth General Assembly, many people would surely be resentful.
Rajchl promises that, should he be elected, he would work hard.
He wants to implement systematic change and make the members of the executive committee responsible for each area of football individually.
He is also committed to resolving the Bohemians’ case, improving relations with UEFA and FIFA, getting more money for football and continuing the work started by former president Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
“As president, I would like to dedicate myself entirely to football.”
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to the national team, from professional football to the training of young high-performance footballers."
"By this I don't mean that I would do it all alone," Rajchl said in an interview for <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
“I am a team player and I want to divide the powers of the executive committee in such a way that each member can focus on a specific area.”
“And I will assign difficult tasks so that football can, in each of those segments, move forward with a lot of momentum.”
"A lot of people probably won't like this, because it will mean starting to work really hard and not just criticise the work of others."
Due to the critical atmosphere in the football movement, he is said to have considered not running again as a candidate.
"Everybody knows, I work 20 hours a day."
“But I need to know that this will make sense and that there will be no people behind me who will stop me and hinder me at every turn,” he said.
“A lot of people have told me that I shouldn’t give up, because then others would give up too.”
“It’s about having faith so as not to abandon like that, without more,” he said.
It also motivates him to continue the work he started with Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
“During those two years, a lot of the work was done that I don’t want to be lost now.”
“There are processes that had been started that will have their effect in a couple of years and I would not like anyone to stop them,” he announced concerned that, if they chose the other candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the association could return to the way it was before the time of Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
“I believe in order, and it’s something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is not able to maintain.
"Behind him is above all those people who would take care of football so that it was only a privilege for a select few."
“I can be blamed for a lot of things, but not the fact that I’m in favor of someone.”
“I try to be objective.”
“I want to make football for everyone, because that’s the only way everyone will feel good and not just the chosen ones,” Rajchl said.
He also rejects the idea that only the president would be a bohemian.
"Although some people try to assert the contrary, I have in mind to do my utmost for Moravia."
“For example, it’s time to think about dividing the second division into a Czech part and another Moravian part, the winners of which would go to the first division.”
“There wouldn’t be the current situation where we have only three Moravian teams, which is a problem for young Moravian players,” Rajchl said.
Although Toma<0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, president of the Pilsner Club, joined the fight for the presidential election, Rajchl does not stop believing in his chances of being elected.
“I still feel strong support from the Czech Federation, which elected me as its vice president and which knows that there are clear successes behind me,” said Rajchl, whose successes include saving a few tens of millions of kroner from disadvantageous contracts, televised contract negotiations and negotiations over lottery law.
On the other hand, he acknowledges his part of the fault that the federation is not united.
And while he proclaims that Pelta is "disqualified to regain confidence in Czech football", he considers the other rival, Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, as a strong candidate who does have something to offer football.
“No one can deny that he did a great job for Pilsen that year.”
"In the event that he is elected, he will probably follow what Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek has already started and would not significantly change the staffing of the committees."
“I don’t want to use that to my advantage,” Rajchl said.
The most beautiful pools in Europe
Jumping to the blue
by Julia Stanek
Pools from an incredible perspective, sumptuous baths in Budapest: Anyone who visits Europe can experience its blue wonder, and, after a visit to the city or a walk, rest your tired legs in bubbly baths.
A book shows where the best well-being is found in the water.
When Iris Meder took a research trip over the past year and a half, there was something she couldn’t miss in her luggage, a swimsuit.
Lying on her back on the water, she gazed at the artistic dome above, swam towards the marble angels, who awaited her at the edge of the pool and marveled at the meticulously restored modernist indoor pool.
He liked the bathroom, taking note in his notebook at the time of all the interesting details about the style and history of the building.
Architectural historian Meder explored more than 200 pools in this way and presents them in her recent book "Badefreuden": the indoor pools in Munich, the historic bath palaces in the Black Forest, the "concrete constructions" in Taunus.
In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, he visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia respectively.
This 46-year-old German is a true bathing culture enthusiast.
He doesn’t want anything to do with the sport, Meder says, only the water is different.
It only annoys him that bathers have to settle for blue tiles and chlorine stench, while joggers can breathe in the mesmerizing smell of fir forests or listen to the cheerful chirping of birds in the park.
“One day I wondered why swimming pools always have to be so ugly,” says this Vienna resident.
"I started collecting beautiful pools."
The surface of the water doubles the architecture.
The splash in the pool and the ethereal oils of the sauna. The wellness factor in the pools is so great because all the senses are catered for, according to Meder.
And if the builder makes an effort, indoor pools can be a real treat for the eye: "Instead of soil, in the bathrooms you have a surface of water."
"On the one hand it is transparent, on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything bends optically: the high vaults, the colored tiles, the trampolines.
The book with photographs in small format "Badefreuden" provides in 190 pages very interesting data on the architecture and history of art in the historical oases of well-being, but, mainly, it makes you want to jump to the blue.
Meder, the pool collector, discovers the outstanding specimens in her research in Hungary.
Along with magnificent medicinal baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi Bath in Budapest, the nitrate waters are located in a unique karst cavity (baths in cavities in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as thermal baths, whose pools are alkaline water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálf<0xC3><0xBC>rd<0xC3><0xB6> in Jászberény).
Many outdoor pools in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: While the whole city gazes at Zurich’s indoor pool, you can look at Arlberb, covered in snow, from the outdoor pool of a bath in St. Anton, and: In the Turkish bath there is a window from which you can observe the practice on the ski slopes.
Perhaps the most extraordinary design awaits customers in L<0xC3><0xA4>ngenfeld: <0xC3><0x96>tztal’s water cathedral looks like a UFO that has just landed in the Alps.
From three open springs steam rises in winter, while in the background the mountains of <0xC3><0x96>tztal rise in the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Meder, the pool collector, didn’t get the chlorine smell in every pool.
Many thermal baths smell of sulfur, in the <0xC3><0x81>rpád baths in Békescsaba, Hungary, the diesel plague is so strong that people believe they have reached a toilet.
The smell comes from the medicinal waters that contain bicarbonate and alkali and whose legume sticks to the skin when entering the pool, a enjoyment of well-being in a special way.
Iris Meder was also disappointed in one place in her search for nice places to bathe, when she wanted to visit open-air swimming pools and sunbathing in the Czech bath of Luhatschowitz, she found a blocked ground.
The 1902 bathroom of architect Duan Jurkovic was closed.
When Meder looked through the crumbling windows of the red, white and yellow modernist building, he saw the weeds growing between the tiles.
The decadence was counteracted by a lovely pool in the Black Forest: the Thermal Palace in Bad Wildbald.
These baths have three phases of construction behind them; not only neo-Romanesque elements from the time of their construction in 1844 can be discovered, but also an Arab hall in the Alhambra style, added in 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the Thermal Palace is the favorite bath of the collector of swimming pools, Iris Meder, and not only because it is natural of the Black Forest.
“It has a lot of merit to merge different architectural styles into such a fantastic unit,” says Meder.
In such a palace the immersion in the thermal pool apparently does not have much importance.
Agrarian speculation
Deutsche Bank analyzes the business of raw materials
by Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank give up its business with agricultural raw materials?
According to information from SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to check the consequences of speculation for the world’s poor.
In January, the head of the consortium wants to show the consequences.
Hamburg,
For citizens, the issue is clear, according to a study, 84 percent of Germans do not think it acceptable for banks to speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn.
Two-thirds of respondents say Deutsche Bank and other lenders are pulling out of the business because it intensifies the problems of the world’s poorest.
This is the result of a survey commissioned by the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report submitted to Foodwatch in mid-October.
Author Harald Schumann shows that betting on global commodity exchanges drives up prices, and banks bear responsibility for the global hunger problem.
The campaign specifically targets Josef Ackermann, director of Deutsche Bank, although big banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, bets on commodities were thought to protect traders from price swings.
Leading experts agree that the players have decoupled from the offers and demands, and profit from the costs of the poorest.
Ackermann reacted to the criticism differently than U.S. competitors: He promised to review the claims and said no business "deserves to compromise Deutsche Bank's good reputation."
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is reviewing the claims of the Foodwatch report.
The analysis should be completed by the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the board of Deutsche Bank, along with the recommendation of how to handle the matter.
At the end of January, the management of the bank will report the consequences.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the business of raw materials, or even their total abandonment.
Ackermann tries to fix his image.
Thilo Bode, founder of Foodwatch, welcomed the news, but reaffirmed his criticism of the financial sector: “The bets on rising food prices show in an especially drastic way how the ruthless banks are currently harming the public welfare.”
Ackermann ranks as the biggest banking lobbyist, especially in bonds.
“Deutsche Bank must cancel all investments in its portfolio in which it stakes money for food price bets,” Bode said.
“It doesn’t matter if Ackermann is on the subject of starving people or the fame of Deutsche Bank.”
Ackermann’s inspection is surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the consortium head wants to offer a perfect image a few months before leaving his post.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank published that the chairman of the board of directors will change something different than what was not planned on the board of directors.
With the abandonment of the controversial agrarian speculation he can perfect his image.
And he needs to care as little as possible about possible losses, that's what his successor will take care of.
Two-thirds would cancel investment in raw materials
Foodwatch strives to keep the pressure on the manager high.
So far, more than 30,000 netizens have participated in the organization’s campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Forsa Institute had asked 1,001 people on Nov. 7 and 8.
Only 10 percent considered it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments in food prices.
Many of the bank’s clients showed personal consequences when they discovered that their bank was involved in such businesses: according to the survey, two-thirds would cancel all investments from which money comes out of agricultural speculation.
43% would advise against such a bank to their acquaintances, 49% would ask, after reflection, cancel their account and switch to another institute.
The 21st house in Vienna
The flag moved
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with ups and downs and a happy ending, the pavilion of the 1958 Austrian Universal Exhibition in Brussels won awards, was in Vienna for a museum, left empty and crumbled.
Now it reopens as an exhibition house.
Modern post-Gerra architecture is passionate, clear forms, glass halls, bold curves and new building materials, typical of the thought about technical progress, for which, the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels universal exhibition is a suitable and well-known example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion then won the Architecture Grand Prix for its lightweight, floating steel and glass construction.
The construction is considered to date a contemporary landmark of architecture.
He made the architect so well-known that he also built the Austrian pavilion at the following universal exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder tower for MBW plus the flattened adjacent building in Munich, it became internationally known.
Its pavilion, designed as a temporary construction for exhibitions was erected after the universal exhibition in the Schweizer Garten next to the south station of Vienna, was renovated in 1962 and inside a 20th century museum was inaugurated, it was called the "20th house".
The building was adequate but lacked the right spaces and technology for a museum; without any wall to hang art, nor a good atmosphere.
Despite this it was used until contemporary art in Vienna had a new home.
The building has been empty since 2001 and decays more and more.
Currently, the architect Adolf Krischanitz renovated the pavilion, now calls it "house 21" and will be used in the future as a museum of contemporary art.
On Tuesday afternoon the belvedere museum, to which the house belongs, was inaugurated, with the first exhibition, a stroke of luck in a way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new director of the Austrian belvedere gallery since 2007, has made a fresh start.
Husslein-Arco, a doctor of art history with a considerable career, among other things, figure skating in her youth, later in Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and founding director of the Salzburg Museum of Modern Art, carried out the reforms at the insistence of politicians and protectors of the monuments, provided public funds and private sponsors and established their use.
With the exception of contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba of the homonymous foundation are exhibited, there should be a cafeteria and a bookstore and also an office building is built.
Strict control, low budget
Krischanitz was the best choice to do it.
Not only because he significantly reformed the secession of Joseph Olbrichs in Vienna, he expanded it and was awarded the competition, but because he studied with Schwanzwer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was for him an "important and immense place", in which he contemplated "almost every weekend" the exhibitions.
He knew the project and the problem of the building, which disappeared with its transfer to Vienna in its change of use with generosity and ease.
In the current renovations there are big problems, the building was "an energy eater," Krischanitz said.
The profile of the windows of the glass facade was changed, an insulating glass reinforced with fiberglass was installed and the glass roof was replaced by a special safety glass.
The thermal bridges and steel beams were reinforced or replaced and the asbestos roofs were rehabilitated.
Two basements were used for the new use, a light panel lowered between the house and the street provides lighting, a bridge serves to enter the almost new building, but still the Schwanzer pavilion.
The original exterior doors remain, the house is painted in antique mahogany tones and protected against oxidation.
And the movie theater is exactly as it was before.
And all this with strict control by the office of monuments and a low budget.
“I often had to find material that was good, cheap and also liked by the monument protection office,” says Krischanitz and warns of a rough floor in the basement.
Despite all the pressures, problems and renovations, the building remains flexible and light.
The "Brussels wine" pavilion has been difficult, Krischanitz said recently, a typical "casual appearance in the history of the city".
Such an architecture is “always in the wrong place” and that is why I wanted to “awaken the right consciousness.”
In this case the house 21 is not in the wrong place, it has happened a stroke of luck urbanistico. The totally new and planned "neighborhood of the central station", with houses and offices, is next to the Schweizer Garten.
And perhaps another stroke of luck: House 21 could receive a reinforcement from another Krischanitz construction, as collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin temporary art room and, as you hear, negotiates with the city about a neighboring place in the Schweizer Garten.
Deutsche Bahn plans winter crisis package amounting to millions
The company has devised a crisis plan, which would prevent train breakdowns in winter.
The number of staff should be doubled.
Which costs millions.
In the fight against train breakdowns and delays caused by winter, Deutsche Bahn has spent more than 70 million euros this year, according to a newspaper report.
The newspaper "Bild" reported, invoking an internal crisis plan of the group, the planned investments until 2005 of a total of about 300 million euros.
In order to achieve better availability of vehicles and the rail network even in extreme weather.
Among other things, it plans to double internal and external employees to 16,000 positions to remove snow from tracks and platforms.
The goal is to clean the snow and ice platforms for operation and 90 percent of the needles needed for operation within four to five hours.
Two months ago, R<0xC3><0xBC>diger Grube, chairman of Deutsche Bahn, warned of train breakdowns and delays also this winter after a summit with government and industry.
Last winter Deutsche Bahn suffered considerable problems in passenger transport, as, among other things, it lacked reservations in the face of adverse weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for an authorization from the federal railway office for years.
There is also a delay in the delivery of high-speed trains.
Deutsche Bahn has been working for years to check the axles of high-speed trains frequently in the workshop, after a high-speed train suffered the breakage of an axle at Cologne central station.
Deutsche Bank pays millions in fines in the U.S.
After the turmoil over President Josef Ackerman, a new problem of the US appears, the Deutsche Bank must pay a million-dollar fine there.
As if the problems were not enough for Deutche Bank, its past in the US acquires the giant of the sector, the Frankfurt Institute pays 145 million dollars (106 million euros) in an agreement, to put an end to the disputes due to the bankruptcy of five large credit cooperatives during the financial crisis.
It is about the sale of mortgage securities.
The financial markets regulator NCUA rebukes many large banks for inducing credit unions with false promises to buy financial products; they have downplayed the risks.
Such bonds lost their value during the financial crisis and drag banks into the depths.
"We are pleased to be able to clarify the issue without the parties having to go to court," a spokesman for Deutsche Bank in New York said.
The bank admits no fault with the deal.
This also applies to Citigroup, which required a payment of $20.5 million.
Debbie Matz, president of the NCUA, welcomed the deference of both financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. credit unions and provides bankruptcy support to protect client investments.
The NCUA seeks to reinstate the losses of millions incurred.
Currently closed deals are its first type.
The regulator had also called other major banks to account and in the summer filed lawsuits against JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the matter of doubtful mortgage securities, these are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on housing credits.
When the U.S. housing bubble burst in 2007, it led to the downfall of many financial institutions.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Although the results happened a few years ago, a complicated wind is currently blowing for U.S. banks.
Investors and the inspection have engaged in countless processes to receive compensation or punish faults.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has produced the most lawsuits.
It reproaches the 18 big international banks that the two US state mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have taken advantage of the mortgage business in a volume of approximately 200 billion dollars.
Deutsche Bank also has a lawsuit from the FHFA, it deals with business worth 14.2 billion dollars from the year 2005 to 2007.
The inspection requires the Frankfurt Institute to account for "substantial losses", without naming an exact figure.
Deutsche Bank rejected the debts as unfounded and explained that it wants to defend itself.
Warren Buffett contributes $10 billion to IBM
The finance guru, Buffett, invests heavily in the information technology company IBM.
Since March, it has acquired shares worth more than $10 billion.
So far the great American investor Warren Buffett has always declared not to invest in computer companies or Information Technology since the forecasts of the long-term development of companies are negative.
But he has read IBM’s business report and changed his mind about investing in the sector.
He must have understood long before that IBM mainly offers services and procures computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
In the financial world, an investment by Warren Buffett is considered an honor.
Therefore, the Information Technology primitive should be called "Sir IBM".
Buffett revealed on CNBC that he has acquired IBM shares worth $10.7 billion since March.
Berkshire Hathaway is one of IBM’s largest shareholders with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said IBM has so far known nothing about the compromise.
He praised the leadership that dealt with ordinary profits in the economic crisis.
“They’ve done a great job,” Buffett said of the strategy.
IBM has for some time established lucrative Information Technology services as the operation of computing centers.
The 100-year-old IT pioneer also offers software and advice as well as powerful business equipment.
Buffett has avoided tech companies to date.
He said he only invested in companies whose businesses he understood.
On the contrary, Buffett took advantage of the occasion in a freight train, in a lubricant manufacturer or a mechanical engineer.
Its Berkshire Hathaway has about 80 subsidiaries of its own, as well as part of a whole series of large consortia such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, formerly M<0xC3><0xBC>nchener R<0xC3><0xBC>ck.
Buffett, 81, took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and, with wise investments, expanded it to become one of the most valuable companies in the world.
However, his lifestyle is humble.
That’s why it’s an idol for countless investors around the world.
His quick and unerring sense for making money has earned him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha."
After discovering Buffett’s investment, IBM’s shares on the stock market rose one percent.
"The Blue Giant," as IBM is known, has a market value of more than $220 billion and is, along with Apple and Microsoft, among the most valuable technology companies in the world.
With Microsoft, Buffett said, he doesn’t want to collaborate.
Bill Gates, its founder, is a close friend.
The threat becomes concrete
After the discovery of "the Zwickau cell", the Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper speaks of a "bloody ideology" that is rekindled.
The murders of eight small Greek businessmen and tricks between 2001 and 2006 have a background of the far right.
In Turkey and the German population of Turkish origin has reacted with fear and concern to this news.
For many Germans of Turkish origin, a ghost returns that was thought to be long dead, since the M<0xC3><0xB6>lln bombings in November 1992 and the Solingen bombings in May 1993, there had been no more episodes of far-right violence against Turks.
However, it has never been questioned that there is xenophobia in Germany.
The far-right network uncovered reveals a magnitude whose dimensions were far from predictable.
"Does the bloody ideology revive?" headlines the online edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The "Sabah" newspaper, on the other hand, points out that one of the perpetrators of the crime was an informant from the Federal Office for the Defense of the Constitution and is concerned that the German authorities may be involved in the far-right swamp.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted sensibly, the weekend reminded victims of racist violence with a vigil at the Brandenburg Gate.
Two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin together with German and Turkish politicians reflected on a solemn act of the fiftieth anniversary of the Turkish-German agreement.
The coexistence was staged with cheerful colors, like a story with a happy ending.
The information came to some Turkish media as a slap in the face: “The German gift for the fiftieth anniversary,” says the title of an article on the Turkish internet platform “Haber X,” referring to the background of the chain of murders.
The German broadcast "H<0xC3><0xBC>rriyet" also does not insist on tracing this mental connection.
“It starts to smell bad,” says the title of Ahmet K<0xC3><0xBC>lahci’s column.
It highlights that those killed were people who paid their taxes and made an important contribution with their work to the reconstruction of Germany.
On the Internet forums of Germans of Turkish origin, the behavior of the police and their subsequent success in searches are discussed very critically.
The authors are astonished that the German authorities have not looked much earlier for suspects in the far-right circle.
Some are even less rhetorical about the drastic means: "From now on, immigrants have nothing left but self-defense and armaments."
"This will be the best self-protection."
“Germany’s internal peace depends heavily on the quality of the clarification and the adequacy of the sanction to the entire network,” writes Selen.
This means that, if the internal peace of Germany is in danger, the attacks in M<0xC3><0xB6>lln and Solingen will be clarified in ninety years.
The image of the ruins of the Solingen fire has been engraved in German and Turkish memories.
No other event showed more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a concrete threat, and to the Germans that mistrust and distance can lead to violence.
The attacks sharpen the Turkish side’s group sentiment.
Don’t repeat the mistakes of the past
The Turkish press was then mainly critical of the inadequacy of German policy after the attacks, Helmut Kohl refusing to visit the survivors of M<0xC3><0xB6>lln.
After the Solingen fire attack, he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish president, and Klaus Kinkel, his foreign minister, replaced him at the funeral in Cologne.
It is clear how the value of a person is calculated according to the amount of his taxes.
The current information in the Turkish media once again shows how profound the distrust of many Germans of Turkish origin in the legality of this country has been since then.
In addition to the effort of a broad explanation and a reassessment of far-right terrorism in Germany, this time frank words are needed.
The bank of the Lake Zurich scandal
The riskiest bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS nearly went bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since slid from one crisis to the next.
Now it's run by a German.
I'm sure Axel Weber hadn't thought of that.
After his spectacular departure from the summit of the federal bank, in July it became known that in 2013 he would start in a new and almost equally spectacular job: Chairman of the board of directors of the large Swiss bank UBS, an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber rejoices publicly, praises Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly acquired solidity and drops kind remarks about his future companions.
“USB has achieved a revitalization.”
"I am happy to collaborate with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Gr<0xC3><0xBC>bel."
In September it became clear that everything would be totally different.
A USB financial operator in London avoided all of the bank’s security systems and defrauded 1.7 billion euros.
Oswald Gr<0xC3><0xBC>bel, CEO of USB, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to attend.
The chairman of the USB board has since considered himself equally touched, and everyone asked: When does Axel Weber arrive?
Weber has been expected to advise the bank since February 2012.
And he will take over the chairmanship of the board in May, not early 2013, the bank said Tuesday.
This is hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, but rather, a professor of economics and a counselor and has had a period of adaptation that is surely necessary.
Suddenly he takes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just proven again that it deserves the title "the largest scandal bank in Europe" for a long time.
On the one hand, USB is huge, until recently it was the world’s largest asset manager, and on the other hand, for years, it has slid from one scandal to the next.
Nothing, it seems, is spared the once so proud Swiss bank.
The financial crisis began.
The USB had an excellent reputation until 2007.
The image of the discreet and solid Swiss asset manager, but also cunning, was combined with ambitious goals, he also wanted to be a large number in investment banks.
At $1.6 trillion, USB handles more money from wealthy customers than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, it advanced as an investment bank in the league of the world’s big banks.
This impresses.
Hans Geiger, the former banker and later professor of banking in Zurich for many years explains: "Before my students, I have always qualified the USB as a model of a good bank."
"From today's point of view, one wonders: How could I be wrong?"
I was making a big mistake.
In 2007 it came to light that something went very wrong on the USB.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, CEO, who until then was regarded as a brilliant and very intelligent banker, resigned surprisingly.
A few months later, the reason was suspected.
The bank’s investment fund embarked on losses with high-risk securities and had to amortize billions.
To cope with this, USB announced a capital injection of no less than 13 billion francs.
For this he found investors, of course, who some looked down on until shortly before: an opaque Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, so discreet, that his name had never been heard of.
This was just the first blow.
In April 2008, it got worse.
The bank had to declare the loss of billions, Marcel Ospel, chairman of the board, in 2006 at Switzerland’s second-highest-paid board, resigned.
In October 2008, the catastrophe continued, in view of its wrong investments, UBS found itself in the financial crisis facing bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the state.
The national bank bought problematic securities from UBS for many billions, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a mandatory convertible bond, through which it became co-owner of the bank.
All of Switzerland was affected, it was asserted how dramatic this was for a small country, if it hosts such large banks.
Finally, the sum of UBS’s balance sheet in 2007 was more than five times larger than Switzerland’s economic performance (see chart).
“We can’t rescue UBS again,” said Geiger, a banking expert.
The first disaster was joined by the second.
A few months later, UBS capitulated in a tax dispute with America and was willing to hand over the data of wealthy customers, who had possibly defrauded taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, it approves a figure of 780 billion dollars, reimbursement of unjustified benefits of these businesses with compensation for payment.
With this, UBS confessed more or less to having helped in the tax fraud.
Simultaneously he lost something that had always been his capital in the competition for rich customers: the halo of discretion.
After the scandal, the secret of the Swiss bank is no longer the same.
This was followed by the resignation of the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of client funds.
In this way, in a few months the bank lost its credibility in its two central sectors: in investment banking through erroneous speculations and in the administration of goods through the aid to tax fraud.
And just when it was getting a little quieter, just when it was thought that UBS was getting it back, this unfortunate story of the operator happens, an individual operator defrauded 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realized that something was wrong.
And it turned out, apparently, this still doesn’t work well with risk management in investment banking.
“The Adoboli case shows that risk controls have changed too little,” says Martin Janssen, a professor of economics and finance at the Banking Institute at the University of Zurich.
The chief financial officer of a large German bank is also sure: "The problem with UBS is that it does not master risk controls."
So the idea arose of caution, with which the Swiss bankers presented themselves for a long time, to be the guardians of the greatest assets in the world: no risk too great, on the other hand, the security of money wants to break on the other side of the Alpine republic.
The security deposits of Swiss banks were the symbol of unwavering reliability, like Lindt and Spr<0xC3><0xBC>ngli of authentic chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich doesn’t fit the cliché of the solid Swiss private bank, it’s just a bit older.
The situation is classic.
The bank is headquartered on Zurich’s Bahnhofstra<0xC3><0x9F>e, which runs from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, framed by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
Here the buildings are ostentatious, the rents are one of the highest in Europe.
Here you will find jewelers such as Tiffany<0x60>s among traditional Swiss businesses such as the Spr<0xC3><0xBC>ngli confectionery.
Swiss banks have been here for years: from the national bank, through the Credit Suisse palace, to elitist private banks like Julius B<0xC3><0xA4>r.
You enter the reception room of the UBS through a heavy revolving door.
Inside the walls are covered with marble, in front are large leather armchairs, next to the bank logo there is a large sign to indicate "security".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: Safety.
The two big Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, have at some point displaced the idea of the big Swiss bank, or betrayed it, as the president of a small private Swiss bank thinks.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all he does, like all Swiss bankers, also with the business of both big banks.
UBS has become too big, he believes, mainly in investment banking, where Anglo-Saxons have gained ground.
The Swiss had nothing else to say.
"And they have long been accustomed to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
In fact, UBS changed Anglo-Saxon investment banking, delivered its first big profit and then came disaster, no European financial institution had lost as much money in the high-risk jungle as the big Swiss bank.
On October 15, 2008, the catastrophe was evident.
"On Wednesday, the government coalition of the small country of seven million decided on the largest rescue operation in the history of its nation," writes author Lukas H<0xC3><0xA4>ssig in his book "Der UBS-Crash" ("The UBS crash" in Spanish).
Politicians granted up to 68 billion francs or about 45 billion euros to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
What do you think?
They talk to the Swiss bankers, so they see the problem in the dimension of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three large Swiss banks merged into a powerful consortium.
A bank emerges that, due to the merger, was too big for little Switzerland, and continues to grow.
So it served to complement the two different precursor banks of the UBS: a rich but sleepy bank with the center of the administration of goods in Zurich and a poorer but stronger internationalization.
Suddenly, the internationalized investment banks arrived in a timely manner with a lot of money, with which they could roll a large financial bicycle.
There are two names related to this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, head of the UBS consortium from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the board of directors.
“I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a perfect team,” says banking expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the intellectual, modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive who managed to make his way from learning at the bank to the summit."
Finally, Ospel trusted Wuffli.
And in the end Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake: “He thought his models were a reality,” Geiger says.
"It's a tragic case."
Tragic, perhaps.
It is clear: the folly came before the case.
UBS employees clearly remember the board meetings, in which Wuffli, the head of the consortium, always repeated the same motto: Down from the throne to Goldman Sachs.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
They topped the “League Tables,” the rankings that then documented the banks’ success.
UBS wanted to be at the top.
Some steps went well for him.
In foreign exchange trading and stock trading I was on top.
However, the corporate advisers in charge highlighted a weak point: In the business of international interest, in the language of "fixed income" banking, there is a huge compensation for large banks.
UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
To fill these gaps, UBS began an adventure that almost cost it its existence.
Avid for growth, they invested both the same bank and one of their high-risk funds created in high-risk American investments.
It became a powerful machine for securitizing American mortgage loans and then selling them, maintaining certain risks on its own.
And also, like other banks sought the downside for a long time.
“In the summer of 2007, as the American real estate market was on fire, UBS bought there,” said Geiger, a banking expert.
So great the euphoria, so deep the fall.
A manager had to leave, as the attempt to order proved more complicated than they expected.
Positions at UBS became projectable seats and are unsafe to this day.
Currently, who runs a large bank, has a job almost impossible.
You need to find a strategy for a bank, before which all logical business models are lost.
Geiger, a banking expert, has an idea, to end investment banking, focus on asset management, go back to Swiss roots.
The bank doesn’t want to go that far (yet).
But investment banking needs to go down a lot, it’s clear now.
The following Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the new president of the bank, will present his future strategy to the world.
In reality, only the 51-year-old Italian-Swiss was thought of as a transitional solution, as the bank the bank surprisingly parted ways with its predecessor Gr<0xC3><0xBC>bel.
He must permanently run UBS’s business, the Zurich bank said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return the investment bank to its state in the mid-1990s.
It eliminates 3,500 jobs.
But this is not enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who's that?
What do you want to make money with?
These are the questions Axel Weber is sure to ask today.
So far he only says that he will first look for housing with his wife in Zurich.
The following year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on U.S. stock market
The looming recession in Europe has spooked U.S. investors at the start of the week.
The changes of government in Athens and Rome remain ineffective.
Industrial production curbed on the continent stifles hopes of stabilising a debt crisis at its source.
General relief might not be imposed on the changes of government in Rome and Athens.
The euro fell against the dollar.
Last week, the Italian and Greek glass has looked half full, not half empty, but now the problems are coming back to the fore, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
First of all, financial assets are on the sales list.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 0.6 percent at 12,078 points.
In the session, the market barometer ranges between 12,027 and 12,170 points.

In Frankfurt, the Dax index is down 1.2 percent to 5,985 points.
The industry of the 17 euro countries has clearly reduced its production and is at the end of its boom.
Companies produced 2% less in September than the previous month, as reported by Eurostat’s statistics office.
That created skepticism among U.S. investors: “We’re not an island, we’re dependent,” said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe cannot be freed so quickly from a recession, and there are more signs of weakness in banks.
Warren Buffett, the investment legend, only confirmed this precaution, it is still unclear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything necessary to end the crisis, he said in an interview with CNBC.
That is why, from their point of view, it is too early to invest in state loans or European banks.
Instead, it throws a decade of old principles overboard and enters the American tech sector.

Smart Fats Spread in Cities
In many places, grasshoppers are considered “problem birds”: these intelligent animals are not expelled from cities for a long time, experts say.
Some like them, others want to get rid of them very quickly, the grajos belong for years to the image of the city, but in many municipalities the complaints of the neighbors for the dirt and the noise of the animals accumulate.
Although no means have appeared against the "problem birds" so far.
Grasses no longer leave cities, say experts at the first symposium on grasses in Leer, East Frisia.
There, specialists from all over the country discuss possible solutions.
Search for alternatives in cities
Environmentalists attribute the problems of cities to the migration of certain protected grasses from the countryside; chemical applications in agriculture visibly do away with traditional living spaces.
The hunting, the growing building and the fall of trees that host them make the life of the birds difficult.
Fats are protected.
There are large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs in Soest, Westphalia, among others, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen, as well as in Leer.
There in 2005 a controversial project to mass kill the district’s cocks jumped to the negative headlines.
Critics have called the hunting of animals by bird traps and stick killing especially brutal.
"By expelling them and driving them away in a normal way, nothing is achieved," said Werner Kl<0xC3><0xB6>ver, an urban planner and landscape architect from Leer.
Firing nests with water or throwing trees are often unintended consequences, says Manfred Kaiser, an environmental expert from Lahr, Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg.
“Animals deviate, large colonies divide and distribute elsewhere.”
To drive them away is only imaginable as an exception in hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
"We must live with them, we no longer catch them."
Without the surroundings, the problem in the cities cannot be solved, says Wolfgang Kellner, mayor of Leer.
A combination of driving animals away from sensitive residential areas and baiting them back to settle elsewhere is possible.
"Information panels instead of chainsaws" Uta Maria J<0xC3><0xBC>rgens, psychologist and ethnologist advertises against it in order to treat animals in a totally different way: "The best thing is that we can hold a peak in the face with aplomb."
J<0xC3><0xBC>rgens co-founded in Schleswig-Holstein the teaching circuit on Ascheberger’s grasshoppers, where signs inform about the life of intelligent birds.
Meanwhile, the project is accepted by tourists.
J<0xC3><0xBC>rgens also has his own take on criticism for bird noise: "It's all forms of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of these animals are legendary, the bucks not only take advantage of the resources to access schist bites, but they manufacture tools to use them as resources.
Recently, ethologists from the University of Cambridge checked in four quills how far the intelligence of birds reaches.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to drop a stone onto a platform to reach a moth larva.
Without much training, they determinedly recognized the size and shape of the stone needed to land on the platform.
In a second trial, the crafty bucks had to solve a complicated problem.
The researchers placed a small cube with a moth larva in a vertical cylinder.
The birds could not reach their prey with the beak.
But the researchers left them a piece of wire.
With which the four animals formed a hook, with which they fished the bucket on the handle of the tube.
Three of the four fathoms got it on the first try.
Portugal at Euro 2012 thanks to Cristiano Ronaldo
The Bosnians and the Turks have no hope in the championship.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland will also be at Euro 2012.

The Bosnians, who didn’t show up in the first half, had their first clear chance thanks to goalscorer Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburg player, leader of England's Manchester City sent a header to the club, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33).
Jiracek got it right for the Czech Republic
Collegiate Wolfgang Stark, of Ergolding, was then in the eye of the hurricane.
After the attack on Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penati area, he decided to show the Portuguese the yellow card for throwing himself to the ground (36.).
On the opposite side, Stark took a controversial penalty following an action by Fabio Coentrao, which transformed Misimovic.
After the break, the 2004 European runner-up clarified everything with 4 goals.
The Czechs ended the last doubt in the 81st minute with a goal from Petr Jiracek.
The 1976 European champion qualified for Euro 1976 for the fifth time in a row.
Coach Michal Bilek’s team with Bundesliga legionnaire Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1. FC N<0xC3><0xBC>rnberg) were also lucky and had to overcome a second of reaction in the initial phase.
At the last moment, goalkeeper Petr Cech avoided a possible own goal by Tomas Sivok (9.).
Montenegro had more chances with duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic in action.
Damjanovic scored in the 40th minute. of the frontal lap, very right in the goal of Cech.
After the break the Czechs had to protect the goalkeeper's crossbar, the FC Seoul striker escaped again (50.).
Finally, the goal before the end decided the match.
Meanwhile, Turkey has squandered the wonder of Zagreb football.
Four days after the 0-3 draw in Istanbul, the Turks did not make it past a 0-0 draw in Zagreb.
While it was almost certain that national coach Guus Hiddink would have to leave his seat on the third-tier bench for the 2002 World Cup, the Croatians celebrated their fourth participation in the Euro final.
In front of 31,000 spectators at the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks almost got a dream start.
In the seventh minute and with a long-distance kick, Selcuk Inan only managed to touch the post. Attacker Kazim Kazim was also unable to send the ball inside the goal.
After the second reaction, Croatia took more and more control.
After the break, Croatia did not allow any goals to be scored.
Alongside Mario Mandzukic of VfL Wolfsburg, who in the 62nd minute made up for Dortmund’s Ivan Perisic, Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) are the Bundesliga’s legionnaires in practice.
Trapattoni goes to the European Championship
In Dublin, the Irish celebrate the first participation in the Euro since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who triumphed with the 4-0 in the first leg prepared for a previous decision, put himself in the lead in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) drew with the invited team.
Ireland pushed from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, when Robbie Keane of the Los Angeles Galaxy got his first big break.
From the first moment, the Estona defense avoided possible goals of advantage.
But in the 32nd minute, he got ahead of him.
After a defense from goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward appeared and kicked the ball across the line, getting the 1-0.

So far, SAP is present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
Approximately 4,000 of SAP’s more than 176,000 international customers are based in boom country.
Growth plans in China are also an important element of the dax consortium’s 2012 strategy.
SAP wants to increase its sales volume for 2015 to 20 billion euros.
Last year, it received approximately 12.5 billion euros.
Today, the software provider’s business, which employs 50,000 workers worldwide, is doing as well as it has in the past.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
"Currently we want to expand our activities (...)," explained McDermott.
“Our goal is to activate lasting growth in China through extensive instruction.”
Massacres on a personal level
Peter Englund’s intense and generous new book, The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of World War I, “begins with a long dramatis personae of the kind that can make one’s soul fall at one’s feet.
Here are some action tips: Gently start this page and turn it into your brand pages.
He will get to know these people very well in Mr. Englund’s novelistic narrative, and this dramatis personae will function as his GPS, a beacon during those few moments when, as one of his men and women, he is confused and helpless in the fog of war.
Mr Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize for Literature.
What he has written here is an unusual book, which he aptly describes as "a work of anti-history."
It contains some notable names, important treatises or famous battles; there are practically no ambassadors, elegant journalists or discussions about tactics or material.
It's not so much a book about what happened, he explains, as "a book about how it happened," it's about "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods."
The beauty and pain of battle combines the wartime experiences of about 20 ordinary men and women, on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and administrators.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Some will become prisoners of war, or lose their limbs, go mad, or die.
Their lives flash here like votive candles lit in a church; new ones are added to the mix while others are extinguished.
Mr. Englund's book is a departure from the standard history books.
It is also a corrective to the notion that World War I was only the fateful trench war on the Western Front.
"The beauty and pain of battle" moves expertly through other theaters of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book have hives falling on them; one spends Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; tsetse flies are an intractable problem.
This is a moving book, almost from the beginning.
The war floods the lives of these people like a natural catastrophe, a Hurricane Katrina that stinks of cordite.
When artillery fire is heard in the distance, and you are a woman who is at home with your children, do you stay or run away?
Anyway, who's coming?
Almost no one understands what is happening, not even why this war has to be fought.
“Factlessness,” observes Mr. Englund, “has been filled with conjectures, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares, and rumors.”
"The Beauty and the Grief of Battle" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor in the high seas fleet.
His stories have been obtained mostly from memoirs, letters, and other previously published material.
The explanations of their lives may be terrifying or poignant, but they are more alive in Mr. Englund’s accumulation of little moments, lost details.
Many of these are about privation and coping with what there is.
About telling the story of a German schoolgirl says: "Substitutes, everywhere substitutes."
"Coffee substitute, fake aluminum, faux rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He continues to talk about substitute food in Germany.
It describes "meat made from rice cooked and pressed into ram fat (and topped with a fake bone made of wood); tobacco made from roots and peels of dried potatoes; shoes with wooden soles."
There are, he notes, “837 permitted meat substitutes in sausage production, 511 registered coffee substitutes.”
Some stories are about honor and courage.
An American recognizes his own drive toward savagery and states about war: "You feel that, after all, this is what men are designed for and not to sit in armchairs with a cigar and a whiskey, the afternoon paper or a best seller, and pretend that that varnish means civilization and that there is no barbarian behind that starchy, studded door."
Instead a British soldier realizes that he will probably die, and that no one will find out or care.
“Once one resigns oneself to the thought of sacrificing, one would like to think that it could happen in front of the public,” he writes.
Instead, it is horribly like “a condemned man being strangled in secret.”
Other observations are about an old Europe disappearing, and about new types of terror.
“Conflict has increasingly become an economic competition,” writes Mr. Englund, “a war between factories.”
It reflects the arrival of what he calls “a new species in the bestiary of the young century: the eloquent and ideologically convinced mass murderer in well-made clothes who executes his butchery while sitting behind a desk.”
People behave in unexpected ways; there is both ignoble and heroic behavior.
Mr. Englund speaks of soldiers who actively tried to catch a venereal disease from prostitutes as a way of evading service at the front.
“The most grotesque expression of this can be seen in the gonococcal pus trade, which soldiers buy and smear their genitals with it in the hope of ending up in the hospital,” he writes.
“Those who are truly desperate rub it over their eyes, often resulting in lifelong blindness.”
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund’s prose, nimble but not extravagant, is perfectly suited to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes it reflects the way in which the war has “unleashed exceptionally uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred.”
People start asking why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books about the First World War have often been indirect, such as The Great War and the Modern Memory of Paul Fussell, or novels such as No Novels on the Front by Erich Maria Remarque, rather than comprehensive stories.
Mr. Englund's volume joins an unconventional pantheon.
His book has one of the most devastating endings I can remember in a nonfiction work.
I won't reveal it.
But it is as if he had come from his book, torn from your fingers that page of dramatis personae, and burned it with a match.
After a previous misstep, a planned assault to the minute
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing riot helmets.
It was chosen Monday night to Tuesday because Zuccotti Park would be emptier.
The operation was kept secret except for a few high-ranking officers, initially telling the others that they were joining an exercise.
Police Inspector Raymond W. Kelly was at the center, his presence underscoring how the operation was fraught with challenges for the police department.
Episodes of recent weeks, such as pepper spraying protesters, breaking department rules and creating a storm of public sympathy for the squatters, could not be repeated.
And so the police operation to clear Zuccotti Park of protesters was revealed after two weeks of planning and training.
The agents had prepared themselves by seeing how the occupations had developed in other cities.
A major disaster drill was taking place on Randalls Island, with one eye on Zuccotti.
Agents ramped up so-called disorder training — counterterrorism measures that involved quickly mobilizing large numbers of police officers — to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
Orders to enter the park came at the “last minute,” said someone familiar with the orders, which referred to the mission only as “an exercise.”
“To the few cops I know who were called for this, they didn’t tell them it was to get into Zuccotti Park,” said the person, who spoke anonymously.
"The only people who knew they were going to enter Zuccotti Park were at the highest levels of the department."
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson learned by the city.
On October 14, agents wanted to clear the park, but gave up when hundreds of protesters emerged early after hearing about the plans.
Tuesday’s operation involved officers from several police units, including special forces from across the municipal district — scores of mobile officers who routinely flooded high-crime neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said many people, like those who commute to work daily, had been coming and going from the park during the day, making 1 a.m. a good time to get in.
“It was appropriate to do so when there were the fewest people in the park,” he said.
Emergency Services Unit trucks with spotlights and speakers congregated at the Pike Slip crossing with Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before leaving.
The lights and pre-recorded messages rumbling from the loudspeakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
Community affairs officers went to the park with their light blue windbreakers, many protesters simply picked up their things and left.
No store was touched until 1:45 a.m., police said, giving protesters time to collect their belongings.
Other teams of agents were seen gathering at the perimeter to enter if arrests needed to be made in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesman for the Police Department, said it was for his safety.
But many journalists said attempts were made to prevent them from seeing the police spring into action in the park, and that they had been treated abruptly by officers.
Mr Browne said mobile TV units on Church Street, along the western edge of the park, were able to capture images.
As police moved westward through the demonstrators’ dense tangle of personal belongings, including luggage and paper and plastic trash bags crammed with clothes, teams from the Department of Cleanup followed them, picking up what was left behind.
Some protesters who refused to move were dragged out, images appearing on the Internet shortly thereafter.
A central group of protesters took up positions near the camp’s kitchen area, near the center of the park.
Some made a barrier, and the police came in to methodically arrest them.
About 10 people in the epicenter of the camp locked themselves in each other’s arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Emergency responders were called to cut the locks.
No arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The clearance operation was complete about 75 minutes later, police said.
Mr Browne said about 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests were for “disruption of public order and resistance to authority,” he said.
The highest-ranking agent on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, the department head, the uniformed senior officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the department’s chief of detectives, was also there.
Mr. Kelly, while present, “wasn’t directing the operations,” Mr. Browne said.
A second group of agents waited along the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Streets, in case they had to enter.
Barricades were erected on Cortlandt Street, a block to the north of the park, and Pine Street, a block to the south.
From those positions, police were seen widening the perimeter even beyond Zuccotti Park.
At one point, a number of agents, many of them with shields, were seen pushing people out.
There were about 28 people on the northern perimeter.
Some of the loudest action of the night took place south of the park.
At about 5 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protester jumped on the hood of a police car, and others were seen taking air off the wheels of a police van.
At one point, a piece of plywood flew out of the crowd.
In the end, an officer and a protester were hospitalized.
Support workers union to sue city over layoffs
The union representing hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to sue the city on Wednesday, claiming the layoffs were unnecessary and discriminatory because of their disproportionate impact on schools serving poor students.
The lawsuit is possibly the latest weapon at the disposal of the union, from municipal district 37, in its effort to revoke the layoffs.
Six hundred and seventy-two school aides, parent coordinators and other employees who were among the city’s lowest-paid lost their jobs on Oct. 7, in a move union leaders have described as political revenge for their refusal last spring to allow the city access to a health care fund run by working groups to close its budget gap.
The municipal authorities have categorically denied this accusation.
At a hearing at City Hall last month, education counselor Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were a part of the budget approved in June.
One council member countered by telling him that nothing in the budget specified that school support staff members would be fired.
City district officials said they filed the complaint in writing, warning the Department of Education that it would be sued. A press conference will be held Wednesday to announce the official filing of the lawsuit, at the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The lawsuit will include Mr. Walcott and the city’s Department of Education as defendants, and has eight workers laid off as plaintiffs, all of them black or Latino women, as well as most of the attendees who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city’s Legal Department, said the city had not seen the lawsuit and therefore could not comment on its specific allegations.
According to a draft of the lawsuit obtained by The New York Times, the union has focused on the number of layoffs at schools in poor areas of the city to support a claim for unfair treatment, saying poor schools lost more assistants as they had been chronically undersubsidized.
It is noted that while there were no layoffs on Staten Island and a few layoffs at schools on the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school assistants lost their jobs in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were laid off in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Given the loss of five of the eight attendees employed by Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit says, “This is not a neighborhood of wealthy parents who can raise funds to cover the budget deficit.”
P.S. The 36th district’s budget shrank by 3.26 percent this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the way it calculates additional funding for each enrollment per poor student in schools.
The union also claims that high school principals may have been misled by language in a memo authorizing the firing of parent coordinators.
The memo used the word "surplus" to describe the action, even though "surplus" most often describes the act of moving a teacher from a school's payroll to a job bank, the salaries of which are paid by the central office.
“Sixty-six parent coordinators were fired,” the complaint’s draft reads, “and not just in surplus.”
Mission Completed, Congress Prepared to Reach Agreement on Libya
It seems that finally Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill are willing to agree on something related to the uprising in Libya.
All that was needed was for the rebellion to succeed, for veteran dictator Muammar Gaddafi to be captured and killed, and for U.S. involvement to come to an end.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will consider a resolution, sponsored by President John Kerry (Democrat of Massachusetts), along with Senators John McCain (Republican of Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (independent of Connecticut), applauding Libyans for their successful rebellion and U.S. troops for their “courage.”
“This resolution is to honor the brave people of Libya as they begin to rebuild their country,” Kerry said.
“It’s an affirmation of bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations.”
The language may seem harmless, but nothing about the Libya debate has been easy so far.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties were bickering with each other and with the White House over drafting a series of resolutions to approve or reject the role of the U.S. military in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution authorizing the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated in the House by a wide bipartisan margin, and it never got a vote in the Senate.
But on the same day the bill was rejected in the House, the chamber also rejected a measure that would have cut funding for U.S. operations in Libya.
That left the U.S. mission in a kind of legislative purgatory — with Congress upset enough to criticize Obama’s handling of the mission, but not so angry as to actually mow the grass under his feet.
Then the indecision of the Congress was overcome by events.
Tripoli fell to Libyan rebels in August, and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
Now the Senate could be ready to act.
The Foreign Affairs Committee resolution “congratulates the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and extraordinary resistance to liberate themselves” and “commends the men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism.”
The resolution also “declares the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya.”
Will the new measure win the full support of the foreign affairs committee, or will it divide lawmakers like the June bill did?
The latest version was rejected by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indiana), the committee’s top Republican.
Lugar’s spokesman said Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new bill.
On the other side of the Capitol, the House is going to vote this week on a constitutional amendment demanding a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republican congressmen and some Democrats.
The measure, sponsored by Republican Bob Goodlatte (R-Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other issue that actually gets a vote of the entire assembly in the House or Senate in this Congress.
Other lawmakers have so far been unsuccessful in getting their amendments to the assembly, but not for lack of attempts.
Goodlatte’s is just one of 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced in this Congress, covering a wide range of issues.
Some are duplicates - the same bill is proposed in both the House and the Senate - and others with slight variations from each other.
There are at least 15 versions of the budget balance amendment in the House alone, and another handful that will “control federal spending.”
Some of those bills are also identical to each other, but they give their backers — especially rookie Republicans looking to refine their resumes — a chance to brag that they were the “authors” of such a measure.
The Budget Control Act, which passed in August, required both the House and Senate to vote on an amendment to the budget balance.
In March, 58 senators voted in favor of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of that amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of terms that members of Congress can serve, while Rep. Jose E. Serrano (D-N.Y.) wants to remove the two-term limit for presidents.
Rep. Jesse L. Jackson, Jr. (D-Ill.) has proposed a series of amendments that guarantee the right to quality education and health care, among other issues.
An amendment banning same-sex marriage is a perennial proposal, as is one banning flag burning.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if they are rejected by two-thirds of states.
So enthusiastic that members have been at proposing amendments, they are not moving at a faster pace than in previous years.
At the 111th Congress, legislators proposed 77 amendments, and introduced 66 at the 110th.
The pace is unacceptable compared to the 1990s, when members regularly filed more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they weren’t much more successful then than they are now.
The last amendment that was added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but was in fact proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Struck but not defeated," Giffords speaks in his first TV interview since the shooting
Ten months after a gunman shot her at point-blank range at a constituent rally in Tucson, Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.) appeared on national television Monday night, sang along with the Broadway tune “The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow,” and said she wanted to recover more than she wanted to return to Congress.
In his ABC News appearance "20/20," with Diane Sawyer, Giffords struggled to form prayers and needed help walking.
The program documented his difficult way back from the damage caused by a bullet that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of his brain, passing from the front to the back of his head.
Three months ago, he unexpectedly returned to the House to cast his triumphant vote on the debt ceiling agreement.
In his first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six and wounded 13, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang — and described his recovery as “difficult.”
When Sawyer asked how he feels, Giffords, 41, replied, “Pretty good.”
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hour-long "20/20" special, which aired the day before the publication of the couple's new book, "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope."
The special program looked at Giffords’ recovery from the Jan. 8 shooting.
In videos recorded by Kelly in the first few weeks, she is seen in her hospital bed, her head shaved and a long scar running through her forehead.
She can only hold one or two fingers up while her husband encourages her.
Months later, Giffords is seen sitting in a wheelchair as therapists teach her how to perform simple actions.
A head move.
A puckering of the lips.
And then, his first word: "What."
Within days, Giffords uttered another word — “toast,” a request for change on his breakfast menu.
Videos released by ABC show that music played a central role in Giffords' recovery: The congresswoman is seen singing along with therapists Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty's "Free Falling."
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who does two hours of therapy every day, said he doesn’t remember the day of the shooting.
Her husband said he was reading Giffords a newspaper article about the March 12 murder when she stopped him to ask for the first time about the six who had died in the incident.
Suspect gunman Jared Lee Loughner is being held in a Missouri prison and is being forcibly medicated while awaiting trial.
“A lot of people died,” Giffords told Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
Kelly told Sawyer that at one point in his wife's recovery, she said, "I've been defeated."
"So, I said, 'Gabby, you haven't been defeated,'" Kelly said.
"You've just been hit.
And you’re going to come out of this, and you’re going to recover and you’re going to come back stronger than ever.”
Troops make you feel more pity than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
At that time, several hundred soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines stormed into their posts around him.
The etiquette crowd stood up and applauded.
“Men and women were regarded as heroes,” said David Saltzman, who organized the spring fundraiser.
A high-ranking military officer at the gala, also known as the then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of troops differently.
“They showed them as some kind of orphaned child,” the officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know they had them.
But it wasn't respect, really.
The markedly contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship that has gripped the military and an often distant, sometimes adoring, American public.
The troops are lavished with praise for their sacrifices.
But praise comes at a price, service members say.
The public increasingly acts as if those uniformed ones are pitied.
"We're not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon depart for Afghanistan.
“But it seems that the only way for some to show their support is to put ourselves in the role of helpless souls.”
The issue is a very sensitive one for military leaders, who do not want to appear ungrateful or at odds with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger that the returning troops faced in the final years of the Vietnam War was far worse.
As a result, most conversations about pity take place quietly and privately among war veterans.
After their two sons returned from combat with the Marine Corps, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that people other than the military would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with a sense of fear as they confronted the insurgents and traveled to exotic locations.
Others would wonder if there would be an “angry and violent veteran under the surface,” said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to a high-level government job in Washington.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some interviewers had subtly asked him if he would be able to withstand the pressure of a demanding job from Washington immediately after his combat tour.
“When you talk about your service, you need to deal with negative impressions,” Cancian recalled telling his children.
Military unrest arises, in part, from American indifference to wars.
Achievements on the battlefield are rarely chosen for praise by a country that has little familiarity with the military and sees little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“We, as a nation, no longer value military heroism in ways that were quite common in World War II,” said retired Lt. Gen. David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, praise from politicians and the public largely focuses on the depth of a service member’s suffering.
Troops are recognized by the number of tours they have endured, the number of friends they have lost, or the extent of their injuries.
Army Faces Growing Pressure to End Rape
This week, a landmark hearing will decide whether 28 women and men have a case against the military for their alleged passivity to rape.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs are organizing for the next one.
Private Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years and 11 weeks pregnant the night she says she was raped by a partner.
It was October 2008, and he was heading back to his barracks at Miramar Air Force Base, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend when he encountered a colleague carrying a 12-pack of beer.
He asked if he could join her in her room for a drink.
“It sounded an alarm signal,” Lyman says.
The Texas native, however, brushed aside her concern.
I thought, no, he's 19.
"He's from Texas," he says.
"I wish I'd listened to my instincts."
Within minutes of entering Lyman’s room, the man approached her from behind, pulling her down and raping her, she alleges.
This week, on Nov. 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel are eagerly awaiting a court decision in a landmark trial in Arlington, Va., that will decide whether their lawsuit against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will go to trial.
The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to reduce widespread rape among the military, in violation of soldiers’ constitutional rights.
Filed in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer in Washington, D.C., the lawsuit initially involved 17 plaintiffs, but grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all of whom claim they were raped or sexually assaulted by their peers, and that the military failed to investigate, prosecute, or deliver adequate justice after the alleged assaults.
Burke says he's going for the top of the army, because the problem starts with them.
“The military is a top-down structure,” he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation? The high command."
Burke also says that since February, about 400 more survivors have contacted her, many of whom could be part of future lawsuits.
His strategy: Instead of piling up all the plaintiffs in this case, putting all the eggs in one basket, so to speak, he’s going to file several cases, if necessary, to keep up the pressure.
The defense team for the Department of Defense, headed by U.S. Attorney Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defense strategy — in essence, that the military cannot be sued by current or former soldiers for injuries sustained in the armed forces.
By a 1950 Supreme Court ruling called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not liable for damages suffered by active duty personnel.
“The alleged damages are part of the plaintiffs’ military service,” the documents say.
The Department of Defense declined to comment for this article.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women are still officially forbidden from serving in combat, this distinction is only nominal: Modern wars rarely have clear front lines.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers are playing increasingly important roles, especially in reaching local women in war zones.
The result: between those two wars, 150 female soldiers have been killed and two-thirds of them in combat situations.
It’s time for the military to modernize, too, Burke says.
She is not alone in her struggle, and three other demands are underway in addition to her own.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Services Clinic is preparing a case against the four major military academies for allegedly promoting a misogynistic environment.
On the other hand, the non-profit organization Vietnam Veterans of America is filing a lawsuit against the military that focuses on “personality disorder” diagnoses assigned to rape victims in order to discharge them from the service — a common occurrence, according to activists, such as Anu Bhagwati of the Women in Service Action Network, a human rights group.
Her group filed a lawsuit in December against the Veterans Administration, accusing it of discriminatory practices in the way it handles claims for benefits for people who say they have been sexually assaulted on the service.
Nine separate bills have been introduced in Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing a series of corrections.
In 2010, there were 3,158 reported sexual assaults, according to the Office for the Prevention of Sexual Assault and Department of Defense Response.
However, the assaults are notably underreported, and by the Pentagon’s own estimates, they amount to about 13.5 percent of the 19,000 estimated incidents that occurred that year.
The report, released in March, also examines prosecution rates: in 2010, 20 percent of reported cases in the military went to trial — half as many as in the civilian justice system.
The plaintiffs in Burke’s case describe their attacks as just the first in a series of traumas.
In Lyman’s case, he reported the alleged rape to military police less than an hour after it happened.
That night, he says, he was asked to recount the details of his rape 11 different times to a crowd of police officers, doctors, and commanders.
She underwent a rape kit, and the blood of her assailant — from a cut on her arm — was found on her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a hearing before a judge, during which he was asked about having sex with his boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six people testified as personality witnesses on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted.
“I remember the day the verdict was read,” Lyman says.
"I thought I was going to go to work - I found myself screaming from the living room."
"I was put in the psychiatry unit, and when I got out, I remember I said to my commanding officer, 'That wasn't your judgment. That was my judgment.'
Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder, which made her unfit for service.
In January 2010 she was discharged from service on less-than-honorable terms, preventing her from receiving any benefits.
As for whether the case brought by Lyman and his fellow plaintiffs continues, it’s a very remote possibility, says John Turley, a law professor at George Washington Law School.
However, he notes, “In my opinion, they should be able to move on.”
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first published.
I have been a constant critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The military is decades behind because it does not have the same incentive and deterrence that accountability poses.
“The odds are strongly against them... but it’s important for them to try.”
These things only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing doesn’t go her way, Burke, plaintiffs’ attorney, will queue her other hundreds of plaintiffs for future cases.
“We will continue to fight the army on this issue until reform takes place,” he says.
Or until we die, whichever comes first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers Are Studying You on Facebook
Before he became the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just another guy airing his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to carrying out a massacre in Norway in July that left 77 people dead, faced his first public court hearing.
While Breivik may have acted alone, he was far from alone in cyberspace: He had spent most of the time leading up to his attack in front of his computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social media.
After this summer’s tragedy, investigators wanted to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy - just log in to Facebook.
“We realized it wasn’t that hard to get to them,” says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recently published report on European digital populism by the British think tank DEMOS.
Facebook’s cache of personal information is so encyclopedic, Bartlett says, that researchers could simply use the advertising tool to determine their desired demographic characteristics with scientific precision — the way marketers have been using it for years.
Bartlett’s team found half a million fans of right-wing groups across Europe and then directed them to ads, but instead of linking them to a new band or diet product, the ads invited users to complete a survey that asked about their educational level, attitudes toward violence, and optimism about their own future.
By arriving via Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to study more than 10,000 followers from 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries — all without leaving office.
“It’s a whole new way of doing research,” Bartlett says.
Some of the results aren’t entirely surprising: Online supporters of right-wing groups tend to be young, male and angry about immigration.
However, in a kind of twist, “those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who stay behind the computer screen.”
The work of DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new and important tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centers, medical researchers, and political scientists are using the site to study everything from health problems to social trends as expressed in “likes,” messages on walls, and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content a day, Facebook’s “data supernova” is driving a research boom, boosting the number of academic papers with the site’s name in the title to nearly 800% over the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you couldn’t get close to with a folder on the street.
"Before, when you were trying to poll people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
“You’d have to go through the game, and they’d never allow you access,” Bartlett says.
"Facebook eliminates all that - you go to them directly."
Others say the site could provide a way to identify and address health-social issues.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and colleagues found that college students who talked about their drunken exploits on Facebook had a significantly higher risk of drinking problems than students who remained silent about the issue.
Moreno suggests that fellow students, such as residential counselors, could control the site and step in to help a student post too many status updates with their binge drinking.
“You can’t treat a problem if you can’t diagnose it,” said Dimitri Christakis, Moreno’s co-author and director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior, and Development at the Seattle Institute for Children’s Research.
“We’ve found a way to identify at-risk children who might not otherwise be diagnosed.”
Facebook is also constantly “punching” its own population for data.
The site’s Data Team has compiled statistics on the state of the relationship and Valentine’s Day, the expectation of voter turnout midway through the 2010 legislative period, and an index of National Happiness (primarily using the information that can be accessed – long-time digital freedom advocates who argue that the site should make its wealth of data available to others for research).
However, Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not – the sacrifice of being able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away is allowing the site to mine your personal information.
But what happens when Facebook users become part of a survey they don’t even know about?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect your data offline, online is an open bar for everyone.
“I don’t think a lot of users have even thought about the fact that a researcher might be looking at their profiles,” says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, about a 2006 study he conducted with public Facebook walls of students.
"As far as they were concerned, it was only between them and their friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research topic is being completely honest.
On Facebook, it’s impossible to know that some of a user’s profile information and wall posts are true.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things,” Selwyn says.
That’s why, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn believes that a paperweight and a pen are still the best research tools anyone can use.
“There’s no substitute for going into the real world and talking to real people,” he says.
“Social research is supposed to be about the social – and a lot of the social still happens offline.”
Cold and Inhuman: Anders Behring Breivik Makes His First Public Appearance in Court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to masterminding the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has described himself as a “resistance” fighter during his first public appearance in Oslo court.
“I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and in the Knights Templar of Norway,” he told a packed room of 500 people.
“I oppose the court because it was mandated by organizations that support the ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism.”
"I acknowledge the facts, but I do not plead guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during that monologue, because he “didn’t want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this audience as a platform for him to express his views.”
For the same reason he refused to allow Breivik, who brought a written speech in advance, to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered police to hold Breivik in custody for 12 more weeks, barred him from the media for four weeks, and said authorities would have to have strict control over all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came hoping to look Breivik in the eye, others to confirm that he is locked up.
All attended with the aim of moving towards the conclusion.
“I thought it looked cold and inhumane,” one Utoya survivor told Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
"It was uncomfortable, but for me it was a step forward after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the hearing and looked journalists and survivors in the eye as he walked in and out of the building.
Despite Breivik’s bizarre notion of being part of a larger “resistance” movement, the judge determined he is not a mentally ill man, and said there is no evidence he acted with accomplices.
Some may find it comforting that the July 22 attacks appear to be the work of an extremist rather than a group of radicals.
But that doesn’t automatically ease the pain and confusion that an entire nation still feels.
“I wish it looked like a monster, but it doesn’t,” said a relative of one victim.
"It would be a lot easier if it looked like it."
7 Lessons from Steve Jobs’ Lost Interview Shown at a Theater This Week
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, there were some who compared him to Henry Ford - distinguishing the genius of technology as the Great Modern Inventor.
But what Apple fans might find most revealing, in a recently rediscovered interview with Jobs that has been dusted off in advance of a series of special screenings in major markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood about business processes and product workflows.
He was certainly a self-recognized designer, dreamer, and hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer and a flowchart junki — a man who believed that many executives suffered “a disease that consists of thinking that a great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] there is a tremendous amount of work between a great idea and a great product.”
In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the television series The Triumph of the Nerds about the dawn of the personal computer, and sat for more than an hour with Jobs for an extensive and rare conversation.
By that time it had been barely 10 years since Jobs had been forced out of Apple, and he was already hard at work on his new computer company NeXT, waiting for popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small portion of Cringely’s interview was used on Nerds, he said the originals of the interview disappeared during their transport.
It was only after Jobs' death that a full VHS copy was discovered in the director's garage.
This slightly re-edited footage is the basis for Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, a 68-minute film that hits Landmark theaters on Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known for hating in-depth interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly willing to expose his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And very thoughtful.
At four different points throughout the interview, there are great silences between the questions and the answers – from 10 to 15 seconds of reflections, where Jobs is clearly weighing his thoughts, looking for precision.
There are also times when Jobs’ perfectionism comes to the surface, where he seems impatient because of Cringely’s questions, pushing him to go faster toward the topics or arguments of greater importance.
Filmed before the Pixar era, the iPod or the iPhone, there’s something strangely prophetic about The Lost Interview, when Jobs evaluates what he sees other companies doing right and wrong, and offers his own vision of the future of computing.
It’s one thing to read posthumous evaluations of Jobs’ career, but there’s something raw and inspiring about the Jobs we see here, the eager dreamer on the verge of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and should be.
Not long after I explained everything in detail here, it went and did.
A quick summary of seven notable sequences from The Lost Interview:
On how he learned to run a business:
“Over the years in the business, I’d always ask, ‘Why do you do things?’ and the answers they invariably give you are, ‘Oh, that’s just the way it’s done.’
No one knows why he does what he does, in business no one thinks about things very deeply.
That's what I found.
Jobs goes into detail about his efforts to simplify Apple’s accounting.
Bewildered by the way costs were recorded – often starting with a “standard cost” that was done by the eye of a good cover, and then adjusted with a “variable” – he developed an automated factory that ensured that they could determine commercial costs in detail.
On the Pope’s joke:
Jobs narrates the "Blue Box" he built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to effectively hack the phone company and make free long distance calls.
It has been written extensively about the device, but Jobs’ euphoria here in describing the Blue Box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box by using a payphone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another, while creating a loop with as many satellites as possible.
“We were wrapping things around the world a half-dozen times and yelling through the pay phone and coming back a minute later to the pay phone next door,” Jobs says with a chuckle.
“We were young and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that could control billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world.”
The two of us, we didn’t know much, but we could build a little thing that could control a giant thing – it was an incredible lesson, and I don’t think Apple would have ever existed without it.
Jobs goes on to describe a glorious prank he and Wozniak nearly abandoned, calling the Vatican through the Blue Box in the middle of the night and requesting to speak to the Pope, while doing his best imitation of Henry Kissinger.
As several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak with the American diplomat, the two burst into laughter just before the pope himself was awakened to go answer the phone.
About falling in love with technology (and selling over the phone with Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, hunting for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he looked up Bill Hewlett in the phone book and made him a call.
Shortly after their 20-minute phone conversation, Jobs landed a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
“That was a remarkable influence on me, it was the only company I had seen at that age and shaped my vision of what a company was and how well they treated their employees.”
Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever made."
It was as big as a suitcase, it had a small cathode-ray tube screen, and I fell in love with it.
I would get a ride to HP as a teenager and waste time with that machine and write programs for it.
On Improvising Innovation:
At various points in the interview, Jobs talks about inventing new products on the fly.
Early in his career, as he was selling a handful of motherboards, he was asked by a customer if he could assemble the whole equipment.
Working with just 30 days of credit, I had to figure out the assembly and delivery of the finished devices.
Later, while at Apple, he recalls the struggles he faced in developing a computer mouse:
“I remember having dramatic arguments ... I was yelling that it would take five years [to create a mouse that would cost $300], and I got fed up and went out and found a designer.
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $15 and that was totally reliable.
On large companies losing strength:
Long before he led Apple’s renaissance, Jobs prophetically foresaw how many industry leaders would stumble upon his vision, and lose control of their market share.
"Say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make better photocopiers and printers, so what?"
You have the monopoly of market share, so the company is no more successful.
Sales and marketing departments increase success, so it is these kinds of people who end up running the companies and the people in charge of the products are expelled from the forum for decision-making.
The genius of the products that led to that monopoly position is rotted away by people who don’t have the notion of good products vs. bad products – the knowledge of the necessary craft.
This is what happened at Xerox.
Xerox could have taken over the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times its size, it could have been the Microsoft of the 90s...
They took the defeat of the victory.
On innovation as artistic expression:
“There’s a tremendous amount of work between a great idea and a great product... as the great idea evolves, changes and grows.”
You learn a lot about the subtleties of it.
There are sacrifices you have to make – some things you can’t make electrons do, glass does, robots do, factories do.
You have to keep 5000 things in your brain - these concepts - adjust them all at once...
In the end it all comes down to taste - it stoops to trying to expose you to the best that a team of humans has done, and then trying to adapt those things to what you're doing.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We’ve never been embarrassed about stealing great ideas.
What partly made the Macintosh great was that the people who were working on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who happened to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If it weren’t for computer science, I might be doing wonderful things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas have dinner with healthcare law rivals as court accepts case
On the day that the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to consider the politically contentious question of whether they would accept President Obama’s health care challenge, two of his justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were treated at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will present the case to the high court.
The occasion was last Thursday, when the nine judges met in a preliminary hearing to thoroughly study the requests for review.
One of the cases in question was a lawsuit filed by 26 states challenging total health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a rallying cry for conservative activists across the country.
The justices agreed to allow the lawsuit to proceed, and in fact a historic 5.5-hour plea is expected by March, and the outcome is likely to further cloud the 2012 presidential race, which will be in full swing by the time the court’s decision is known.
The lawyer who will appear in court and argue that the law should be scrapped will likely be Paul Clement, who served as U.S. Attorney General during the George W. Bush administration.
Clement’s law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a group that has long been dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that defied the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the litigation.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel hours after the court’s preliminary hearing on the case.
Among the attendees were, among others, Mitch McConnell, the top Republican in the Senate and an outspoken opponent of the health care law.
The special guests at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
It’s nothing new: The two judges have been attending Federalist Society events for years.
And it’s not something that conflicts with ethical standards.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct governing the actions of lower federal judges.
If they were not, it could be said that they would fall under Canon Code 4C, which says, “A judge may attend events to raise funds from law-related and other organizations, although the judge may not be a speaker, a guest of honor, or appear on the program of such an event.”
However, Scalia and Thomas’s absolute proximity to two of the law firms in the case, as well as a company with a huge financial interest, was enough to alarm ethics activists in the government.
“This stunning breach of ethics and indifference to the code runs counter to the demands of several magistrates that the court abide by the same rules that apply to all federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, the president of Common Cause.
“The judges were treated to a gala fundraiser with lawyers who have cases pending before the court.”
Their appearance and assistance in raising funds for this event undermines any demand for impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest in critics who say they too easily mix the court’s activity with the agenda pushed by groups like the Federalist Society.
And Thomas’s wife, Ginni, is a prominent conservative activist.
On the other hand, conservatives argue that it is magistrate Elena Kagan who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan worked as the Obama administration’s attorney general when the first legal challenges to the law were filed in the court of first instance.
Her critics have pushed for Kagan to refrain from watching the case, saying she was too involved in upholding the law to now be impartial.
Kagan has given no indication that he will do so.
Boeing Receives Record $18 Billion Order
Emirates is ordering 50 Boeing 777 twin-aisle aircraft, with an option for 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner aircraft to Oman Air, an operation valued at more than $1 billion.
It is rarely news when a company gets an order for 50 units of its product.
But it’s a big deal when the company is aircraft maker Boeing Co. and the selling price for the 50 planes amounts to a record $18 billion.
It is as large as the place from which Boeing received the order: the Middle East, a growing gold mine for future aircraft orders.
In a study released Monday, the Chicago-based company estimates that over the next 20 years airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion.
Boeing announced over the weekend its largest ever order for commercial jets for their dollar value – 50 double-aisle Boeing 777 jets.
The successful order came from Emirates airline in Dubai.
The airline also has an option to buy 20 more aircraft, which would bring the total sale price to $26 billion, Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Airshow.
Then, on Monday, Boeing said Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which boasts spectacular fuel savings and passenger services.
The selling price for six of them is more than a billion dollars.
"This clearly has a huge positive effect for Boeing," Morningstar analyst Neal Dihora said.
"The quality of these particular customers is very strong."
Many Middle Eastern airlines are owned by their oil-producing nations.
Therefore, not only do they have the money to pay for the planes, but an increase in fuel prices - usually harmful to airlines, because it is one of the biggest costs - is not so harmful, because the country is making money with the increase in the price of oil.
That’s important because they’re less likely than other airlines to cancel or delay flight orders when fuel prices rise, Dihora said.
“They have natural protection,” he said.
The Emirates order solidifies Boeing’s leadership in the widebody market and helps keep its competitor Airbus SAS’s attempt to invade its domain with the A350 passenger jet at bay.
Boeing’s victory at the air show comes four months after Airbus said it was delaying the debut of the larger A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
It delayed the debut to add more momentum after customers demanded an increase in payload and range.
Boeing Co shares rose 1.5 percent to $67.94.
The sister of Mexico’s president, apparently defeated in the Michoacán vote
Luisa Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n says drug traffickers helped her PRI opponent, Fausto Vallejo, in the governor’s race.
President Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n's sister appears to have lost her candidacy for governor of Michoacán during the violent state's elections, and she said Monday that drug traffickers helped tilt the race in favor of one of her opponents.
Preliminary results gave the lead in the race for governor of the western state to Fausto Vallejo, of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process and, especially yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoacán, but for the entire country," Luisa Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n said in a radio interview a day after Sunday's vote.
“They threatened our candidates, our election workers... They seized the polls, set up barricades... and ordered people to vote” for the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.
However, it is the staging of a comeback, and the victory in Michoacán is an important step in that effort.
The PRI is hoping to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo appears to have narrowly outpaced Calderon, who had led the polls before the election.
Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, a candidate from his brother’s conservative National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the leftist candidate for the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who currently holds the governorship, came in third, a major defeat for the divided and unfortunate left ahead of the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the preliminary results.
Vallejo, a former mayor of the state capital of Morelia, denied links to drug trafficking and urged the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin, and methamphetamines.
It is the home state of President Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, and he chose Michoacán to launch a targeted military offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
However, the violence has persisted.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the elections while campaigning for Luisa Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, and numerous candidates abandoned local candidacies out of fear.
Although for the PRI, unpleasant as the elections in Michoacán seem, a victory will help boost the party.
The man who is supposed to represent the PRI in the presidential election, Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said: “I think this victory should be very encouraging, for next year.”
ADB urges Asia to help bail out eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has called on India and China to prepare to help rescue the eurozone from its sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term recession that would impede the growth of Asian economies.
Rajat Nag, director general of the Manila-based Asian Development Bank, said the world’s two fastest-growing major economies had to “do everything possible” to accelerate the economic bloc’s recovery either through the International Monetary Fund or directly through bilateral agreements.
He warned against the BRIC [Brazil, Russia, India, China] countries looking at Europe’s difficulties in an “impartial” way and said that Asia’s financial assistance along with European leadership and resources would help avert a long-term crisis in the global economy.
"We're all in this together."
“So anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is helpful,” he told the Financial Times in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
“Asia may be protected to some extent, but it cannot be immune.”
“So if China and India can help, by all means.”
The European monetary union has been severely undermined by a sovereign debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy’s borrowing costs have skyrocketed dangerously and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The current sovereign debt crisis in Europe has raised fears it could push the global economy into recession and has prompted calls for major emerging economies to band together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channelled through the IMF, but said that bilateral assistance – such as the purchase of bonds from the EU’s bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Fund – offered greater bargaining power for Europe’s Asian partners.
Anand Sharma, India’s trade minister, said that “India will do everything possible” to help the eurozone as its own economy was now suffering from falling exports and depleting inflows of foreign capital.
“No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent,” he said.
“We have monumental challenges and we have to maintain a high level of growth.”
“It’s not an option, it’s an imperative, because where do we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women?”
Others argue that developing economies like India have no responsibility to help wealthy Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the US, said it would be politically very difficult to sell aid to Europe for India’s 1.2 billion people, of whom up to 800 million live on about $2 a day or less.
“At some point they will realize that Greeks retire at the age of 50 and go on vacation to the beaches and that won’t go down well,” he said.
Lee Howell, managing director of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India’s reserves should be used to keep the numerous, well-paid Greek public sector workers in jobs at poorly run, loss-making companies like the railways.
Mr Nag said the eurozone crisis threatened to have "significant knock-on effects" across Asia.
The Asian Development Bank’s forecast of 7.5 percent economic growth in Asia for 2011/12 now faces “downside risks” due to the threat from Europe.
He said vulnerable emerging markets needed to make “contingency plans” to protect themselves from a crisis and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Serious Pentagon warnings about possible defense cuts
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta warmed Congress on Monday, warning that the looming automatic budget cuts could undermine national security and provoke a financial chain reaction from the halls of the Pentagon, to the battlefields of Afghanistan, to civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon is already digesting the $450 billion in reductions over the next decade, but now fears an additional $600 billion or more reduction in cuts that may be imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
“The impact of these cuts would be devastating to the department,” Panetta said in a letter to Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.
He said Congress’ failure to reach agreement on the budget and its consequence, the so-called “kidnapping,” would result in 23 percent global reductions and a halt to many new projects.
“Such a large cut, applied in this indiscriminate manner, would make most of our naval and construction projects unexecutable — you can’t buy three-quarters of a ship or a building — and seriously damage other modernization efforts,” Panetta wrote to senators.
“We would also be forced to remove many of our civilian officials involuntarily and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, it is almost certain that we would have to fire civilians in order to meet the target.”
“These changes would break faith with those who maintain our military and seriously damage goodwill.”
The cuts would eventually reach combat troops, Panetta said.
“While wartime funding in the Overseas Contingency Operations accounts is not directly affected by the hijacking, wartime efforts would be negatively affected by severe disruptions in base budgets,” Panetta warned.
“The hiring of personnel would be reduced, which would lead to delays in contracts and oversight of the contract that supports the war.”
“Payroll staff would be reduced, leading to delays in payments to suppliers in wartime, and legal and political support would be disrupted.”
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for information about the possible impact of the automatic cuts on the Department of Defense.
“The consequence of a hijacking at the Department of Defense would cause a rapid decline of the United States as the world’s leading military power.”
“We are firmly against this draconian action,” the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon when they released Panetta’s letter.
“This is not a result that we can live with, and it is certainly not one that we should impose on ourselves.”
“The kidnapping is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and must not be allowed to occur.”
Whether Panetta’s letter and recent warnings from senators will increase pressure for a budget commitment or intensify calls to exempt the Pentagon from the cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly outspoken about the potential cuts, even though he came to a job at the top of the Pentagon with years of experience budgeting in Congress and the White House and knowing that he faced tough decisions.
At a news conference last week, the secretary of defense painted a grim picture of what might lie ahead — an army with a shell, but not a core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without bullets."
“It’s an air wing without enough trained pilots.”
“It’s a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers to accomplish the mission,” Panetta said in his opening remarks at the Pentagon.
“It is a force that suffers from low morale, poor preparation and is not able to keep up with potential adversaries.”
"Indeed, it invites aggression..."
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta spells out new details of how the reductions “generate significant operational risks: delayed response time to crises, conflicts and disasters; severely limits our ability to be previously deployed and engaged around the world; and poses an unacceptable risk in future combat operations.”
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects could face the axe, including those already being tested and some only in the early stages of planning.
That list includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter fighter jet, a planned new bomber, the next-generation ballistic submarine, the new littoral combat ship and the new land-based combat vehicle that the Army and Navy need to replace, the humvee.
Stopping further development and testing of the F35 could generate some $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say it is the vital next step in improving and addressing potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to spot a lie
A look at the most recent headlines tells us how serious and pervasive deception and lying are in daily life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging accusations of sexual harassment with several women; each side accuses the other of lying.
Pennsylvania State University administrators have been charged with perjury for allegedly hiding reports that a retired soccer coach was sexually assaulting children.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was “caught” with an open microphone asserting to US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lying has destroyed careers and convulsed countries.
The New York congressman and Internet exhibitionist, Anthony Weiner, made a fool of himself with his denials quickly refuted by the irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with campaign finance violations related to the cover-up of an extramarital affair.
And, again, no one who lived it will ever forget the media circus unleashed by President Bill Clinton by lying during his second term about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Legends about cheating on school and college exams are widespread.
There have been cases where teachers have given test answers to students in order to be better seen in their performance evaluations.
Mentors who should be teaching otherwise are sending the message that lying and cheating are acceptable.
How deceptive are we?
On any given day, studies show that they can lie to you anywhere from 10 to 200 times.
That's for sure, a lot of those lies are godly lies.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of getting to know each other.
Detecting lies, or “locating lies,” is an essential skill that we should all acquire, for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a board game similar to, for example, Charada, where the goal is to exclaim: "I have you", deception detection is a branch of serious knowledge based on scientific data obtained during the last six decades in prestigious universities that carried out in-depth research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the old myths about lying have been refuted.
Liars do look into the eyes.
They do not always stutter, babble, blush, or fidget.
Nor can it be concluded that liars are difficult to detect or unmask.
A trained lie detector can come to the truth by learning about the structure of the statement, microfacial expressions, question formation, and timing.
I spent several years probing scientific discoveries about deception in the vast and ever-emerging body of knowledge, and it was clear that deception detection is a modern technique that is easy to learn and helps you navigate our complex world – especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviewing, or managing negotiations.
Good liars have the ability to read well to others, making them feel at ease, managing their own emotions and intuitively feeling how others perceive them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more than introverts, that men tell more "self-oriented lies," while women tell more "other-oriented" lies -- usually to protect someone's feelings -- than married people lie to their partners less frequently than non-married people (but the lies they often tell tend to be "huge").
We also know that if you are perceived as an evildoer, others will feel less guilty about lying to you.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First, observe the habitual behavior of the subject.
This is called "creating a baseline."
Helps provide benchmarks to measure changes later.
Observe the subject’s posture, laughter, and vocal characteristic.
It’s best to know if someone normally hits your foot all the time so you don’t make unfair accusations when you see your feet hitting in the middle of the meeting.
Next, look for misleading, verbal, and nonverbal behavior groups.
Consider these behavior groups as red flags, not evidence of deception.
Deceiving people can freeze their upper body by trying to remember their history, they can point their feet at the door, lean toward an exit, change their posture significantly, or exhibit “post-interview relief” — that exaggerated sigh of relief and change of posture once all the tough questions are over.
Interrogators often falsely pretend that the interview is over just to seek that post-interview relief.
Also pay attention to the subject’s vocabulary.
Scott Peterson screwed up to the bottom and used the past tense while claiming his murdered wife was alive, launching a nationwide search for her.
People who cheat may also use distancing language: "I did not have sex with that woman... Miss Lewinsky" or repeat a difficult question in its entirety.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone may use a lot of "restrictive language" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to tell the truth... as far as I know... as far as I understand."
This makes the response a perception rather than a fact and is often a red flag.
There is no magic formula for detecting lies, but developing skills for discovering deception is possible.
These skills will improve anyone’s chances to avoid being victimized by scam artists in their professional and personal lives.
Controversial pipeline plan diverted after threat of U.S. delay in approval
Days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of a planned pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- angering unions while appeasing environmentalists -- the company seeking to build the pipeline says it is willing to redirect the project to get it back on track.
TransCanada said Monday night it will move the planned pipeline out of the ecologically sensitive Sandhills area in Nebraska, and is confident the project will win approval.
The company announced the decision at a news conference at the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada executive Alex Pourbax says the company remains confident the pipeline will eventually be approved, albeit on a different route.
This follows last week’s announcement by the State Department that they would delay the decision on a federal permit for the project until new potential routes are considered that bypass the Sandhills areas of Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, a vast groundwater supply.
“This is a real path of progress,” Rep. Lee Terry, R-Nebraska, told Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the State Department is likely to set aside any decision until 2013, after next year’s election, though officials denied the policy was involved in the decision.
Obama, in a statement written last week, described the decision as the State Department’s request, and expressed his full support for them.
The 1,700-kilometer pipeline would stretch from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would bring 700,000 barrels a day from the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas.
For this, it would be necessary to cross six states.
It is hated by environmentalists, but loved by working groups, which have bet on the estimate of 20,000 jobs linked to the pipeline.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed to the plan are weighing legislation to force a move away from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala aquifer, the largest source of drinking water and irrigation.
The State Department’s current environmental impact study found that the project posed only limited adverse environmental impacts, but the energy industry source said the department’s inspector general has ordered an independent test of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is whether TransCanada-hired lobbyist Paul Elliot, who was Hillary Clinton’s campaign adviser in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a firm that was hired to run the original studio was an inappropriate choice because it was tied to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly causing a child to vomit in fear
A New York family claims that disco diva Patti LaBelle behaved like crazy in the lobby of their Manhattan building, terrifying her young daughter to the point that she vomited in fear.
The "Lady Marmalade" singer's tirade scared 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disturbances" and "increased her fear of strangers," her family says in Manhattan Supreme Court.
It was Nov. 10 last year when stagehand Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were preparing to go on a family trip.
As Kevin Monk took the car, Roseanna Monk came down to the lobby of the Riverside Boulevard building, with her luggage, carrying Genevieve.
Roseanna Monk said she stood near the door and put her daughter on the floor for a moment.
“Somebody came up behind me and said, ‘You know what your daughter is doing?’ I said ‘yes’ and I went to get her,” she said.
LaBelle angrily admonished the pregnant woman.
"He said in an aggressive tone, 'I shouldn't have left your daughter near the door,'" Roseanna Monk said.
"I said, 'I have no interest in what you say or think.'
He got angry and started using bad words - the word C and the word J out loud...
I had a bottle of water and he started to throw the water out of the bottle on me."
He said Genevieve got hysterical.
"I said to this woman, 'Look what you've done to my daughter,'" the girl's mother said.
LaBelle pounced on the mother -- who was still holding Genevieve -- and had to be restrained by her surroundings and retreated to a waiting car, Roseanna Monk said.
The little girl was crying so hard that she vomited, he added.
The family later sent a note apologizing to LaBelle, but got no response.
LaBelle’s lawyer and representatives did not return calls to comment on what happened.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, but the family’s attorney, Sam Davis, said he took the case for free and that the family plans to donate all the money it gets to a cancer children’s support association.
“The purpose is to hold Patti LaBelle accountable for her conduct,” Davis said.
“That kind of behavior is completely unacceptable, especially when it’s directed at a kindergarten teacher carrying an 18-month-old child in her arms.”
Climate Adversity Curbing the Economy
During the first year of Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdez’s administration, unemployment and informality increased in Sinaloa, foreign investment fell and the economy contracted.
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of the government of Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdez, self-called change, which generated great expectations regarding the progress in the economy, but given the climatic adversity at the beginning of the year, there is no growth, instead there is a deterioration in the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures of February, in addition to causing millionaire losses for the agricultural sector, limited the possibilities of the state economy to grow, caused a contraction of the overall economic activity of 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, mainly justified by the historical fall of 31.16 percent in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of the other economic sectors.
According to the report of frost damage, issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, 582,835 hectares were damaged, of which 78.03 percent suffered total damage and the remaining 21.07 percent had partial damage, the main crops damaged were vegetables, corn and chickpeas.
The fall in economic activity has generated, until November, a constant increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography the state unemployment rate during the first three quarters of the year was observed an accelerated growth, since while from January to March 55,053 Sinaloan people were unemployed19, with a rate of 4.53 percent of the economically active population, for the second quarter the rate went from one thousand to six thousand.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, for the economist Gerardo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly, depending on the actions that have been carried out since public policy.
“What we are seeing is a growth in unemployment that has to do with several factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market due to the effects of a restriction of resources by the legislation that was passed in Congress to combat money laundering, since for people who grab dollars illegally it is not easy for them to work, invest them and use them in something,” he said.
Detained migration
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Cervantes pointed out that in the increase in unemployment there is also a demographic factor.
“The number of people leaving the state in search of work abroad in the United States has been restricted, first because of the difficulties to enter, and second because entering they also have many difficulties to find work, those people are staying and are demanding sources of work here in the state, which causes unemployment to rise,” he said.
Informality
The analysis of the labor market in Sinaloa is aggravated by considering the high level of informality that predominates among working conditions, according to the INEGI, 60.38 percent of the employed population in the state works without being contributing as a worker before any social security institution.
In addition to unemployment and informality, another of the labor lags of the state are low wages, the entity has the lowest salaries in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Ministry of Labor and Social Security.
The average monthly income of Sinaloa workers was, until September, 5,352 pesos, well below the national average, located at 7,375 pesos.
FDI contraction
In addition to the fall in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, during 2011 there was the largest decrease in Foreign Direct Investment in the last 10 years, according to the Ministry of Economy from January to June the state FDI totaled 630,697 dollars, which represents a fall of 87.74 percent compared to the 5,143,312 dollars registered during the same period of the previous year.
For its part, the Ministry of Economic Development of the State Government accounts for a total investment of 17.28 billion pesos in the year, mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.
The debt
Faced with the scenario of economic contraction, the state government asked the state congress in July for the approval of a credit for 3 billion pesos, the same that would be allocated to investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, in order to reactivate the economy, the approval of the local congress was for an amount of 2.6 billion pesos, and until November they have not observed the benefits of indebtedness in any sector of the economy.
Reactions
For representatives of the business sector, the first year of Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdés’s government shows a lack of government management capacity.
Miguel Loredo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, president of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, said that during 2011 there was a lack of harmonization of the wills of the different sectors, including the state government itself.
"The performance of the economy in Sinaloa during this year has been really very poor, we must work intensely to recover the ground we lost in this year, in 2012 we have to redouble efforts, the effort of all failed to align and above all the good and synchronized progress of this new government team, we hope that next year will be much better," he said.
Economic Slowness
Loredo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez said that events such as the frosts of the beginning of the year stopped the state economy and restricted its performance and growth.
"The low economic flow is the product of several events, including frost, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not turn fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows an acceptable level of flow in processes, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we are closing well below the expectations we had," he said.
Redefining Vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Employers Confederation of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, he said that it is necessary to prosecute the state towards productive activities of greater dynamism.
“In general terms we have observed that work has been done, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program in which the vocation and economic direction of the state is redefined, because it is important that the full potential of the material and human resource that Sinaloa has is detonated,” he said.
Work to be done
The president of Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that better directs the Government’s efforts.
"In general terms I would say that the government has been striving to give good results in different areas, in terms of economic development there are some advances but it is important that a long-term program is developed," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in its way of conducting public policy.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the government is being more inclusive, I can say that there is work done and I think the government is aware that there is work to be done," he said.
He is charged with 8 kg of marijuana.
A neighbor of Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and a 100-day fine for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Office of the Attorney General of the Republic reported that the narcomenudista sentenced is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for the crime against health, in its variant of possession of marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to the file AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by elements of the Mexican Army on June 7, 2010, in a surveillance operation on Cipriano Valdez Street, in front of post 80, in the town of El Castillo, Navolato.
The narcomenudista was circulating in a pick-up truck, white, where he carried a black bag in the box of the vehicle and in the seat of the co-driver a small backpack, where the military found eight kilograms 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the insured was placed at the disposal of the Second District Judge and the sentenced person remains interned in the Center for the Execution of the Legal Consequences of the Crime.
Contributions are due for works
The social works contemplated in programs such as Habitat, Rescue of Public Spaces and 3x1 for migrants are at risk of not being completed or of having serious delays due to the lack of economic resources, said Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Miranda.
The director of Municipal Social Development indicated that although so far the work programs have advanced, they are at risk because the State Government has not complied with the contributions that correspond to it, which add up to a resource of more than 11 million pesos in the three programs.
He pointed out that in total the investment in these three programs is almost 50 million pesos, of which the State corresponds to 25 percent and that so far only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for the works, so the possible delay in the conclusion of these is made effective.
"They are almost 12 million what they have to contribute and although the year is about to end they have not given us a fifth, when since July they should have given us a part," he said, "we have started the works and are very advanced, but we need the money."
He mentioned that last year, in the administration of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the State did not comply with the contributions that corresponded to them, so at the beginning of the administration the Municipality had to request a credit to cover the more than 7 million that the state administration did not contribute on that occasion.
"It happened to us in the previous six-year period because the State did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programs continued to walk, and this year we had to get the resources to be able to access these programs to cover what the State left pending," he said.
Although there is the commitment of the state authorities to comply with the delivery of these resources, he said that the request has been made to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to hasten the efforts so that the percentages that correspond to them arrive as soon as possible.
"It's almost 12 million what they have to contribute and even though the year is coming to an end they haven't given us a fifth."
Cut validates "analog blackout" in Mexico in 2015
Replacing analog with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional controversies that brought the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the presidential decree that advances the so-called "analog blackout" from 2021 to 2015, by not meeting the eight votes necessary to invalidate it.
A minority of four ministers, including the president of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n did not exceed in his powers when issuing the decree detailing the actions to be taken to make the transition to digital terrestrial television.
With that result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic, was dismissed for not reaching the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and it remains in force.
The draft sentence, prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed declaring the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of radio and television matters is a faculty reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and reservation of law.
Only Zald<0xC3><0xAD>var, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero themselves voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional controversies to challenge the decree, and by admitting the demands, the minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions in it arranged for the digital transition.
The plenary of ministers also decided to dismiss the demand filed by the Chamber of Deputies, without entering into the discussion of the project, also in charge of the minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the minister president said he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the federal executive cannot structure through general rules the measures so that the public administration is prepared.
"I also do not consider that doing so would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," and recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector correspond to the Federal Executive, who has a constitutional mandate, the rectory of the State.
Replacing analog with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years, resulting in better use of the radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
To postpone the change, he said, would be to postpone the benefits of digitization, which involves a decision in the public interest, which does not have only a technical dimension, "because it covers economic, social, political and national security issues."
These issues, he stressed, "require the operation of the entire established system, in accordance with the principle of economic governance of the State, encompasses a group of powers that the Constitution leads to the power of the State Executive."
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the digital transition, and have done so through the Executive, despite having highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, in issuing the contested decree, which invades in some way the sphere of competence of the Congress, since it is providing in the administrative sphere the observance of the laws issued by the Legislature, he assured.
They analyze the possibility of a count "vote by vote" in Michoacán
According to the data released by the PREP, the difference between first and second place in the election of governor is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6,74 total minutes.
The possibility of counting "vote by vote" is a reality with regard to the electoral process this year in Michoacán, where according to the data released by the Preliminary Electoral Results Program (PREP) the difference between first and second place in the election of governor is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6,74 total minutes.
In this regard, the president of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that just a few days ago, on November 9, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines in order to harmonize local rules with federal reform in electoral matters.
As will be recalled, Michoacán did not approve its Political Constitution or its State Electoral Code or its Electoral Justice Law, since the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the end of the legal deadline so that they could enter into force in the current electoral process and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted their publication within the deadlines provided for in the Law on the Official State Gazette, with the argument that he had some objections.
On November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local Legislative Power and qualified as "invalid and illegal" the vote of the state president to constitutional reforms, since he has no right to "sanction or veto them".
Interviewed about the possibility of "vote by vote", Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal explained that thanks to the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of the IEM it will be possible to carry out partial and total counts of the vote by the local electoral body.
In this way, the partial counting of votes, of one or more electoral packages, may occur in the event that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no counting and counting record in the file of the box or does not work in the possession of the president of the same; or, when there are errors or obvious alterations of the minutes.
In addition, the total count of the vote received in all the boxes of the election may be made when there is an indication that the difference between the alleged winner of the election in question and the one who obtained the second place in the vote, is equal to or less than one percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is the express request of the representative of the party and / or coalition that nominated the second of the candidates indicated.
The total count of the vote may also be made if at the end of the ordinary calculation it is established that the difference between the allegedly winning candidate and the second-placed candidate is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that there is the express request of the representative of the political party whose candidate was in second place, in which case the electoral packages that have been partially counted will be excluded.
It is worth mentioning that in this situation is the election of Morelia, where according to the PREP the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 percent, although not counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total minutes.
His Last Will
His ashes will be scattered in the mountains of Zapalinamé, confirms the family.
The remains of pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés arrived in Saltillo, his hometown, this Sunday night, during Monday there were reconnaissances and a requiem mass.
According to his relatives, the lieutenant colonel’s last wish was that his ashes be scattered in the Zapalinamé mountain range.
After receiving a tribute from the side of the other people who died in the accident, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital of Coahuila aboard an aircraft of the Mexican Air Force, the closest people attended the ceremony on the Campo Marte.

Some didn’t believe it because they said he was even dizzy in the truck; however, he always sought to fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a very good person, "he was only in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, like the occasion when he brought Martha Sahag<0xC3><0xBA>n to Saltillo."
The young man remembers that even when he was seven years old he traveled to Zapopan for the graduation of his family, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he liked most in life: piloting an aircraft.
They say their last goodbyes

Three bodies found abandoned on Cadereyta NL farm
Hours before the discovery, the military authority presented to the media eleven people who were arrested in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shot to death in different parts of the body and with the shot of grace, in an abandoned farm in the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo Le<0xC3><0xB3>n.
The find happened at kilometer 1.5 of the road from Cadereyta to Santiago, at the height of the community known as El Castillo.
Several people who passed by the place observed that in the fifth, whose fence is beige with coffee, was the gate opened wide.
When they looked inwards, about three meters away, they located the bodies of three people, so they immediately gave notice to the corresponding authorities.
One of the individuals was wearing a yellow shirt with dark denim pants, without shoes; next to him was another with a white tank top.
A few feet away was the body of another individual in a red shirt and blue denim pants.
The three of them were face down.
According to the data obtained at the site, the three people would have been killed elsewhere, since no caps were found at the site.
In the fence of the fifth you can see legends that are directed from one group of organized crime to another, in addition to several bullet holes in it and the gate.
11 captured in Cadereyta
The Ministry of National Defense presented 11 people, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that operated mainly in the municipality of Cadereyta and who are related to kidnappings, homicides, "falconry" and clandestine burials.
According to the information released, in a first act on November 11 in the colony Los Alveros were arrested eight people and managed to rescue one who remained deprived of his freedom.

Marking the stop and making the inspection, the military found a long gun, a magazine and 18 cartridges.
On 13 November at 2 p.m., one of his accomplices was arrested in the La Frauda ejido, who, on seeing the military, tried to flee.
They are attributed to clandestine burials in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday.
Prime Minister-designate Mario Monti will meet with Italy’s president tomorrow to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put that country on the brink of economic disaster.
Italian Prime Minister-designate Mario Monti will meet with Italy’s president on Wednesday to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and put the entire eurozone in danger.
A presidential palace statement said Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm he can form a government.
It is expected to present a cabinet composed mostly of technocrats, although it is unclear when the new executive will take office.
Monti said he will present to the president the outcome of his talks with political parties in his bid to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," he told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly say he would be able to form a government but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles have been overcome.
The "framework is now well delineated," he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, far less than usual, as Italy grapples with a political and financial crisis that has pushed its debt costs to unsustainable levels.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package demanded by European leaders to regain the battered confidence in Italy.
Underscoring pressure on Monti to hurry, market instability put the yield on 10-year Italian BTP bonds above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to be bailed out.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian employers’ association Confindustria, told reporters after meeting Monti: “We said we would support this government a lot.”
We believe that this Government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
Monti’s chances of success were boosted considerably by the support of Silvio Berlusconi’s PDL party, which the crisis forced to resign on Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are destined to have a good result," Angelino Alfano, secretary of the center-right party, told reporters.
The support of the PDL, Italy’s largest party, is significant because so far many of its members had opposed the technocratic-majority government that is forming Monti.
Parliamentary support
Monti’s new government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what are likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockage or delay in their efforts could provoke a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks added to the pressure by warning that a failure by Monti would be a disaster.
Monti began consultations with political parties, trade unions and business groups, as well as youth and women’s organizations on Monday.
It will end its round of meetings on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, who has enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite late last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign, Italian debt costs have now returned to critical levels amid uncertainty over whether the new prime minister will succeed.
Rescuing Italy, with a public debt of 1.8 trillion euros, would be too much for the eurozone’s current financial defenses.
Monti has said his government should last until the next election, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement reforms before the elections are over.
Monti has said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but major parties insist it must be made up only of technicians, an indication of their qualms in the face of a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources noted that mutual mistrust and disagreements between parties are complicating the attempt to include political figures.
The touch of the Spaniards is superior to that of the Ticos
Of the 22 footballers called from Spain, ten exceed the 50 international games.
On Costa Rica’s side, only one of the 22 participants reached all 50 matches.
A major contrast to that of Costa Rica, if we compare the 22 called by both countries for today's friendly, at 3:05 p.m., at the National Stadium of San Jose.
While the world and European champions, number one in the monthly FIFA ranking, account for a wide record of class A interselection games, the Tricolor only has defender Michael Uma<0xC3><0xB1>a as the only one that has all 50 international matches.
This figure was reached the previous Friday in the match against Panama (0-2), in Rommel Fernandez.
The Spanish footballers who play in the League of Stars and in powerful clubs of the Premier League of England, maintain an intense activity in domestic league and cup championships, and high-level clashes in European cups such as the Champions League.
To the above is added the experience with the Spanish Fury in complicated qualifiers of the European Championship and the World Cup.
Ticos players, on the other hand, have a limited international touch in an area, such as Concacaf, which is considered the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the highest record of the Spanish national team is the goalkeeper <0xC3><0x8D>ker Casillas, who the previous Saturday against England (fall 0-1 in London) equaled the record of the exporter Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings.
Casillas will play today against the Tricolor and will impose a new record for Spain of 127 internationalities.
Xavi Hernández, Barcelona's head coach, owns 106.
Casillas and Xavi, even, were recognized the previous week by UEFA along with the other centenarians of the Iberian team, the aforementioned Zubizarreta with 126 and the ram of the Schalke, Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l González, with 102.
Almost close to the centenary figure is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61; and David Silva, with 53.
On the tico side, and close to Michael Uma<0xC3><0xB1>a, are the left-back Junior D<0xC3><0xAD>az, with 48 presences and the gunner Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five surpassed 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis L<0xC3><0xB3>pez with 35.
The less.
With more than 30 performances in Spain, Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Arbeloa (31) and Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 appearances, Roy Miller appears with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest don't get close to 20.
While Nacho Moreal only has four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Victor Bol<0xC3><0xAD>var has only one and <0xC3><0x93>lman Vargas and Edder Nelson still do not debut.
Spain’s historic goalscorer is David Villa, with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
By Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who records the most with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.

"Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In an exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said the band is ready to play one of their best shows next Sunday at the National Stadium.
It has been more than 20 years of waiting, but the band assures that for them it will also be to make the dream of playing in the country a reality.
This was assured by bassist and founding member, Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively with Viva, from Brazil, last week.
The group is on the South American wing of its tour celebrating two decades of work and on Sunday 20 will make its only stop in Central America.
That day they will perform at the Estadio Nacional, starting at 7:30 p.m., along with the angeline band The X and the Las Robertas Nationals.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, the full transcript of which is in The Nation on the Internet.
For his Costa Rican fans, it is a dream come true that Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica, are they aware of what their fans are experiencing?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is just our second time in South and Central America and so far it has been great.
I have been to Costa Rica only once and on vacation; it is such a beautiful country and I think we will be able to stay a few days there.
So we’re excited to bring our music there.
I ask because there is a kind of devotion to the band, the fans live intensely the days before.
What do you say to your most devoted followers?
Thank you for staying by our side through all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so long and we regret that it took us so long to get there.
Some people even already refer to their concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does that add a little pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we’ve played over the last 21 years happened over the last couple of weeks.
We played a couple of gigantic shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that has put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We are really looking forward to playing there.
We love that country, we love surfing and the jungle; for both, Costa Rica is among the best in the world.
How did you discover Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
We have many friends who are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves there are amazing.
My friends were always going to surf in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along with Mexico, are great places to surf; that’s how we found out, through people who love surfing.
Seeing the tour, they have been delivering huge shows with many songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
As we have never played there before, then we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to give the best possible show with a good variety of songs; we will try to play a couple of songs from each album and give our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What's this all about?
I think it’s partly because we have nine records and we can play over 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it’s hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we have not played for a while, that keeps us focused and also keeps us surprised because it reminds us of the reasons why we liked those songs and that we could have forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting to us and therefore I think it also makes it more interesting to people.
With this tour, they are celebrating 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe all they have achieved?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I think none of us imagined that we would be in a great rock band and having done it for over 20 years makes it seem like a dream.
We continue to count our blessings and we are very excited that we can continue to make music together.
We all love each other and we love making music.
We are lucky to go to places in the world that we always wanted to go.
Things couldn't be better for us.
What did it mean for you to have been a fundamental part of the emergence of grunge?
It’s always been an honor to be part of that group of great bands.
We are very friends of the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It’s surprising when a move comes from a group of friends and it’s rare.
Every now and then, a gang emerges from a city, but it is much stranger when five or ten gangs leave the same city at the same time.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on their tour, so we’re lucky to be friends with all of them still and we’re honored to be a part of that Seattle sound that came out.
It’s also very strange that a band like yours would stay together and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which, by itself, is a lot longer than many bands last.
First, I think we’re all lucky to still be alive, and second, we all care about each other.
We are all very close friends and, thanks to that, musical avenues have also been opened that give everyone freedom to experiment.
We trust each other with each other’s music and it couldn’t be better.
Your relationship with the word fame has not been simple; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do what you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we have grown, it has been easier to find a balance.
We make sure you don’t get too much touring because it’s easy to fall into that game of the big crowds and the people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people are there for the music, that reminds you to respect the music and what brought it, not to be infatuated with being famous and being a rock star, something that none of us really care about.
How do you remember your other Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote really good songs and at the beginning it was a great thing.
We were a band for almost three years and never released an album until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There were a lot of frustrations because it lasted so long and the most important thing is that we are still very friends of Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started in the band with us and when I hear a song or see a picture I think about the amazing person Andy was and how it made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and much more.
He was an amazing human being and we missed him.
The national band Las Robertas will be in charge of opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that is why you chose her for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos with several proposals and that was the band that we liked the most, so we are eager to see what Las Robertas can offer live and should be very entertaining.
Why do they always change the lyrics of Yellow Ledbetter live?
That’s a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don’t know.
He sings it and I think he does it with the first thing that comes to mind.
As a bass player, what are your influences?
There are so many.
Among the first ones that come to mind are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bass players that I love.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep grunge relevant despite not being a fad anymore?
I think all of us always feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I mentioned before, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all of those that came up at the same time, and, if there’s relevance now, I think it’s a wonderful thing because it’s music that’s worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney are now making better music than ever.
At first, his music had a darker content and now it has become more positive.
What is the reason for this change?
It’s interesting because I think there are a couple of songs on the new album that may seem lighter, but there are also songs, like The End or Just Breathe that qualify as very dark songs although they may sound a bit positive.
With both, when Ed touched me, I cried when I heard them and they are deeply dark songs.
I think when you grow up and there’s some trauma in your life and you lose a family member or a friend, those things start to influence your art and your music and those two songs, no doubt, represent that to me.
Also, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make music that is dark.
Peru:
Fujimori hospitalized again for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted Tuesday to a public hospital to be evaluated for the loss of muscle strength in his legs, his family doctor said.
Fujimori, 72, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his rule (1990-2000), suffers from a number of ailments, including cancer of the tongue he has been operated on four times and which remains under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal physician, told Channel N television that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for the pain and loss of strength in his lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate to get the benefit of the pardon for humanitarian reasons, however, he said he does not want it because he knows he is innocent.
He was operated four times from cancer to the tongue, has a weight loss of 18 kilos to which have been added other pathologies such as severe erosive gastritis, cyst of the pancreas, kidney stones, hypertension and circulatory problems in the legs, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been in detention since September 2007 at the National Police Special Operations Directorate.
In April 2009 he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people at the hands of an army annihilation squad that operated clandestinely in the early years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official delegation, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica and made up of several ministers and businessmen, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday in order to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, the highest point of an extensive agenda of meetings with political and commercial authorities and a meeting with the community of Uruguayans residing in Mexico, according to the agenda disseminated by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents, in the city of Guadalajara, will be "propitious for the exchange of information in all political matters between the two nations," according to the presidency of the South American country on its website.
According to local media, Mujica would seek to get Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n to support Uruguay in the incident with France that arose when the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, included the South American country in a list of tax havens, at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that remain tax havens, a statement that provoked Uruguay’s rejection and the call for consultation with its ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has chaired the G20 since November, a group made up of the most powerful emerging and developed countries in the world, and has in force with the South American country, since January of this year, an agreement to exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has tried in recent years to speed up the implementation of tax exchange agreements in order to leave the "grey list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), formed by countries that did not implement all the international standards of cooperation in tax matters.
In terms of trade, Mexico and Uruguay have had a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in force since 2004, which has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The mustachioed plumber passes the three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought tirelessly for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but never before has he done so in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the girl's love in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which hits stores around the world this month, has been designed from the outset to take advantage of the features of the Nintendo 3DS handheld console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without using glasses.
"Mario is the character who has to say how stereoscopy should work without glasses," said Nintendo's head of specialized press in Spain, Omar Alvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game originally intended for that support", since so far hits such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesman has argued that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "accessible" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and fluid game.
Alvarez has stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to hook less skilled users.
Once passed, the more experts will be able to give a "second turn" to the levels of play, which this time present greater difficulty.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it will be necessary to play in three dimensions to be able to overcome the different challenges and "not succumb to optical illusions".
This incursion of Super Mario in the three dimensions also means the return of the character to a portable console, a fact that has not been produced since 2005.
In this video game, Nintendo gives nods to the fans of the saga and repeats the formula of the success of the previous installments, consisting of the mustache plumber will have to travel platforms mined for dangers in order to free Princess Peach.
Although the player will find new moves, environments, costumes and enemies and also a "playable" Luigi.
Colom supports Portillo’s extradition to the United States
President <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Colom announced Tuesday that he has processed the extradition of former governor Alfonso Portillo to answer in the United States for the conspiracy to launder $70 million.
Thus ends the process for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country that claimed Portillo to judge there.
In a press conference, Colom said that his decision is due to the independence of judicial and executive powers, taking into account that a sentencing court had already ordered the extradition.
He said that during his term he "did not get his hands on" judicial decisions and processed all the extraditions he has known.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroqu<0xC3><0xAD>n, for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking, will be extradited.
Colom’s case is an executive proceeding after all judicial and constitutional instances were exhausted to prosecute the former president between 2000 and 2004.
According to decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo should be extradited once his legal situation in Guatemala has been resolved and his human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted of embezzlement of Q120 million in the Ministry of Defense when he was president, which was the process that preceded extradition, but the Public Ministry appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was born to avoid the fall in the marginality of untrained children
The balance of the first 25 years of life of the social support entity Trinijove is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have received help to overcome a difficult situation throughout this quarter of a century.
To this is added the hundred long jobs currently obtained for this social group.
The anniversary served to take stock at an event held in the former factory complex of Fabra i Coats attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was born in the neighbourhood of Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with little training, without work, with problems of dogradici<0xC3><0xB3>n or in a situation of falling into marginality.
The celebration yesterday in Sant Andreu concentrated a large number of leaders of entities and institutions that in these 25 years have collaborated with the association.
The varied political representation, in full electoral time, showed the unitary character of the work done by Trinijove.
Together with the president of the Generalitat, Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the former Socialist Education Minister, Ernest Maragall, and the ex-mayor and current ecosocialist councilor Ricard Gom<0xC3><0xA0> attended the event.
The current Minister of Social Welfare and Family, Josep Llu<0xC3><0xAD>s Cleries, and the general director of the social work of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, also attended the great hall of the Fabra i Coats.
Mas said that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that the current one is too, but added that the work done so far "is a good basis".
The president set Trinijove as an example by knowing how to fight against bad circumstances and by giving hope to people in difficulty.
“The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does,” he said.
Evicted a squatted farm where macro parties were held
The invaders had taken possession of 11 of the 13 floors of the building, in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants left the farm at noon yesterday without offering resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare lived by the neighbors of 51 de la calle de Balmes has come to an end.
Twelve people voluntarily left yesterday afternoon the property they occupied illegally, and where they organized macro parties that despaired the neighborhood, by court order and without the need for police intervention.
When the operation was over, the door lock was changed to prevent a repeat of the situation.
"From now on there will be access control," the administrator said.
The squatters, who had invaded 11 of the 13 floors of the building - the rest are inhabited - took away all the electrical installation and part of the water, in addition to painting the walls and leaving waste of all kinds, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
The first three floors were the scene of the massive parties, which lasted up to two days and despaired the tenants.
Next to the building is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which has also been damaged.
Owner Maria Pantinat told Europa Press that since the building was occupied the business has dropped by 80%.
The owner of the nightclub points out that the invaders of the estate were unfair competition, since they sold the glasses for three euros, while in the disco they are worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the leisure place had had to respond to neighborhood complaints for noise, while, according to him, the discomfort is not caused by the customers of the nightclub, but by the inhabitants of the squatted house and, above all, the attendees to the parties that were organized there, which had increased its frequency and intensity in recent weeks, according to the angry neighbors of the area.
The head of the nightclub explained that the discomfort was so great that he even reached an agreement with the owner of the property and nine months ago he "forgives" the rent.
The Guardia Urbana also confirmed that in recent weeks it had received more complaints from neighbors about the situation.
The president of the PP municipal group in the city council, Alberto Fernández D<0xC3><0xAD>az, had demanded last week "immediately evict the property to end the problems of coexistence and civility that produce the neighbors, as well as the degradation of the area."
The popular leader explained that before the summer there was only one floor of the building occupied, but over the last few months the squatters had been entering all the floors of the building and almost all the floors, and that in some there have even been robberies.
In this sense, he added that, "it is necessary to end impunity and be forceful against the incivility that has been generated on the farm."
Also yesterday, the Mossos evicted a building in Nou Barris.
At 1530 hours the police made their way to 35 Mont-ral Street after receiving a call from a neighbour who had observed four people entering the building.
All four were arrested at the time.
Park or mountain?
The architects agree on the opportunity of the call beyond controversies about fees
The municipal competition on the 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, in the heyday of the now defunct Corporaci<0xC3><0xB3>n Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration printed some promotional leaflets for Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great park of metropolitan Barcelona.
What’s more, it was accompanied by a comparison, in figures, with New York’s Central Park.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park was once again placed, in the imagination of many, as the upper limit of Barcelona, being the Catalan capital of the few that are not oriented on the north-south axis but up (mountain) -down (sea).
The qualification of Collserola as a natural park results in this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with the wild boars in the role of the Yogi bear.
These were until, in September, the city council convened a mega-competition consisting of 16 contests for as many access doors to Collserola.
A door refers to the idea of a park, without a doubt.
Either that or someone is trying to put doors in the field.
The question comes up: Collserola, park or mountain?
The competition, both for its purely organizational aspect and for what it means to reflect on the city is the topic of conversation among all Barcelona architects.
It is almost a recurring theme to be used when two members of this ancient caste of elect recognize each other in an elevator.
And this fact gives rise, precisely, to one of the few coincidences between what three Barcelona architects think, and university professors, who have presented themselves.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel M<0xC3><0xB2>dol and Marta Bayona: the competition is timely.
For Roldán, after addressing the coastal front "it becomes necessary" to discuss "the mountain front", since the speech of Ildefons Cerd<0xC3><0xA0>, that of green apples, has not been carried out.
"It is necessary to start from the base that the most extensive park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things because of its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex", says the architect for whom the title of "doors of Collserola" encloses a "lexical trap": we must not think of them "as accesses to a park, but the delimitation of areas where we have to act".
M<0xC3><0xB2>dol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, describes the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers".
Dangers derived from the "uncertainty that it is today to project the public space" after the experience lived in the 80s and that had in the area of the Forum "his swan song".
The first fear is the very delimitation of borders on where it can be built.
"To limit something is to fix the next step," that is to say, its overtaking.
“We have to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current ones [referring to the Metropolitan General Plan (MGP)] can lead to real disasters.”
Closer to the question, M<0xC3><0xB2>dol believes that, simplifying, the Valls side of Collserola "can be understood as a park, that of Barcelona, no", for a purely topographical question.
M<0xC3><0xB2>dol recalls that there is already a work done by the Patronat de Collserola that "should not fall on deaf ears", although he appreciates the opportunity that the city council offers his guild to intervene in this project "from the first moment".
And even more, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the safe-conduct that allows architects to enter the debate, but "doubts" about whether it is this technical profile that must lead the multidisciplinary teams ("a total success", he points out) that have had to be created: "Architects should be just a tool".
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gives the title to this piece is complex, because the bases of the contest lack a global vision of Collserola: "16 transversal competitions have been convened - he says - in the mountain-sea sense, but there is no longitudinal reading, which sees and understands the area as a whole".
This means, at least in your case, that you have chosen to participate in the 16 contests.
Otherwise, a project for one of the doors may collide in program and definition with that of the architect of the next door.
In his opinion, however, the city council should ensure that the area immediately above the Ronda de Dalt should provide, in all its extension, an area of facilities that would make a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonas Larrazábal and will go free
After 72 days of rooting, the legal representative of Casino Red granted forgiveness to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey of the process that followed him for alleged blackmail
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonas Larrazábal will be released after the legal representative of Casino Red granted him a pardon before the Second Criminal District Court, which follows a process for blackmail against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the attack on Casino Royale, the owner of Casino Red, Sergio Gil Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a, made public a series of photographs and videos in which allegedly Manuel Jonas demanded the payment of an economic fee for the city council to allow the clandestine operation of the bookmaker.
After the public denunciation, the State Procuratorate opened a criminal case against the brother of the Panista mayor and on September 2 was arrested and rooted for 30 days.
After four hours before the Public Prosecutor’s Office 3 in Patrimonial Crimes, he was transferred to the Casa de Arraigo 1, located in the Old Quarter of the state capital.
He remained there for 49 days after a second arrest warrant was issued after the Public Prosecutor ' s Office had dismissed the crimes of bribery and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to the Cadereyta prison allegedly for blackmailing the owners of the Casino Red with one and a half million pesos; however, he only remained a few hours in the medium-security prison since there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to follow the trial held in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On October 25, an arrest warrant was issued for him by the secretary of the Second Criminal District Court, Jorge Yánez, who said that after almost two months of investigations enough evidence was verified to determine Jonah’s guilt, such as the collection of 1.5 million pesos from the representatives of the bookmaker in exchange for allowing the operation of the same.
This Monday, the legal representative of Casino Red, V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Aldo Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a G<0xC3><0xB3>mez, went before the judge José Luis Pecina to request forgiveness for the brother of the regal mayor; so in the coming hours he could regain his freedom.
During the legal process, the agent of the Public Prosecutor attached to the Court, Ramiro Arias, questioned Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a G<0xC3><0xB3>mez if the damage had been repaired and who of the partners of the bookmaker was the one who granted the pardon, although the lawyer tried to reserve the name.
On the basis of file 197/2011, Jonas Larrazábal is granted a legal pardon and henceforth no claim can be made about the process that followed him; In addition, he will not be required to make reparation for damage or punishment.
After the hearing to the legal representative of the bookmaker, about 15:50 was ordered the immediate release of Larrazabal Bret<0xC3><0xB3>n.
The secretary of the Court, Jorge Yánez, moved to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolás de los Garza to notify Jonah that he has been legally forgiven and his file will be archived.
It will also notify you of the immediate release order issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the plane crash where the Secretary of the Interior, Francisco Blake, and seven other people lost their lives
The Ministry of Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the results released on the accident where the Secretary of the Interior, Francisco Blake Mora, and seven other people lost their lives, indicate that the helicopter impacted directly on the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before taking off the aircraft, the pilot found that the weather conditions were suitable for flying.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the ground, the blades had contact with trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage."
He also reported that the unit was designed for 19 people, so it had the necessary requirements to transport the personnel.
In addition, he said that investigations made in the area of the impact do not report the appearance of pieces on the ground.
"In a search it is reported that there are no parts or components of the craft elsewhere, the impact was presented structurally.
“The design of the helicopter was for 19 passengers, it had adequate requirements to transport the passengers.
The terrain presents a slope of seven degrees at 30 degrees of inclination.
At the moment, the secretary said that it is a priority to have the results as soon as possible; however, the investigation can last several months, even could reach a year.
Gilberto L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Meyer, general director of Airports and Auxiliary Services, said that at the time of the impact, the helicopter of the Presidential General Staff was operating at cruising speed and that this happened in an ascending soft terrain.
"This information strengthens the hypothesis of a normal cruise operation at the time of impact," he said.
At the press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to aeronautical regulations, the flight was performed under visual flight rules, this implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and the terrain.
Weather conditions:
The reports in the AICM located suitable conditions for takeoff, as the aircraft advances towards the border area between the DF and the State of Mexico, there were layers of cloud at low altitude.
Selected routes:
It is likely that due to the cloud conditions the crew sought an area of lower elevation and greater visibility towards the valley of Cuernavaca.
Location of impact.
The impact coordinates and the last radar record of the aircraft coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration in the flight path.
Dispersion of aircraft debris in a restricted area:
The information available so far allows us to assume that the impact occurred in a straight and sideways trajectory.
The pattern of dispersion of aircraft debris allows us to assume that the helicopter was hit on the ground under conditions of structural integrity.
No evidence of fire or explosion has been detected:
At the site of the accident, no evidence remains on the wreckage of the ship of any kind of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that he may have had multiple contacts with the field.
During the field work pieces of the aircraft have been found at an elevation of 9,200 feet above mean sea level, the terrain has a slope ranging from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which it was predictably disarticulated along this route.
The information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts on the ground.
After a thorough search over a wider area than the cordoned-off site around the crash site, no scattered pieces of the aircraft were found, strengthening the presumption that the impact occurred under conditions of structural integrity.
MSS Announces Protocol to Find Obesity Gene
Social Security Leads Research to Discover Obesity Gene in Children and Youth; Supported by IPN Specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) announced that it is conducting research to discover the obesity gene in children and young people, called the "Childhood and Adolescence Obesity Genetics" protocol, which will allow for markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry of the Hospital of Specialties of the National Medical Center Siglo XXI, Miguel Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was integrated.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Center for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
In the research it is invited to participate to the population whether or not entitled, to go to the participating sports units of the IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where the tests are carried out to the minors, every Saturday from 8:00 hours.
He stressed that the protocol began in the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (State of Mexico Poniente) and that since October 8, the activity is carried out in the Nezahualc<0xC3><0xB3>yolt Sports Unit (State of Mexico East).
Once the goal of bringing together 500 or 600 minors is met, the study will continue in the Independencia Sports Unit (south of the Federal District) and finally in the Morelos Sports Unit (north of the Federal District).
He explained that the purpose of this research is to know the components and the importance of genetics with respect to the development of obesity and to identify risk factors in Mexican children and young people to prevent the onset of chronic degenerative diseases.
Celebrating World Diabetes Day on 14 November, he said the goal is to bring together 3,000 children and young people between six and 14 years of age, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the application of specific questionnaires on food.
They will also be asked about physical activity and family history of diseases, in order to avoid risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He explained that on Saturdays anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference), blood pressure measurement, determination of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin levels and genetics (searches to identify genes associated with childhood obesity) are applied to all participants.
Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez pointed out that this research is due to the concern of health professionals for the alarming weight gain in minors.
"The health surveys of 1999 and 2006 indicated that in just six years there was an increase, in the case of boys, of 77 percent in obesity, and of girls of 47 percent; in terms of overweight, a dramatic rise was also observed," said the IMSS specialist.
He indicated that the justification for the search for the markers is based on the fact that the population of the country differs from others due to its genetic history.
He reported that on average, the Mexican has 65 percent American Indian, 30 percent European and five percent African heritage and this condition is reflected in genes that are associated with diabetes and excess weight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity translates into the inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calories) and that is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the participants is the comprehensive evaluation of the children, which allows to detect if they have any degree of overweight or obesity.
Even, he said, the presence of dark colored folds (acanthosis) in the neck and forearm, which indicate the likelihood of suffering metabolic alterations and even prediabetes.
The information is handled confidentially, doctors give it in writing to the parents, who are explained each of the measurements and lifestyle changes they must make to prevent diseases.
Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentary lifestyle, which is the lack of daily physical activity, staying most of the day sitting in front of the television and using means of transport instead of walking short distances.
It is also due to the high caloric intake, that is, the higher consumption of sugary drinks, carbohydrates (sizes, bread, pizza, hamburger, etc.) with high fat and protein content and the genetics analyzed in this protocol.
Asphalt of the UNAM would avoid potholes
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry of the UNAM, develops polymer-modified asphalts to produce a mixture with better performance, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signals sent by the pavement were met, it would not be necessary to repair about 200,000 potholes each rainy season in the Metropolitan Area of the Valley of Mexico, warned Rafael Herrera Nájera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of the UNAM, who assured that if the process of construction and maintenance of an asphalt pavement is the right one, the potholes could be reduced in quantity or even eliminated.
In his lecture A technological opinion of potholes, dictated in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory in charge develops asphalts modified with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera estimated that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the weather is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve its performance and, therefore, the formation of potholes.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, some of high molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and others of low molecular weight, called maltenes, which together give the pavement its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of asphalt consists in that at high temperatures, close to 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees Celsius its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees Celsius it presents an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes brittle, he added.
The above means that in the streets the resistance of the asphalt is not uniform, but it is modified during the day according to the environmental and temperature conditions, warned the specialist in chemical engineering.
The FQ researcher observed that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered by flexible pavement, which consists of six layers of materials, of which the last three involve asphalt.
Among the most superficial layers is the asphalt binder, made up of small stones bathed in asphalt and then compacted.
Each of the stones that make up the folder, he pointed out, is bathed in asphalt.
As the vehicles travel and forces are generated, this allows the forces to diffuse very well on the pavement.
If it were modified asphalt they would spread even better, the chemical engineer said.
Over the asphalt binder, he added, a last layer called a rolling binder is placed, which is made of a fine stone material, that is, a sand that is also bathed in asphalt.
As this is the layer that will be in contact with the tires of the vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt binder and provide friction on the road.
Being the part of the pavement that will receive and spread the efforts, the rolling folder also requires having the appropriate thickness and the material of which it is made must be taken care of.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he said, because it significantly affects asphalt binder performance.
When the soil is wet, the water diffuses inside the folder and it is difficult to get out, this causes a softening of all the layers of the pavement and, therefore, the formation of potholes.
In the process of forming a pothole, he said, the first to wear out is the rolling film and only then the asphalt binder is affected, but the damage does not occur instantly, but is a process that should be attended to at the first signs with proper maintenance programs.
The also member of the National System of Researchers explained that the vehicular load is another important factor in the formation of potholes and, therefore, the thickness of each of the layers of the pavement must always go in relation to the vehicular load and ensure that it is fulfilled, to avoid that potholes are formed frequently.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to investigate and work on the asphalt, for example, asphalt emulsions, which in other countries are already on the market and allow to repair potholes easily and without the need to use high temperatures.
What did the candidate of the Valley lack to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that influenced Melina Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez Serna not to reach the crown of Se<0xC3><0xB1>orita Colombia.
The Valley gets its 14th princess title.
Again the Valle del Cauca is left with the desire for the crown of Se<0xC3><0xB1>orita Colombia.
This time Melina Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez Serna had to settle for being on the podium of winners, wearing the silver crown and the band that accredit her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantic stood up with the crown and the scepter, the department already adds 14 titles of Princess and Melina joins the legion of Vallecaucana women who have been close to the crown but who were proclaimed princesses among them Miriam Maria Ospina Benoit (1989), Maria Arena (1989), Clara Dom<0xC3><0xAD>nguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Garva).
Today the big question many are asking is what was missing?
Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite who in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, not in vain was elected Queen of the Police and Best Face Jolie of Vogue, titles that obtained queens such as Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that is considered key in the jury's decision to designate her First Princess is that she did not convince with her answer to the question "What is that book that has marked you and why?" made by Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n Murillo G<0xC3><0xB3>mez, of the Literary Cart Leamos.
To the questioner the Vallecaucana replied:
“I read a lot, I believe a lot in literature, I think it’s a way of getting cultural, I definitely think the book that marked me from childhood is ‘The Little Prince’, it’s a pretty profound book.
I currently read "Crime and Punishment", it is a book of universal literature that we should all read; and today I am reading the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a very beautiful book called "The Burning of Blood".
A response that disliked first by the term "culturalize" and second for not explaining in a concrete way how each of the books he cited have marked it.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina said she felt calm and happy with the result "the universe is wise no matter what has to happen.
And for all the people, please read a little bit, "The Little Prince" is a great book.
Among the hypotheses launched it is said that Valle was burned by favoritism.
A Bogotá journalist suggested that being the favorite, the ovated and the candidate who took all the preliminary awards (Oster gastronomy challenge, public vote for the best handmade costume, and Queen Mother), "that aroused the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and therefore did not shine on the stage."
And that was noted in her first swimsuit performance on Hilton Beach and her two coronation evening parades.
Although she looked confident in both, it was noted that she lacked the strength and momentum that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantico did demonstrate.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program "Como en casa", of the RCN Channel, opined that the fact that Melina was designated a princess "proves that the candidate who wins the most prizes during the contest does not remain as queen".
In addition, Valle was at last very dodgy with the press, and there he was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of his interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
For some reason, two days before the election the international jury Lucy Doughty said that they were looking for a woman committed to the social needs of her country.
"Beauty alone is not enough in a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond the physical and focus on your social sensitivity, that before entering the Contest are already involved in projects," he explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned for her defects in the derriere and the fibrosis that was noted in her abdomen, but it is contradictory because precisely the jury chose her as the candidate 'Natural beauty' with the healthiest body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
Queens coach Jorge Hernán Orozco acknowledges that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better, "but her problem of fibrosis in the abdomen, which the truth to me was not very noticeable, dropped points in the last day."
Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos, of the magazine Cromos considers that the error of the vallecaucana were the surgical interventions that were practiced.
“The surgeries are fine, but Valle didn’t know how to do them.
His body was never his forte and here they charged him.”
For this award, which for the first time delivers the National Beauty Contest, after the parade in swimsuit emerged a cruel prediction that last night was fulfilled, because it was said that this was the contentment that Raymundo granted to Melina not to give her the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina from today begins a year of reign, not as sovereign, but as a princess, a position that gives her the possibility to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions by designation of the National Competition itself.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite her overwhelming passage through Cartagena, was able to dodge the crown.
So was the work of the cale<0xC3><0xB1>o who identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano
A lofoscopist from Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is key.
On November 4, a lofoscopist from the CTI of Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the identity of the FARC’s top leader: “Alfonso Cano”, through the matching of his fingerprints.
Of the seven lofoscopists who work in the CTI section, that week it was the turn of "availability" to Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in the area of judicial investigation for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the municipalities of Choc<0xC3><0xB3>, where he often had to spend more than five days in the jungle to reach the site where the bodies were to be identified.
In 2000 he moved to the capital of the Valley and, after completing the corresponding courses, specialized in lophoscopy, which is the study of the skin of friction, that is, the palms of the hands and feet.
The week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano to Eliazar warned him to wear minimum clothes for three days.
Something big was waiting for him.
Friday night he left for Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew that he had to identify two corpses and that one of them was suspected to be the man who led the oldest guerrilla in the world, so they asked him to carry the decadactyl card of Guillermo Le<0xC3><0xB3>n Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the investigation team at the site where the body was located, he did not recognize it because of its physical appearance, as it was very different from what he had seen in the media.
He was beardless, dressed like a local peasant, without glasses and much thinner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Accompanied by a Galtonian magnifying glass, ink, a transplanter and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the fingerprints on the corpse to those on the card.
His eye did not fail him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was in charge of confirming to the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinz<0xC3><0xB3>n, that he was the head of the FARC.
In Search of the Footprint
For a typist from the Sikhin of Cali, the recognition made by President Juan Manuel Santos to Eliazar González, in the press conference for the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
A lot of people don’t know our work.
Fingerprinting is an exact science, with no margin for error, which can become key in solving crimes.
Apart from identifying corpses, lofoscopists support investigations for crimes such as theft and homicide and confirm the identity of the captured persons.
When caught, many offenders present false IDs or have no papers.
We take their fingerprints and look them up in the database.
The investigator said that, in a case of theft, he had to remove a piece of wall from a house, because in that place the thief had supported his hand to take out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not suitable surfaces to make a fingerprint, but in that case we were able to obtain the fingerprint of the entire hand and identify the offender, who had participated in different thefts," he recalled.
Fingerprints can also rule out or reassert suspects in homicide cases.
They recently found a dead man, with bottles of liquor all around him.
Through the investigation it was determined that a relative could be a suspect in the crime and, indeed, a fingerprint on the bottle matched.
Although this does not guarantee that he was the killer, it does place him at the scene of the crime.
A CTI typist explained that in objects "the fingerprints are taken with chemical or physical reagents."
When they appear, a transplanter or tape is used to lift them.
After this, the prints are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the Registrar.
“The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians,” said the CTI expert.
He clarified that not everything is as shown on the TV show CSI.
Just as not everything that shines is gold, not everything that is touched becomes a trace.
However, if it can be used, if the respective matching is performed.
'Indignants' defy authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in front of Zuccotti Square to camp.
A large part attended the eviction order and moved to a nearby park.
The members of the Occupy Wall Street movement defied New York authorities on Tuesday by trying to enter again, under the protection of a court order, the Manhattan square from which they were evicted at dawn and by trying to occupy another park in the Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators crowded in front of Zuccotti Square, where they wanted access thanks to a court order that allows the "indignants" to return to camp in the place, while another part of the movement responded to the eviction by occupying a park further north of the city, where there have been new arrests.
“Our idea is that, if the court does not allow us to re-camp in the square, we will settle somewhere else and continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, as well as through peaceful sit-ins and demonstrations,” said Occupy Wall Street spokesman Mark Bray.
Bray explained that the response of the “indignant” to the eviction of their camp personally dictated by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, reached the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the forced evacuation of the place and allowing the protesters to remain camped.
In addition, the “indignant” proceeded to occupy a new park located at the confluence of the central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and owned by the parish of Trinity Church.
At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but then the police came and proceeded to arrest some of the protesters, although Bray could not confirm the specific figure, while he assured Efe that he saw several journalists who were also handcuffed.
The organization says that several hundred people had settled at that point, where a delegation of religious leaders has already moved in support of the members of the movement and has tried to mediate with the police.
Meanwhile, the Zuccotti square -which is a privately owned enclosure- remains closed pending the holding of a court hearing scheduled for this Tuesday in which the legality of the evacuation of this morning must be analyzed.
Some of the demonstrators displaced there carried and distributed copies of that court order at this time and even gave them to the agents guarding the square, which caused "some small clashes," said Bray, who reported that some officers beat the demonstrators.
The court order prohibits authorities from evicting Occupy Wall Street members or enforcing “laws that were issued after the occupation began or prohibiting protesters from re-entering the park with shops or other property they previously used.”
Mayor Bloomberg told reporters that, because of the court order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and protesters, warning them, however, that local laws do not allow them to re-establish themselves with tents and sleeping bags.
The councilor personally defended the eviction carried out early in the morning from Zuccotti Square, an operation in which about 200 arrests were made and which was decided because the demonstrators were "violating the law".
Bloomberg explained that he gave the order to evacuate the square because it was becoming "a place where people did not come to protest, but to violate the laws and, in some cases, to harm other people", since "some businesses had received threats" and neighbors feared "for their quality of life".
“This morning’s eviction was disgusting and shows that deep down Bloomberg is more interested in preserving financial interests than those of American workers,” added the movement’s spokesman, who accused the mayor of “disrespecting freedom of expression.”
Occupy Wall Street officials also said they plan to organize "major actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and labor unions to mark the two-month-long protests that began Sept. 17.
Pamela Anderson will play the Virgin Mary in a Christmas TV special.
Along with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, he will appear on the television show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1.
Canadian Pamela Anderson has been Tim Allen's assistant on "Home Improvement," lifeguard on "Baywatch," bunny on "Playboy," the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a Canadian television Christmas special.
Private broadcaster CTV announced today that Anderson, along with crooner Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the television show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1 featuring a very particular Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed footage of the television show in which Anderson, also known for the wide distribution on the internet of a pornographic home video in which she appears along with her then-husband, "M<0xC3><0xB6>tley Cr<0xC3><0xBC>e" drummer Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary holding in a manger a doll representing Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently served as host on part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour, appears as Jose.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, the CTV Christmas special features Canadian singer Bublé, who in late March married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires, and who is no stranger to controversy.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian a "slut" during one of his concerts in New York.
Japan reborn after earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the downward spiral that began in March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, still recovering from the devastating earthquake that led to a nuclear crisis, the worst catastrophe the country has suffered since World War II.
Initial estimates by the Government of Tokyo put the material losses at $300 billion, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, appears to have been mitigated.
After three consecutive quarters of declines, the data of the Gross Domestic Product between July and September served to turn the page, definitively: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% in annualized rate.
The second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - is also the fastest pace of growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery is explained, in part, by the upturn in the purchase of machinery to restore areas ravaged by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1%, compared to the 0.9% decrease in capital expenditures that was observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted increases.
However, the real revulsion of the Japanese economy is not based exclusively on the Keynesian impulse that invites us to take advantage of crises to strengthen - or rebuild - infrastructure, to use the shortcomings to grow from scratch.
Japan has woken up, above all, thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, driven by the increase in spending on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has been entrusted to the domestic market, when the yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the "safe haven values" chosen by investors fleeing the debt crisis in the euro zone and the murky forecasts of the US, a privilege that weighs like a slab in the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic flotation line is determined by the health of large technology groups.
Toyota and Sony, for example, blamed their weak results between July and September on the yen’s price.
While the markets continue their siege of the peripheral countries of the EU, the government of Yoshihiko Noda does not let down its guard.
“We need to be mindful of the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of Thailand’s floods, and the rapid appreciation of the yen,” said Secretary of State for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa.
And indeed, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said most member countries showed sharper signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates turning points in the world economy highlighted that the major powers are slowing down.
Since it fell four tenths to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
The euro zone, even, was below the average, which is at the level 100, rushing eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens feeds the doubts again
Papadimos says adjustments will be approved, but conservatives won’t sign any written pledge
With peripheral risk premiums skyrocketing and uncertainty reinstated in the parquets, Greece continues to get entangled in the maze that leads to the exit from the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Greek transitional government is imposed more by the demands of Brussels than by a genuine conviction of the political forces begins to be confirmed with facts.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the period of one hundred days agreed in his appointment may fall short to implement them, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, assured that he will not support new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections by the scheduled date, February 19.
"The main task of this government is to implement the decisions of the October 26 summit," Papadimos said as he opened a parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence in the new executive.
A package of 24 programmes to boost employment, reform the disciplinary code for civil servants and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras' message does not clear doubts about his position: "We are committed to helping the transitional government, but we have not committed to anything else."
The conservative leader went a step further in his pulse to the EU and the IMF, the bodies that must unlock the $8 billion that Athens urgently needs, and made it clear that he will not give his approval to any letter of commitment to comply with the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still reeling from the impact of the Papandreou referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not unblock the aid if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible".
Economic Affairs spokesman Amadeu Altafaj explained that the troika inspectors will return "very soon" to Athens to discuss with the new government "what is needed to pay the sixth tranche" of 8 billion euros, although there is no definitive date.
The Greek skein still has thread for a while.
Do<0xC3><0xB1>a Sof<0xC3><0xAD>a: "They are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights the "preponderant" place of Spain in relation to this type of finance
Spain "has reached a preponderant place worldwide in the role of Microfinance".
Queen Do<0xC3><0xB1>a Sof<0xC3><0xAD>a recalled yesterday that the country has become in these last two decades the second donor of the proposal in relation to this instrument of cooperation, whose "essence" she said lies in being an "instrument for social progress, justice and the hope of a better future for all humanity, based on trust in the human being".
The Queen inaugurated yesterday the V World Summit of Microcredit in Valladolid with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that this type of operations are "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the Millennium Goals established by the United Nations with horizon 2015, and, "most especially, in the one that has as its goal the reduction to half the volume of people living with incomes less than a dollar".
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "to all corners of the planet, and assumes this task with "responsibility", said Do<0xC3><0xB1>a Sof<0xC3><0xAD>a, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions that originate in the Summit, which will last until Thursday, "guarantee the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest, and especially for women", the main beneficiaries of these loans.
There are “many achievements” and “many challenges we face.”
The Microcredit Summit is proposed not only as a forum for debate, but also as the platform from which to promote "two basic goals".
Thus, His Majesty explained that by the end of 2015, 175 million poor families have accessed these financial services and that one hundred million of these households are out of the poverty line in which they are plunged.
The momentum in the conception of microcredits in Spain and in the rest of the world "has followed the path initiated years ago in a pioneering way" by Muhammad Yunus, Do<0xC3><0xB1>a Sof<0xC3><0xAD>a stressed as an "act of justice and due recognition".
He described the father of this tool as an “admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty”, whose work he has known for 15 years, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to learn about its lending policy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada 2006, and "in all I have been able to verify the continuous evolution", explained His Majesty, whose link with this project earned him yesterday the qualification of the "head of family" gathered in Valladolid by the "basquero of the poor".
Finally, Queen Do<0xC3><0xB1>a Sof<0xC3><0xAD>a concluded her speech by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to advance in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for any democratic state.
In this sense, he said that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic prosperity, since it is a "permanent obligation".
Jimenez considered that microcredits represent "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to eradicating poverty", and now "more than ever" the governments of developed countries must work under criteria of solidarity and not let it fall victim to the cuts.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
For her part, the Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, applauded "the success" of giving "confidence" to the people "excluded to whom everyone closes the doors"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier Le<0xC3><0xB3>n de la Riva, welcomed those present to a city that "opens its doors infected with the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the European President by universal suffrage
The first day of the congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) on Monday, November 14, in Leipzig, has passed without great difficulty for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and President of the Christian Democratic party.
Initially the future of Europe had not been included in the agenda, but the issue was imposed in the autumn, in particular to satisfy militants who consider that the government’s policy is currently too loose with the Greeks and could be in the future with the Italians.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the management, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1,001 delegates, only nine votes against and ten abstentions were recorded.
The standing ovation of several minutes that were won, with his interventions, Angela Merkel and, after several hours, Wolfgang Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble, the Europhile Minister of Finance, clear any possible doubt.
The key idea of the Chancellor, and of the motion, is summed up in a slogan: the response to the crisis "is not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe is peace, but also because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For the Chancellor, "the time has come to open the way in Europe".
This could manifest itself in amendments to the Lisbon Treaty to allow the European Union to strengthen its control over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, although it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage to "give a face to Europe".
In any case, that is one of the proposals of the motion adopted by Congress, clearly Wolfgang Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble’s idea.
Undoubtedly, it is unlikely that the twenty-seven will quickly reach an agreement on this radical change: Britain is hostile to him and the leaders of the CDU seem to know that Nicolas Sarkozy too.
The ball is on the ground.
On the other hand, delegates rejected by an overwhelming majority the proposal to weight each country’s weight of the European Central Bank’s directive according to the weight of each economy, which would obviously reinforce Germany’s weight.
Eager to calm the mood within her party, the Chancellor has increased the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but neither has she tried to win her congress at the expense of the "small" European countries or countries in difficulty willing to criticize the arrogant Germany.
Although the motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of "Franco-German friendship", Angela Merkel has not lied to France.
Except in passing.
Remembering that two centuries ago there was a bloody battle in Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats for Napoleon’s army.
The incidence of fraud in sick leave
After the subsidies, the UMP and the Government undertake an offensive against sick leave.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday, November 15, to visit a box responsible for family allowances and deliver a speech on the theme, already recurrent since 2007, of the fight against social fraud and childcare.
In addition, to accompany such an offensive, which is based on the desire to save rigorously, but still recalls an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, most want to focus on sick leave.
First, to implement budget cuts: the government plans to impose a fourth day of shortages on private sector workers before they can take the plunge.
In short, unless there is a specific company agreement, a worker who falls ill would lose four days of salary, that is, a minimum of 15% of his monthly income.
It is a measure that could raise a wave of anger, but that would save 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
In addition, it would be accompanied by another measure with a more symbolic scope: to impose on civil servants a day of absence without pay in case of absence from work (so far, they do not lack, compared to the three days that apply in the private sector).
While these issues are being debated, the majority is again putting the issue of fraud on the table, this time geared towards the abuse of work leave.
"The controls are going to increase considerably and, in addition, if someone is discovered committing fraud, he will have to reimburse the amounts," Xavier Bertrand warned speaking on the RTL on Sunday, November 13.
As in the other cases, the effects of the announcement appear to be slightly disproportionate to the reality of fraud in the area of work absences.
In fact, this issue has been constantly monitored since 2002 and a number of political offensives have been launched, which have normally borne fruit.
The French do not get sick any more than in the rest of Europe.
Let us look carefully, first of all, at the national figures.
According to the French Social Security Institute (CNAM), in 2006 more than 237 million euros were paid in benefits for sick leave.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Economics, sick leave subsidies accounted for 5% of health expenditure in 2008, amounting to 11.3 billion euros.
Of this sum, 46% corresponds to maternity and work-related accidents, while 54% is related to sick leave, a figure that amounts to 6.2 billion euros.
This accounts for 2.5% of healthcare spending.
In 2010, the French have taken an average of 14.5 days off work, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
An average that undoubtedly hides deviations: another survey, published in 2007 by the Syrian professional management Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed claimed that they had not taken a single day of sick leave.
Another study, in this case of the Assurance maladie, indicates that in 2010 37% of sick leave had a duration of less than 8 days, 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and a month, 15% between one and three months and 11% were longer.
Compared to our European neighbours, French workers are no more likely than in other areas to take sick leave.
A long study carried out in 2010 by two CNRS researchers indicated that, between 1994 and 2001, the overall rate of absence from work (both for health and other reasons) ranged from 10% to 11% in France, compared to 20% to 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or between 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Sick leave fraud is not particularly significant compared to undeclared work.
Fraud has a very limited scope.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has led to systematic checks on sick leave of more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million inspections, the CNAM found, in 13% of the 285,000 carried out, that short-term casualties were "unjustified or too long", that is, 37,050 cases.
In the case of casualties of more than 45 days, subjected to systematic inspections, it was considered that 11 per cent of the cases were "duly adapted or unjustified; a figure that, with a total of 1.2 million, amounts to 132,000.
As a result, a total of 169,000 “unwarranted” cases are reached among several million workers who took sick leave.
Certainly, an insignificant figure in comparison, for example, with black work.
According to MP Dominique Tian, author of a report on this issue in June, this practice would represent a loss of tax revenues of between 9 and 15 billion euros a year, that is, more than the total cost of the subsidies for casualties and, undoubtedly, considerably more than fraud in the latter area.
Papademos: Greece must implement a new adjustment plan
Greece is going to need a new adjustment plan to straighten out its economy.
This is what Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos said before Parliament on Monday, 14 November. He also added that the one hundred days that have been granted to his Union Government would not be enough to achieve this objective.
"To make efforts leading to the recovery of the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budgetary adjustment programme," said the head of government, who was delivering his first public speech at the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions adopted during the euro zone summit on October 27 will be the "main task" of the new government, since "it is at stake" the country's stay in the euro zone, he added.
As a result, Papademos has predicted that the country's public deficit will shrink "to around 9%" of GDP by the end of the year, after reaching 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right rejects new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the head of the right-wing group, showed his support on Monday for the measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis, but has warned that his party will not commit to additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote in favor of new measures," he said during a meeting with deputies from his New Democracy party.
He said he agreed with the goals of deficit and debt reduction, as well as fighting waste, but against any policy that prevents economic recovery.
To Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unblock the €8 billion loan needed without a written guarantee of all parties’ support for the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his word would be enough and that he would not sign anything because of external pressure.
Expert Panel Says Euthanasia and Assisted Suicide Must Be Legalized
Canadians living in denial of death, Royal Society of Canada report says
On palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, and not just in cases of cancer.
Canadian society continues to deny death.
In fact, only 9% of Canadians are willing to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make arrangements to do so.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, which was attended by six experts from various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
This committee recommends that the Government amend the Criminal Code so as to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, when the patient considers this option and has been judged competent to make the decision.
For starters, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit that compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada ranks tenth, the study notes that “the medicalization of death in Canada has generated a culture in which people are afraid to address the issue of death.”
With or without medication, 77 per cent of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to experts selected by the Royal Society of Canada.
And, despite the fact that most Canadians want to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying in hospital.
Overall, the highest rate in this regard is recorded in Québec, where 86% of deaths occur in the hospital.
With regard to the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report reached conclusions that do not coincide with the position of the Federal Government, which has already declared that it does not wish to amend the Criminal Code in relation to euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to the experts, who have also studied the situation in all countries where such practices have been legalized or do not constitute a criminal offence, there is no evidence that the fact that they are not considered a criminal offence has not led to an abuse of their application, that is, the use of euthanasia or assisted suicide with persons who are not competent or who have not given their consent.
Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, said yesterday by teleconference that, on the contrary, there were more excesses in those countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide have not been legalized.
“Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, although it is clearly illegal.”
“Assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, although it is clearly illegal,” Downie said.
Canadians are in favour of euthanasia
85% of Canadians have already spoken out in favour of euthanasia, as they believe it would allow people whose death is imminent to alleviate their suffering, according to a 2010 Angus Reid survey.
In addition, 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not imply that the lives of the elderly or disabled are less valuable.
As for people who have practiced assisted suicide, 41% of respondents believe that a lawsuit should not be initiated against them.
In relation to the maintenance or interruption of health care to a patient, the situation is not so clear, according to the authors of the report.
In addition, its recommendations suggest that the Criminal Code should indicate that the withdrawal of health care, if it has been legally refused, does not constitute a criminal offence.
The expert committee also calls for health professionals to be trained in the duty to respect the fact that a patient refuses assistance at the end of his life without fear of facing a complaint.
On palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, and not just in cases of cancer.
Finally, in relation to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the committee calls for it, unless it serves to reduce physical pain, to be considered euthanasia and undergo the same procedures.
Other experts express reservations
Other experts in the field of health law have already expressed reservations about the findings of the Royal Society of Canada expert report.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has described as "extreme" the position of the experts who sign the report, among other things because the practice of euthanasia is not limited to the terminally ill.
"This leaves the door open to a situation in which someone who is tired of living and is over 18 years old can ask for help to commit suicide," says Deschamps, who consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
Mr Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report seem to give priority to personal autonomy over any other value in society.
However, he adds that “in society, there are labels and limitations.”
Health law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed “strong opposition” to the report’s findings, which she called a “manifesto in favor of euthanasia.”
Margaret Somerville, who is also a member of the Royal Society of Canada, especially questions the lack of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, such as the Netherlands and Oregon.
Jordan’s King urges President Assad to step down
Damascus denounces "conspiracy"
Syria is becoming increasingly isolated.
The partisans of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday in front of the building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday the diplomatic pressure on Syria of Bashar Assad intensified, which, with the support of Russia, resists it and denounces that there is a "plot" against the country.
Two days after the Arab League's suspension of Syria, the European Union has tightened sanctions on Damascus, while Syria's neighbors Turkey and Jordan have spoken out in favor of President Assad's relinquishment of power.
Jordan’s King Abdullah II was the first Arab leader to call on President Bashar al-Assad to “leave power” in Syria, where some 40 civilians and members of the regime’s forces have already died.
“If Bashar really cares about his country, he should resign, in addition to creating the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life,” the king said in an interview with the BBC.
For his part, the head of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, has regretted that the mediation efforts that Turkey has been carrying out since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have ended in failure.
"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said, referring to Syria, a neighboring country on which Turkey is taking an increasingly tough stance.
For its part, following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union, the United States has welcomed the “strengthening of consensus against Assad and the actions of the regime” in Syria.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and other countries, such as Turkey, are taking an increasingly harsh tone" regarding the crackdown in Syria, said Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of regime forces have already lost their lives in the Deraa region of southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH) has announced.
Two other civilians have died "during shelling and shooting with heavy machine guns in Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, the NGO said.
During a press conference, the Syrian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Walid Al Mualem, considers for his part that the country is "advancing towards the end of the crisis".
In addition, it has reacted strongly to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus from its functions, which in its view is "a dangerous step".
Syria "will not falter," he added, assuring that "plots hatched against Syria will fail."
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently studying a “civilian protection mechanism” and wants to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
The French Minister of Foreign Affairs, Alain Juppé, has also expressed his support for sending UN observers to help protect civilians in the face of the regime's repression, which, in his opinion, is locked in "paranoia".
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled to be held tomorrow in Rabat to finalize the implementation of the plan to end the crisis adopted on 2 November, which provides, in particular, for the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities in the hands of the opposition and the release of the detained demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Thursday called the Arab League’s decision “incorrect,” while China urged Syria to implement the plan to exit the crisis, although it did not express its support for the application of possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti asks for time from markets and sacrifices from Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked for some time from the markets to form his team and launch a program that will include "sacrifice" aimed at regaining the credibility lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner discussed yesterday with the political parties and today met with the trade unions and employers.
It should form a relatively restricted cabinet, composed of technocrats external to Parliament.
"Monti has spoken of a broad programme with numerous sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, a lawmaker from one of the many small parliamentary groups that took part in the meetings, after meeting with the Council President-designate.
For his part, the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, has said that he expects Mario Monti to request a vote of confidence in Parliament before Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultations will end with the presentation by Mr Monti of a limited list, no doubt of a dozen Ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Monti has commented on the nervousness of stock markets and bondholders yesterday, asking them for time.
In "democracy, there are precise deadlines" to form a government and prepare its program, he stressed, adding that he is "sure that the markets will have patience and will understand."
His appointment by the President initially won the approval of the markets, but then there was concern, particularly after an unexpected drop in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The prime minister-designate should create a team made up mainly of technocrats, even if he has stressed that he would like to include "politicians".
The new government will have to function until 2013, the date of the next legislative elections, he considers.
According to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will get the vote of confidence from the Parliament before Friday.
Monti has pledged that, when he takes office, he will work with urgency and with the aim of Italy "regaining its prominence" in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy will not change".
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its goal of achieving a balanced budget in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, has called for the adoption of new rigorous measures.
Italy's "chief of staff" Emma Marcegaglia, who will see him mates, also insisted on the need to boost the economy, "since a country that does not grow can not meet the requirements on deficit".
Monti, famous for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change of era" for Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism"; the "professor" symbolizes "the challenge of seriousness" and "another Italy", according to the editorialists.
The big unknown will be the longevity of your team.
President Napolitano wants to avoid an early election, since Italy has to put some 200 billion euros in government bonds before April 2012.
A Russian scientist has collaborated with the Iranian nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has collaborated with Iran in the development of a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, an American NGO specializing in atomic risk said on Monday.
For the identification of the researcher, the Institute of Science and International Security (ISIS) relies on a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents issued by the UN agency.
The IAEA said last week it was "gravely concerned" about a "possible military dimension" to Iran's nuclear program.
According to ISIS, based extensively on IAEA documents, Danilenko, born in 1934, had worked for three decades, since the 1960s, at a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Ural) and had participated in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the center to form a company focused on the production of "nanodiamonds" in Kiev.
The economic problems of his company would have led him to contact, in 1995, the Embassy of Iran in Ukraine.
Later, he is believed to have cooperated with the Iranian program between 1996 and 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA mentions that there are "clear indications that Iran is developing" a nuclear detonation system "with the help of a foreign expert, who not only knew the technique well, but also, as reported by a member state to the Agency, worked for most of his career in such technology in the military nuclear program of his country of origin."
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by 50%
Crimes and offenses against Muslims have increased nearly 50 percent between 2009 and 2010, while, over the same period, the remaining types of racial and religious violence have decreased or increased only slightly, according to statistics released by the FBI on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of acts of violence committed against Muslims has increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e., it has increased by 49 per cent, compared to a 13 per cent rise in acts of violence against Catholics, a 4 per cent reduction in crimes against Jews and an overall 14 per cent increase in the number of crimes and anti-religious crimes.
The total number of “hate crimes” has grown slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3 percent are due to racial differences and 20 percent to religious differences, according to the FBI.
“After a decline in 2009, it is worrying that such crimes and crimes have increased again,” Human Rights First said in a statement, adding that “the increase in acts of violence against Muslims is especially significant.”
“Human Rights First has long pointed out that violence against Muslims, as well as all types of hate crimes, should be considered a serious human rights violation,” said Paul Legendre, Amnesty International’s Director General.
“The U.S. government can and should strive to end such abuses,” he adds, noting that such efforts could include improving police reporting on “hate crimes.”
The “hate crime” in U.S. federal law was inherited from the time of the civil rights struggle.
This legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence linked to race, skin color, religion, origin and, now, sexual inclination.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The microblogging site Twitter on Monday modified the presentation of its platform to allow its users, in particular, to observe the activity of the people they follow, which makes its service look a little more like that of Facebook.
A new tab "activity" and another called "name" allow to follow more legibly and live the activity of other "Twitters", that is, of those Internet users whose messages ("tweets") follow on the Internet or who follow you.
This allows you to know if they follow up on messages, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they rate a message as a favorite, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "with a small percentage of users in August" before spreading it to the rest of the network on Monday, said Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known for its little instinctive functioning, with slightly esoteric terms (RT to forward a message from another person, followfriday to recommend to follow another user) making the insiders happy, opens up to a wider audience with a handling more comparable to that of the consumer networks Facebook and Google+.
On the network, users have debated the interest of this innovation with "tweets" with different opinions.
“It’s useless, invasive and looks too much like Facebook,” writes <0x40>jemb123.
“The Activity feature is going to help me better follow some elements of my Twitter feed,” <0x40>dannykronstrom writes.
Austria
Introduction of a Budgetary "Golden Rule" in the Constitution
Austria’s ruling Social-Democratic/Christian-Democratic grand coalition government decided on Tuesday to include in the constitution a budgetary “golden rule” to reduce the public deficit and thus prevent a possible downgrade of Austria’s sovereign rating by credit rating agencies (triple A).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor himself, Werner Faymann, who announced this decision after a Council of Ministers, when the Austrian public debt reached 74.6%, a figure much higher than the 60% ceiling set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly lower than the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
“If Austria’s solvency were to be reduced by a single level, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay an additional €3 billion in interest each year,” said Christian Democrat Deputy Foreign Minister Michael Spindelegger.
Austria thus responds to a request from the Brussels Summit of 26 October to the member countries of the euro area: in it, the Heads of State and Government called for the inclusion, before the end of 2012, of the reduction of the public deficit and the recovery of the balance of the public accounts in the Constitution or in a law with equivalent value.
The device adopted by the Austrian government is close to the "German model", since Germany was the first European country to adopt this type of "rule".
Before 2017, the structural public deficit should decrease each year by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) and, from 2017, the structural public deficit of the federal state should not exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while regional states, as well as communes, should present balanced budgets.
The objective is that, by 2020/2021, public debt will be reduced under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty.
A strong yen
Noda threatens new foreign exchange market intervention
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would again intervene in the marking of the change if the yen continued to rise.
"We will intervene, as we did last time, if we see that there is excessive volatility" in the yen exchange rate, Noda told the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose to levels close to the all-time highs that led to the Japanese authorities’ intervention on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo massively sold yen for dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had just hit a new record since 1945 compared to the U.S. currency.
But the yen has been gradually picking up since then, driven by purchases by investors who see it as a “safe haven” in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar was back on Tuesday at less than 77 yen and the euro has fallen below the symbolic bar of 105 yen, reaching levels close to those that caused the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was trading at around 120 yen and the euro at over 160 yen.
This explosion of the Japanese currency hurts the exports of the archipelago, since it makes Made in Japan products more expensive and reduces the value of the income obtained abroad by Japanese companies when they convert them to the national currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild itself" after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated the northeastern region of Tohoku, Noda said, fearing that the yen's rising price will cut the weak recovery.
The world’s third-largest economy picked up growth in the third quarter (1.5 percent compared to the previous quarter), for the first time in a year, thanks to an increase in exports and consumption by households affected by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister believes that the high level of the yen did not reflect Japan's "economic base".
Finance Minister Jun Azumi has called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Council on Tuesday, to take all possible steps to weaken the yen.
However, the institution’s deputy governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken “the right steps,” implying that greater monetary flexibility should not be expected on Wednesday.
During its last meeting at the end of October, the issuing institute increased its purchases of Treasury bills by five trillion yen (47 billion euros), bringing to 55 trillion yen (519 billion euros) the threshold of funds it devotes to the acquisition of various financial securities to flood the liquidity market.
Euro area:
the guys grow, the bags falter
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis continues to hurt European indices.
Despite the appointment of new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy, as well as better growth figures in France and Germany, rates in the weaker countries continue to rise.
Still worried about the stability of the euro zone, European stock markets plunge further into the negative zone on Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris, at 10 o’clock, the CAC 40 lost 1.4% and stood at 3,064 points.
The Dax lost 0.4% in Frankfurt and 0.1% in London.
“Considering the new tensions in relation to the loan yields of the euro area states most affected, stock markets around the world continue to yield part of their recent gains.”
“Investors, nervous, are perfectly aware of the risk of contagion,” Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, told Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange has closed down 0.7%, renewing concerns among market participants about Europe’s ability to contain the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has its sights set on Europe and exchanges will continue to be conducted in a narrow range of variations, so investors will have no evidence that the situation has stabilized,” said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
The resurgence of worries about the future of the euro zone affects the single currency, which continues to decline on Tuesday.
The euro remains at its lowest level for a month and a half.
By 10 a.m., the European currency was worth $1.3570, down 0.4%.
According to the brokers, it has lost value after the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, the CDU, which met on Monday in Congress, adopted a motion that provides, in particular, the option of a country in difficulties to leave the euro area without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates far exceed 6%
Credit rates in Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
On Tuesday morning, the yield on Italian 10-year bonds reached 6.85%, while Spanish bonds on the same term offered 6.2%.
These tensions in relation to the interest rates of the southern countries, but also of France, continue to feed the fears of the interveners.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for time to improve the situation in Italy, which risks suffocating with the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, for his part, has affirmed that the implementation of the decisions adopted at the Euro Area Summit on 27 October would be the "main work" of his Government.
Spain is in the spotlight of the markets, while on Sunday the legislative elections will be held there.
The spread between 10-year bonds in Germany and Spain has reached a new all-time high.
Awaiting euro area growth figures
From a statistical point of view, France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, i.e. a more favourable figure than the 0.3% forecast, driven by domestic consumption.
Insee, however, has revised down the second quarter figure, with a 0.1% reduction in gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
In addition, the fourth quarter is the one that economists are really worried about.
Germany, for its part, has registered a growth of 0.5% in the same period.
The first forecasts for the euro area as a whole are expected at 11 a.m., after the European Commission warned of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts must be worth more than dogmas.
If there’s one issue that can’t be addressed with short-term considerations or just thinking about emotions, it’s energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly influence the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is appropriate that an election meeting should be the time to reflect on such issues and on the place of nuclear energy.
The debate will only be useful if it considers the overall economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, on rational data.
Now that we are 7 billion people on the planet, the demographic evolution will mean the doubling of electricity demand before 2050, unless a huge part of the world population is deprived of a vital element.
At the same time, the growing scarcity of fossil resources will have to be alleviated in order to continue producing electricity continuously, without forgetting the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to fight climate change, an issue that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains alone in its decision to give up nuclear energy.
This is not the case either for Belgium, which subjects its own to the need to find a source capable of replacing it, or for Switzerland, which only aims to build state-of-the-art power plants.
On the other hand, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name a few, are moving forward with their projects with determination.
The United States, for its part, after Fukushima decided to add a unit to its park, resuming the construction of a power plant interrupted after the accident on Three Mile Island.
If the German model, based on renewable energies, is sometimes presented as an example, reality goes against such a discourse.
The election of Berlin will mean a rise in the price of electricity, greater energy dependence due to the increased need for imported gas, in particular from Russia, an increase in CO2 emissions from the construction of gas and coal plants.
In a few months, the harmful effects will be noticed.
The case of Denmark should be considered.
European champion in the wind sector, from which it gets 30% of its electricity, it is also one of the big users of coal and gas due to the intermittency of the wind; for this reason, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the constancy of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill than French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of the maintenance of industrial utility in the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For that reason, any significant reduction in nuclear power would mean a sharp rise in the price of electricity, which would detract from the wonderful statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defense of our purchasing power.
This is a price that the vast majority of French people refuse to pay and, in fact, do not express opposition on principle to this type of energy, according to surveys.
Let us remember that the energy policy of our country has lost building an industrial sector with 125,000 managerial jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Broadly export-oriented, it encompasses a galaxy of SMEs specialized in international markets and that can create non-delocalizable jobs.
If France decided to abandon nuclear energy, it would mean the sacrifice of a large part of these SMEs and the loss of 6 billion euros per year in French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
Which electrician would order an EPR designed to run for sixty years, when the collapse of its manufacturer is expected?
To solve the equation of nuclear energy, we must admit that there is no miraculous source of electricity production, just as there is no diabolical source.
Areva’s development of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementary nature of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is essential to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have a Security Authority that exercises strict and transparent control over both the existing power plants and the construction of Flamanville.
Our teams, of recognized professionalism, are also obsessed with safety.
In half a century, the nuclear sector has suffered three serious accidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, occurred under normal operating conditions; it had no consequences for people or the environment.
At Chernobyl, the accident was due to reactor design and unforgivable human failures.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was due to two natural disasters of unprecedented scope, which resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear sector will learn from this accident, just as it did from the previous two.
Thanks to this progress and to a cooperation between the safety authorities, and the French and German operators and constructors, the EPR presents a design capable of resisting such phenomena.
While it is studied by all the electrical players who want to build a power plant, the interruption of its construction in Flamanville would be a great gift for the competitors of Areva and EDF, since it would leave them free to take the lead in the inevitable development of the nuclear sector.
It is indispensable and legitimate to seek the best energy options for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotion, dogmas and partisan maneuvers dominate such an important debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration, a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy applied by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various points of view: the saturation of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the figures policy, the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of "country of human rights" of France.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students that has made headlines, with the Minister of the Interior (see the newspaper Libération of May 23) proclaiming in the past that France "does not need foreign talents, workers or waiters".
However, it is rarely analyzed from an economic point of view.
The point is that, on this issue, there is quite a consensus between the left and the right.
In the case of the right, Jacques Chirac set the guideline stating in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem for a country that has about two million immigrant workers", while on the left, the tone was set by Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot take over all the misery in the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, both left and right shared the fear of invasion of the national territory by a crowd of Polish plumbers.
On both sides, immigrants are seen as a burden on the French economy and society.
The only difference is in the degree of generosity with which they act with respect to immigrants.
In his program, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande limits himself to including banalities, indicating that co-development will allow to solve the "problem of migration".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be profitable electorally, but economically it is very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in a recent work summarizing the latest knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among scholars on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages, and employment in the countries that receive them.
Limiting immigration weakens growth and hurts jobs.
Fears related to the impact of immigrants are based on the idea that they can replace domestic workers, particularly the low-skilled, by pushing for lower wages.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are more complementary than substitutes for national workers and mainly work in sectors with a lack of employment.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract domestic workers and the more skilled in dynamic sectors where training does not meet the demand for staff.
A positive effect on wages
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country that lacks anesthesiologists, the complementarity between nationals and immigrants causes the arrival of the latter to positively influence the salaries and employment of nationals.
Given the above, Giovanni Peri calculated that a 1% increase in migratory flows means a rise in real long-term wages of between 0.6 and 0.9%.
And, regardless of the fact that the diversity that immigrants bring contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (there is a large proportion of naturalized American Nobel laureates and companies such as Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Immigrants are also net contributors to social systems, contributing on average 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The International Labour Organization estimates, for example, that in Germany an immigrant arriving at the age of 30 will make a net contribution (income minus expenses) of 150,000 euros to public budgets on average throughout his life.
At the beginning of his mandate, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go and look for the points of growth that he was missing "with his teeth".
These teeth, which deterred immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, all it needs to do is think about a European democracy
Democracy is a precious good, but also a fragile one.
The European continent should be able to remember this because, although it was invented in Athens more than two thousand years ago, throughout the twentieth century it has suffered the tragedies of World War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some perhaps believed that, for democracy to triumph definitively over its enemies, it would be sufficient to exercise the vote and in the most direct way possible.
We know, since Napoleon "the Little", that it was something thought.
Universal suffrage, although a necessary condition for democracy, is not enough on its own and can even become an "instrument of oppression", as the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and control of powers, an education, Lights, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis we are experiencing in Europe is an economic crisis, but it is about to become a political and democratic crisis.
The palinody of the true-false Greek referendum had, in this respect, a double revealing effect: it showed the need for a powerful return of the political sphere, but also the worrying sense of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
This ambivalence must be reflected upon in order to overcome it.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic battle have now shifted and that, in many cases, Republican soldiers are no longer moving in the right direction.
We will not win if we demand a succession of national referendums, organized according to needs and in a disorderly way.
A blank signature to the absolute European monarch or a vacuum stop of the nationalist hole: what options for the citizen!
No, we do not want to draw blows of effect, but a common, full-fledged, calm and continuous exercise of options and democracy, this time on a European scale.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (in fact, we would not know where to end the list), because there is only one crisis, the crisis of Europe.
The whole of Europe is the one that bends to the orders of the markets and rating agencies, the one that suffers from its impotence and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is being humiliated in the international arena.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but it is all of Europe that is slowly losing sovereignty and, with it, each of its nations.
What is most urgent is for popular sovereignty to regain the helm of the European project.
Because only together will Europeans be able to reduce the burden of their debts, free themselves from the markets and prepare their future through investments.
Exiting the crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, unless it is to lead us to disaster.
Having fought for a long time against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone is now calling for European economic governance.
So be it.
But to think about it without greater political and democratic integration, and without it being lived as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and would lead us to a new deadlock.
We must take on a new stage of European construction.
To build the Republic in France, it was necessary to “make” Republicans.
Interest-driven revolution would not be enough.
This lesson still applies.
We must build a more economically integrated Europe.
It can only be achieved by building a more democratic Europe at the political level, a true European people's sovereignty.
To build Europe, let us make Europeans.
"Contactless" chip cards become widespread
The global chip card show kicks off Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, with an upbeat atmosphere.
In fact, the year 2011 should end with an 11% increase in global sales of cards with microprocessors (bank cards, phones with SIM cards, etc.), with a total of 6 billion units, according to calculations of the cabinet Eurosmart.
The most powerful segment is that of contactless technology, which makes it possible to pay for public transport or purchases simply by bringing the card closer to a reader.
460 million contactless chip cards will be sold worldwide this year, 320 million more than the previous year!
Its share is expected to increase further in 2012 (580 million units) and account for about 10 per cent of the global chip card market (6.925 million cards).
Europe, which has long lagged behind the Asia-Pacific region, is gaining ground in the contactless payment sector.
About 26 million Visa bank cards already have this feature, which is accepted at 75,000 payment terminals.
In France, its beginnings are more modest: 400,000 contactless Visa cards are being used.
But large stores work for four.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million contactless MasterCard Pass cards this year.
To get the top gear, however, it is necessary that banks make them available to their customers.
“There are two large French establishments that have committed to systematically disseminating contactless bank cards to their customers in the future,” said Gérard Nébouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks test mobile phone payment
But it is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
At present, there are few devices equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology, essential to carry out transactions.
"They're falling behind."
“But I should finally experience a real boom next year.”
“We expect between 80 and 120 million units to be sold in 2012 worldwide,” explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks are taking the lead.
The bank Crédit agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test between December and next June in Caen.
The iPhones of about 200 customers and collaborators will be equipped with a case that allows contactless payment.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société Générale has also said yesterday that it is preparing to market an offer that allows its customers to pay contactless through their mobile.
From the Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is on the rise
Paris is concerned about links between al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long-suspected links between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and the Nigerian sect of Boko Haram have been confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even claimed that Algiers already "has the certainty".
"The way in which both organizations operate and the intelligence reports show that they are cooperating," he said, without elaborating.
Paris seems to reach a similar conclusion.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger last January would have resumed the catwalks.
Kidnapped at a Niamey restaurant by people connected to AQIM, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were killed the next day along with several of their kidnappers during an operation launched by French special forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators discovered several phone chips that belonged to the terrorists.
Terrorist Axis
The study of the calls made indicates to several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two issues especially captured the interest of the researchers: one leads to a Nigerian who remained for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the birthplace of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who, allegedly, is close to Aqmi and the sect.
“This is progress, but we should certainly wait for more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between AQIM and Boko Haram.”
"But it is possible."
“We have known for years that the sect enjoys outside financial and intellectual support and that it is increasingly active,” said Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, such “supports” had become increasingly evident in the evolution and discourses of Boko Haram or in its modes of operation, which now involve the use of kamikazes or explosive devices increasingly complex and in the same style as those used by AQIM.
The international community, starting with Washington, has since been pressuring Abuja to take into account the problems generated by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities, in fact, have long regarded the group as an uninteresting enlightened community.
A quick success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram (meaning, in Hausa, "Western education is a sin"), incites the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is experiencing rapid success.
It politicizes itself and demands strict respect for sharia, while its militants throw themselves into the fight against the godless central government.
The latter are primarily oriented to churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram militants were particularly active and attacks on police stations increased.
Abuja’s reaction was, as usual, widespread.
The army attacked the city and 800 people were killed.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested alive, receives death in prison.
Since then, the sect has radicalized and abandoned its northern fiefdoms.
Last Christmas, claims an attack that causes 80 deaths in Jos and, later, another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram again attacked Abuja, particularly the protected police headquarters, with a suicide attack, the first of its kind.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations becomes its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which would range from Mauritania to Somalia to Nigeria, is of concern to all security specialists.
While AQIM has attacked Mali and Niger and Al-Chebab Somalis are operating in Kenya, Boko Haram is emerging as a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned him against Boko Haram and said he was willing to "share all the information".
The World According to Republican Presidential Candidates
In relation to China, Iran and aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry rival each other in simplicity and lack of knowledge.
Can an America weakened by the crisis manage a complex world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
Listening to the Republican presidential candidates, voters might think so.
For a few days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other candidates are making more and more thunderous statements and shortcuts in foreign policy, traditionally a strong point of the Republicans.
Slogans, often unfounded, spread over China, Iran, aid to Israel.
Mitt Romney, the best-placed candidate in the race for the "Grand Old Party" nomination, has threatened to take the Chinese to the WTO and denounce them "for currency manipulation," a key issue in an America exasperated by the migration of entire chunks of its sector to Asia.
It doesn’t matter if that means an explosion of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama’s former ambassador to China and the only candidate with a sophisticated view of foreign policy, is almost drowning in an attitude that “disappoints” emotions.
He has called for a firm, but constructive, dialogue with Beijing (Obama’s current position).
But Huntsman, who remains stuck in the depths of the probes, remains inaudible.
In the style of Reagan
Romney has also promised military intervention in Iran if sanctions fail to disrupt its nuclear program.
“If I get elected, I will stop Iran,” he boasted.
“If Obama gets re-elected, they’ll have the bomb.”
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of having failed in his obligations to that partner.
The businessman Herman Cain, the second best-ranked candidate, shows a shameful ignorance of such issues.
Recently, he urged countering the Chinese military threat because Beijing is “trying to develop nuclear capability,” apparently ignoring the fact that China has had the military atom since 1964.
Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, says he, for his part, is willing to deploy the U.S. military in Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
The differences are considerable with the 2008 Republican nominee, John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
Opponents of the current president argue that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They remember that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to loosen the piston in the fight against terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of their na<0xC3><0xAF>ve dialogue with Iran, on the hasty departure of the “boys” from Iraq and on their misrepresentations in Libya, and label it as weak.
But the attacks are not easy for them.
The population judges in a rather positive way the national security balance of Obama, who ended bin Laden.
From Iraq, he is wary of military interventions that cause a collapse.
And, arguing that America needs to be rebuilt economically to resuscitate his leadership, Obama gives the impression of being more just.
Nord Stream, Russia’s new gas gateway to Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which directly connects Western Europe with Russia through the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has already been put into service.
It must supply gas to meet the needs of thirty million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with great pomp.
Last Tuesday, more than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, took part on the shores of the Baltic, between the music of the orchestra and a delicate buffet, in the inauguration of the Nord Stream, the new gas pipeline that communicates directly, under the sea, Russia with Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon and their Dutch counterpart, Mark Rutte, have turned together the flywheel of the valve that controls the entry of Russian gas into the Western European grid.
With this new pipeline, each year an additional 27.5 million cubic meters of Russian gas will reach Western Europe through a first run of 1,224 km connecting the region of St. Petersburg with the Land of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
A second pipe should be completed by the end of 2012 that will supply a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, that is, enough to cover all French consumption.
In addition, there is already talk of the possibility of building a third tube along the same route.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this enormous work presents an air of victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries had strongly opposed the project.
In fact, the Nord Stream will allow gas to be supplied directly to Germany, avoiding overland transit by third countries (Poland and Ukraine).
Suddenly, these two countries lose some of their power: for them, it will be more difficult to influence Russia by threatening to close access to the markets of Western Europe.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the Nord Stream as a "new German-Soviet pact", in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is, if the issue is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, supporting the Russian project, has obtained greater security of supply.
But the price is a weakening of the energy Europe, given that the project has generated a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
In just five years, Russia has succeeded in achieving its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, major consumers of gas and with increasingly limited reserves.
“This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that unites us in an organic way,” Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon confirmed during the pipeline’s inauguration, demonstrating the extent to which major contracts in the gas sector are as political as they are economic.
All this explains the wide smiles on the faces of Gazprom executives, numerous in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also a technical achievement.
The submarine tube is made of cement-coated steel to protect it against the anchors of ships.
It rests on the seabed, at an average depth of 200 m.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating back to World War II.
"A hundred of them had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution," said Jens M<0xC3><0xBC>ller, a spokesman for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to extend measures for the protection of fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake that weighs like 242 Eiffel towers and is not interrupted in its entire length: neither by valves, nor by maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned in Swedish waters, but the project gave it up as the Swedes were not very willing to allow a Russian state-owned company to settle permanently at sea off their coasts.
“In the event of a breakdown, we will interrupt the passage of the gas in less than a minute,” says Jens M<0xC3><0xBC>ller.
In the event of a leak, the gas from the pipeline will therefore be released into the atmosphere.
But builders consider it unlikely that a leak will occur, as they have predicted joints that are expected to leak every 100,000 years.
Control of the state of the pipeline is ensured by an underwater robot, drawn by a vessel, which performs external inspections, as well as by a device circulating inside the pipeline.
With the shape of a cigar, it is introduced inside the tube, which has a diameter of one meter, and moves with the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of three meters per second, it provides accurate data on possible deformations of the metal.
The pipeline has been designed to run for fifty years without the need for any repairs.
The circulation of the gas is guaranteed simply by the pressure.
At the beginning it is 200 bars and, at the exit of 100 bars.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leading company is Gazprom, which owns 51% of the shares.
It was joined by Germany’s E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Netherlands’ Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have set up a joint venture, called Nord Stream, to build and operate the pipeline.
It is based in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
After that, Gazprom leased to that company, for a renewable period of twenty-five years, the entire gas transmission capacity.
“Gazprom will pay for the full capacity, regardless of how much gas is actually transported,” says Jens M<0xC3><0xBC>ller.
The financing of the construction of the gas pipeline has been carried out in 30% with the contribution of the shareholders and in 70% through bank loans.
The total cost of the work should reach 7.4 billion euros for the two pipes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment has reached 240 million.
But minority shareholders are confident that they will not exceed their investment, as Gazprom alone bears the risk of expenses.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic in Lubmin, on a sandy coast planted with pine trees.
Valves, 4.5 meters high, form the exit door of the gas.
There are sensors that measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas on arrival, before it is transferred to German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
At full capacity, it will be three million per hour and in 2012, six million.
Moleskine, a branded notebook.
Created half a century ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to give people back the taste for writing.
It has an air of adventure, of hours of writing by candlelight.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognized, with its black rectangular pastes, its rubber, its broken white leaves, as aged by time.
However, Moleskine notebooks with the current look were born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at that time to launch a notebook of design notes, but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant for the company, was in charge of the launch of the new product.
The notebook is inspired by an ancient production technique, mole skin, which refers to a varnished cotton that was used, among other things, to cover the stools.
This type of notebook was highly valued by writers and travelers.
“Moleskine has adapted an old and forgotten object, an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century, to today’s taste,” says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become responsible for the brand in Modo Modo.
And he achieved success.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26%, reaching a volume of 12.7 million units sold.
Far away is the confidential production of the first years, in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine goes beyond Italian borders and exports its products to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to determine the profile of the buyer, since the notebook attracts both businessmen and students and professionals.
Like Moleskine, its users are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultured.
The small Italian company, which had twelve workers at the beginning, now has about 100 and, since 2008, has two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
He distributes his notebooks in bookstores, from Fnac to small shops in the center of the cities, and has been able to impose his identity.
“We have adapted to the times and the need to write, despite the boom in emails,” explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature goes hand in hand with the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand has launched the exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists exhibit their own notebook.
In August, he also released a notebook with leopard covers, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: bags, agendas, pens, computer cases... The brand covers a wide range of media.
An envious success: in autumn 2006, Modo Modo was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, thus writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate for disabled workers still so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for a job.
The 15th Disability Employment Week begins today.
Despite a determined public policy, implemented since 2005, the unemployment rate among disabled people doubles the average rate: 19 per cent, compared to 9 per cent for the population as a whole.
Discouraging?
“No,” says <0xC3><0x89>ric Blanchet, CEO of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of the disabled.
"The progress made over the past 15 years is considerable.
“Back then, the unemployment rate was not twice but three times higher than the average.
“However, there is still a lot to be done.”
It is worth mentioning that the disabled unemployed continue to face numerous obstacles to access employment.
They tend to be older: 37% are over 50 years old (on average 17%).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% have not completed high school and, of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is widespread among them: 53% for the disabled, compared to 38% on average.
That is to say, there are numerous issues that make it particularly difficult to return to the world of work and that “constitute the crux of the problem”, points out Christian Grapin, CEO of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
These are the objective obstacles.
In addition, there are those who are not mentioned; the mentality of people advances, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entreprendre association for the Cité noted that the directors surveyed have "a low level of knowledge about disabilities", with an "excessive representation of people in wheelchairs, physically or intellectually disabled".
The result: private companies with more than 20 workers are far from the target of hiring 6% of disabled workers, a target that was set in a 1987 law.
According to the latest available figures, which date from 2008, they reach a ratio of 2.6%.
"Now we have about 3%," says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the body responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not respect this law.
The proof: the number of establishments "subject to this contribution", as well as the amounts disbursed, have decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
“The 2005 law, which increased contributions, has created a great deal of pressure for companies,” explains Pierre Blanc.
“But this improvement also reflects real awareness, particularly among large groups.”
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of companies with between 20 and 49 workers have disabled employees in their workforce, compared to 82% of companies with between 100 and 199 workers.
Hazard: "A Joy"
About to face the Bleus on Tuesday night (8:45 p.m.), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens do not hide the pleasure generated by this friendly match.
We will not dare to say that there was collusion between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting next to each other on the stage of the Stade de France auditorium, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have really made up.
Five months after his striker’s grudge against Turkey, the Belgian coach has nothing but praise for him.
“I was very happy for Eden, for her progress and because she is Belgian.”
"I want to move forward," the Lille striker replies.
As for the contrast between his presentations in his team and in the selection, "it is a set", it has been justified.
“In Lille, I’m all year round, which doesn’t apply to Belgium.
"I have to settle down."
Convened to play against Romania on Friday night, considering this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "shine".
Not to mention “pleasure.”
He has been cheering on the Bleus since he was seven, as well as during the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
“I’ve always been his fan,” he says.
This will certainly reinforce the "particular" character of the meeting.
Especially because he will face "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)," he recalls.
“We just faced each other recently.
"Playing against them is always a joy."
With simplicity, Leekens has for his part made reference to "pride".
"Pride" for playing "a gala match".
"Pride" also to check, as "neighbor", that France "returns to be a team of very high level", about a year after the trauma of Knysna.
“Laurent Blanc has done a formidable job,” he said enthusiastically.
While Belgium will not attend the next European competition, the coach would be delighted to be able to share a plane with the Bleus towards... Brazil, in 2014.
“Our little Belgians are growing up,” he said.
“We’re building something; the players are ambitious, they’re hungry.
"You'll be able to see him in the next few matches." Including the match against France.
Portugal shows a lot of confidence
Paulo Bento’s Portugal face with great optimism the second leg against Bosnia (22:00), which will be held on Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the first leg, both teams lacked realism.
“When these 90 minutes pass, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country.”
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
There is no doubt about it; the national team, which has been in charge since September 2010, will qualify for the Euro 2012.
Indeed, just 90 minutes separate Portugal from happiness.
But there is a game to play and a rival, Bosnia, to beat.
Considering the first leg match (0-0), on Friday in Zenica hell, it seems obvious that the matter is not decided.
Portugal dominated the match for more than an hour, yes, but could not score the valuable goal that would have given them peace of mind.
“It’s a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, since we haven’t scored away from home.”
But at home, in Lisbon’s luminous Estadio de la Luz, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, before an audience that should be just as enthusiastic, even if it is clear that the match “is very evenly matched,” said an optimistic but lucid Bento.
"We hope that the match is very even, but we are completely convinced that we can take the lead," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance of participating in the Euro 2012," has, however, relativized the successor of Carlos Queiroz.
Friday’s draw in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
The Bosnians could get a draw, but they also need to score.
“It’s a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, since we haven’t scored away from home,” said Bento.
"We are going to play against a team that has a great technical quality and has players with a great individual quality," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will go with the intention of exerting, from the beginning, maximum pressure on the Bosnians to "not leave them time to think".
A good idea, as long as, this time, it's realistic.
