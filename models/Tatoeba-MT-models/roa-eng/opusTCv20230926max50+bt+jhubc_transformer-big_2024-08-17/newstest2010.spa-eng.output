Barack Obama will be the fourth U.S. president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
U.S. President Barack Obama will arrive in Oslo, Norway to spend 26 hours and receive the Nobel Peace Prize, as the fourth American president in history.
The $1.4 million diploma, medal and cheque will be awarded, among other things, for outstanding efforts in strengthening global diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The White House chief and his wife Michelle will arrive in the Norwegian metropolis in the morning and have a lot to do.
First, visit the Nobel Institute, where for the first time he will meet the five members of the committee that, in October, elected him from 172 people and 33 organizations.
Afterwards, the presidential couple is scheduled to meet with the King of Norway, Harald V, and Queen Sonia.
In the afternoon the visit will culminate with a ceremony in which Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth U.S. president to receive it, though the third to receive it in office.
The White House has already announced that, upon receiving the award, it will talk about the Afghan war.
The President does not want to avoid this issue, knowing that he is receiving the award as president of a country that is currently at war in two countries.
Their war efforts increased further with the dispatch of additional troops to Afghanistan, which does not forget to mention any of their critics.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive the gold medal, diploma and check for ten million Swedish kronor (approximately 24 million Czech kronor).
It proposes to donate them for charitable purposes, but has not yet decided to which organization in particular.
During his full program, the President and his wife will participate in a banquet attended by the Norwegian kings, the Prime Minister and 250 other guests.
Obama from the beginning had a rather reserved attitude toward the award.
He mentioned, for example, having the feeling that he didn’t deserve it at all.
He also repeated several times that the prize is not only for him, but for all those who fight for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement he mentioned that it represents "a challenge to take action."
Nature advocate accused of blackmail
Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice police accused the president of the civic association Spole<0xC4><0x8D>nost ochránc<0xC5><0xAF> p<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>rody Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice (Society of Nature Defenders Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice) of blackmail.
Last year he appealed several times against some construction licensing procedures and to withdraw appeals he demanded money from investors for his own benefit, Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice police spokeswoman Alena Romová said.
The president of the Society of Nature Advocates Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice is Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ka.
He is currently in detention and faces a sentence of up to three years in prison.
Brno doesn't like containers too much to separate garbage
In Prague, citizens can separate beverage packaging and in the villages of southern Moravia containers can be found to separate garbage everywhere.
What about Brno?
It takes several minutes to find the respective containers.
I do not want to say that in Brno the garbage is not separated at all.
It seems to me that, to be the second largest city in the Republic, the municipalities are not interested enough in this problem.
Brno is totally behind in the separation of waste, not only because we citizens can only use containers to separate paper, glass and plastic, but above all because of the number of containers for such waste.
Have you ever tried, for example, to throw a PET bottle in the middle of the right container?
It is almost impossible, above all it requires a lot of time and patience.
The only place I have found so far is in Moravské nám<0xC4><0x9B>st<0xC3><0xAD> square, in front of the Potrefená Huse.
Don't let Mr. Onderka and his colleagues get mad at me, but that seems too little to me.
Needless to say, in other places it is not easy to separate the garbage either.
That’s why many of my friends prefer not to separate it.
By vagrancy
The containers are far away.
I'm not surprised.
I myself offered, after a party, to throw away several glass and plastic bottles.
But on Kaunicova Street I did not see any red container nearby.
Fortunately, going to the tram I found the right place.
However, the garbage was already overflowing from the container.
It’s still the center of Brno, the most representative part of the city, isn’t it?!
What happens is that ecology and aesthetics do not seem to interest the Brno socialists too much.
They prefer to buy the city the extra hockey league, which shames us all over the republic, and not to buy more containers or offer the separation of other materials so that Brno is cleaner.
I am glad to be able to compare my hypothesis, after surfing the Internet a little, with the official statistics.
According to the EKO-KOM society, Brno is truly the worst in the entire Jihomoravsk<0xC3><0xBD> kraj region.
The budget of "Paroubek" took money from rents and sickness benefits
After the left, despite the opinion of the government, added funds for farmers or officials, there may not be enough money in the budget for rents, sickness benefits or construction savings.
But neither for the interests of state debt or international litigation.
This will hurt everyone who governs in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists imposed the increase for some groups, they relied on the government subsequently to borrow for sensitive expenses, rents or sickness benefits. "That only means postponing the problems for the future, it is laying mines," says Janota.
What happens is that, when you borrow money, you have to pay higher and higher interest and, one day, you have to pay the money back.
The state does not have many options to get money.
If it does not reduce social subsidies or state operating expenses, it has to raise taxes.
To everyone the left added now: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And, later, their children too.
People don't have to worry about income or sickness benefits, they'll get them. 1.8 billion of these accounts disappeared.
But the price to be paid will be the increase in public debt; next year not only $163 billion will be missing from the treasury, but more.
Despite Minister Janota’s efforts, the debt will continue to rise along with interest expenses.
The state will need money to cover them and will no longer come up with slightly higher VAT or lower maternity benefits, as the government did in its deficit package.
Due to the dislocations of money for the benefit of some groups of voters, next year will also be missing five billion to finish the construction of highways and railways.
These are, above all, the sectors in which the tender has already been held and where the construction process has already begun, whose projects cannot be changed and their price cannot be reduced either.
The most you can do is keep them, which is also not free.
That means delay or cessation of the thirty large constructions; the possibility of obtaining European funds is also in danger, warns the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
<0xC4><0x8C>SSD proposed a Solomonic solution for the decrease of funds: it will get money from the dividends of <0xC4><0x8C>EZ, which is mostly state-owned, and will add the transport fund.
The problem is that the value of the dividend is never safe nor is it a bottomless pittance.
Last year <0xC4><0x8C>EZ allocated 18 billion to the budget.
Every year, the dividends are paid for ecological damages, they serve to complete the income account or serve as a reserve for the prepared income reform.
In addition, with this trick, according to EU rules, the real budget deficit increases to the level of 5.7% of GDP.
The carnival of money transfers does not end here.
Nearly $3 billion was raised from the budget to grant various compensations to victims of communism and crime, or for litigation expenses, including construction savings.
It is unclear whether the state will need such funds.
It's a lottery.
If we lose any international litigation, we may have to pay for it, says Janota.
Afterwards, the Minister will have to save money within the spring or, in the worst case, use the reserve of the government budget.
One hundred million are also missing for the two billion-dollar Státn<0xC3><0xAD> pokladna (State Box) project, which has already been launched and should allow online monitoring of what the various authorities are spending on.
The first stage starts in January.
If the finance minister does not find the money elsewhere, the project will have to stop and sanctions will come, warns Janota.
Your future smartphone will be able to work with two operating systems
Americans will have a mobile phone in which the user can, by pressing a key, switch between several operating systems.
The plans revealed sound promising.
At the touch of a button, they switch in a few seconds from Windows Mobile to Android.
This possibility is precisely the goal of the American company VMware, which focuses mainly on the development of virtualizing software for computers.
On your mobile you can carry two user profiles at the same time.
They will be able to switch between them and divide them between home and work.
The two operate at the same time, Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware said in an interview with Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and several days ago it was demonstrated for the first time.
It will be launched in 2012.
The virtualization of smartphones is no longer a fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated to journalists how the smartphone works with two operating systems.
It was the Nokia N800, modified with a RAM of 128 MB, where the aforementioned systems, Windows Mobile and Android, work at the same time.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is at its peak.
VMware is cooperating with European and U.S. carriers to test smartphone virtualization, and these phones will reach customers in 2012.
The lack of snow in the mountains worries hoteliers
It’s not just ski lift maintainers in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e who are concerned about snow-free pistes.
The lack of snow means that people do not book ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
Therefore, in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e you can still get free rooms for all winter dates, including Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve.
We have many visitors on our pages.
People look at offers, check prices, but are still afraid to book with commitment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask about our opinion, whether this Christmas there will be snow or mud," said the maintainer of the information portal Spindl.Info Martin Jandura.
Those who want to spend in <0xC5><0xA0>pindler<0xC5><0xAF>v Ml<0xC3><0xBD>n a New Year's Eve according to their expectations, should not hesitate any longer to book the stay.
Those who prefer to save money and put the quality of accommodation second, can try to wait a few more days.
The <0xC5><0xA0>pindler<0xC5><0xAF>v Ml<0xC3><0xBD>n hoteliers mainly offer weekly stays for New Year's Eve.
I think they will continue to offer them, but soon they will give in and offer shorter stays.
And then the free rooms will sell out quickly, Jandura estimated.
Ingotours, a travel agency from Vrchlab<0xC3><0xAD>, continues to offer free beds for all winter dates.
Now what interests us most is the Christmas week, which is not yet complete.
Half of the places offered remain free.
That's why we have already prepared some last-minute Christmas stays," said Ingtours director Petr Schiefert.
Vrchlab<0xC3><0xAD>’s travel agency can still offer New Year’s Eve in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e, but there are fewer places available.
They also sell very well the first fourteen days of February, the remaining winter dates are sold regularly.
This year interest in winter stays is hampered by the lack of snow in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e.
People are waiting to see if there will be snow.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes remain snowy during the week, the Christmas dates will run out as well,” Schiefert says.
On the contrary, it is a little easier to occupy the rooms at the Horizont hotel in Pec pod Sn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>kou; last year it was more difficult.
We're about five percent better.
For New Year's Eve and Christmas, we have the last free places.
Interest increases during the Polish holidays in January and February also sells well," reported the director of the best hotel in Pec, Karel Rada.
Eighty percent of New Year's Eve stays are already occupied at the Omnia hotel, near the central car park in Janské Lázn<0xC4><0x9B>.
On the contrary, at Janské Lázn<0xC4><0x9B>’s most recent hotel at Christmas half of the beds are still free.
This January was a big surprise for us, as we are approximately sixty percent of occupancy capacity.
February has been a bit weaker, but as soon as snow falls, interest in staying in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e will surely increase, said Erik Sporysch, the director of the Omnia hotel.
For now, however, it seems that hoteliers in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e will have a hard time waiting for snow.
On Thursday temperatures should drop and, if there is precipitation, in the mountains should snow.
But then temperatures will rise again, reported Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Jakubsk<0xC3><0xBD> of Hradec Králové, of the Hydrometeorological Institute of the Czech Republic.
Repetition is the Mother of Wisdom
It is funny that Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of the smartest man, as a diligent student repeats in the Afghan question the strategy of his predecessor, which he himself took for the dumbest.
When he finally revealed his eagerly awaited Afghan approach, it was shown to be a copy of the script used for Iraq by Bush, created three years ago.
Not only is the phrase “just like in Iraq” used several times in the same text, but he also did not hesitate to use the title of Bush’s January 2007 statement for his own statement: “A New Way Forward.”
It was Bush himself, who three years ago criticized the idea of sending new military reinforcements to Iraq, the country that is suffering from the civil war, and that criticized it as "an irresponsible decision with catastrophic consequences."
The following months, however, proved that Bush’s strategy, based on the recommendations of field captains, was the only possible and successful one, so that today there is no talk of Iraq in the news.
Bush’s reputation did not improve, however objectively he left his successor in a much more favorable initial situation than expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama is hoping for a repeat of the miracle.
The field captains again asked him to increase the military contingent, especially the commander-in-chief of the Afghan operation General Stanley McCristal. He, even despite the traditional subordinate relations, subjected the indecisive riflemen in the White House to harsh criticism.
He asked for 40,000 men to be able to improve the situation.
The president hesitated for three months, but he couldn’t think of anything better, so at least he fooled the general about 10,000 servicemen.
He managed to get Europe to promise him another 5,000, although he himself previously had at least 10,000.
The most problematic part of Obama’s whole strategy seems to be his goal, to start withdrawing troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and to finish this procedure in three years.
Many doubt that the increase will bear the same fruit as the procedure in Iraq.
Despite fratricidal wars in recent years, Iraq’s society is relatively well organized, its leaders respecting the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is different: no one can be trusted and no agreement is being reached.
Under these conditions it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, if they are accustomed to changing the chief every day according to their needs.
Political institutions, although formally established, will remain only a village of Potemkin, after which patriarchal tribal relations will remain.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extraordinarily complicated due to confusing relationships, further complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Not even setting a state that is “actionable,” a minimum goal of the entire operation, seems very real.
The horizon of Obama’s strategy clashes with his voluntarism.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has continued to worsen and is now about to explode.
Only a romantic soul, who knows nothing of reality, can believe that the military sent to war to "return home soon", will do some miracle here.
From a political point of view, setting the date for the withdrawal of troops is sheer irresponsibility, as the Taliban will regard it as an indirect declaration of American defeat.
The latest NATO summit showed that Europeans are less and less willing to participate in military operations in Afghanistan.
European politicians do not know, and do not want to explain to their constituents, what the security of Germany or Italy has to do with the war with the Hindu Kush.
The other factor, capable of radically affecting the situation, is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to worsen and the increased sanctions have no effect on the Iranians, the US will have to make a difficult decision: to try to solve the problem with military force or not.
It will be necessary to seek the answers precisely when, according to Obama, America begins the triumphant withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
However, each such solution will mean a dramatic setback for the Afghan situation.
The only positive for Barack Obama is the fact that the presidential election is three years away and that is why there is still a long way to go to find another strategy, if this is a total failure.
Goldman Sachs executives will no longer receive cash bonuses
Senior executives at U.S. bank Goldman Sachs will not receive the cash bonuses this year.
The entity announced it to react to harsh criticism of its salary practices.
The group of 30 senior managers will receive, instead of money, shares that cannot be sold in a minimum period of five years.
In addition, the shares may be withdrawn in the event that they have assumed excessive risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs thus became the leader in the effort to unite bonuses on Wall Street with long-term power.
I suppose Wall Street is fully aware of the longer road ahead, said former JPMorgan bank investor Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs faced criticism after setting aside nearly $17 billion (nearly CZK300 billion) for bonuses in the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of bonuses in the entity for this year, according to Reuters, is likely to exceed, despite the measure announced today, 20 billion dollars.
The high bonuses in the banking sector became, with the arrival of the financial crisis, a sensitive issue in politics.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it plans to tax all at once, with a fifty percent tax, bonuses for banks exceeding 25,000 pounds (about 712,000 CZK).
France is also preparing similar measures.
This year women received Nobel Prizes in all categories except Physics
Five women, a record number, received this year’s Nobel Prizes in specialized categories and literature from King Charles XVI Gustaf of Sweden in Stockholm today.
In addition to the four scientists, among the winners was also a German writer of Romanian origin, Herta M<0xC3><0xBC>ller.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, as well as her compatriot Jack Szostak for research in the field of chromosomes.
The Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Israel’s Ada Jonath and Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishna and Thomas Steitz for explaining the structure and function of ribosomes.
The last prize awarded, the Nobel Prize in Economics, was awarded to American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson for the analysis of an economic report.
The only specialized category, without an award-winning woman, was Physics.
This award was received today by scientists Charles Kao for research in the field of optical cables, and George Smith with Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which forms the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or telescopes.
Each laureate collected the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of the money received.
This sum in each category is up to ten million Swedish kroner (approximately 25 million Czech kroner).
If there are several winners in each category, the prize is divided among them.
The long-awaited Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to President Barack Obama in Oslo, Norway.
In his speech he acknowledged the controversy of having been awarded, since he is at the beginning of his career and also is at the head of a country that participates in two wars: in Iraq and Afghanistan.
To defend his policy, he added, however, that in certain situations wars are essential to achieve peace, even if their price is high.
Minister Janota considers resigning. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President Václav Klaus will receive on Friday morning Finance Minister Eduard Janota, who is considering his stay in the government, as he does not agree with the version of the state budget for next year, approved on Wednesday by the Chamber of Deputies.
The budget, and perhaps also Janota’s tenure in the cabinet, are supposed to be the topics of their meeting on Friday.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which continues to deepen the crisis of public finances.
The meeting was reported by the spokesman of President Radim Ochvat.
On his stay in office, Janota wants to negotiate with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday.
According to the law on the budget, prepared to be signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should rule with a deficit of 163 billion kroner.
The chamber of deputies, however, approved on Wednesday the left’s proposals for transfers of funds and increased money for civil servants’ salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government does not agree with the proposals of the Social Democrats, as they covertly increase the budget deficit.
Between the left on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the right on the other, there was a serious conflict of domestic policy. Due to this conflict, the future activities of Fischer’s bureaucratic cabinet, whose form was agreed in spring by the SDGs, <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and the Green Party, begin to be controversial.
Critics claim that the budget, in the version approved by the Chamber of Deputies, de facto liquidates the package of saving measures, imposed in the autumn by the Fischer government to curb public indebtedness.
Klaus can but does not have to sign the law on the state budget; today he declared during a breakfast with businessmen that politicians had long neglected "the serious problem", that is, "the unsustainable deficit" of public finances.
According to him, they no longer have a good solution.
Only a strong government, which can be supported by a broader consensus among political parties, could improve this situation, the president believes.
SDG leader Mirek Topolánek mentioned that the budget is appalling and that the government should think about its future existence.
ODS Vice President Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as told <0xC4><0x8C>TK that the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, ODS and the Greens evidently no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer reacted and called similar words “strong sentences.”
The head of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Paroubek, reacted to Topolánek by saying that the budget deficit is appalling, prepared for this year by the former Topolánek government. It will exceed 200 billion kroner.
On Wednesday <0xC4><0x8C>SSD said that the approval of the state budget for next year was successful.
The people were also happy.
Mandela in the new Clint Eastwood film, played by Morgan Freeman
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film, Invictus: Invincible, tells a lot about the country, its struggle and its victories, although some critics say that the leading roles are played by American actors.
The story is about sports, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is portrayed in his biography by Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said the 91-year-old Mandela asked him to play him in the Eastwood film.
Another important role is played by Matt Damon.
I said, "When I interpret you, I'll have to have access to you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who received the award for his role in Eastwood’s drama about the boxing world Million Dollar Baby, played the role of the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, who ended up being a slave, of the fictional president of the USA, and even of God in Evan Almighty.
The former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for his activities to end apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and for four years became president of the country.
In 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus - Invincible is a Latin word and the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film is a true story about Nelson Mandela, who joined forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to help unite the country. Mandela, the new president, knows that after apartheid his nation remains racially and economically divided.
He believes that he is able to unite his people through sport, and that is why he decides to unite rugby players, who belong to the outsiders on a global scale.
The South African team reached the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to bring Mandela’s story to cinemas.
He had no other goal than to play this role in such a way that it was as close as possible to reality, Freeman said.
Naturally, the biggest challenge was to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were from the same area, he would have tried to meet with Mandela, have dinner with him, be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing was that he wanted to shake Mandela’s hand.
I found that when I squeezed his hand, I received his energy, it was transmitted and I had the feeling of knowing how you feel, he said.
For me it is important to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon plays the role of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team, in which white players predominated.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the tough world of rugby.
A big surprise for him was, when he finally met Pienaar for the first time at his home.
I remember knocking on the door, he opened it and the first thing I said to Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Pienaar in my life was, “In the movie I look a lot taller.”
Despite the obvious differences between the actors' characters and their actual models, and under the management of director Eastwood, Invictus: Invincible received positive reviews and there is also talk of ambitions for the Oscar.
Daily Variety magazine film critic Todd McCarthy summed up his assessment in these words: "It was a very good story, a very well-made film."
In movie reviews on the website rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive reviews.
The secret of the splendor over Norway solved: the Russians made tests of a missile
A special light effect of unknown origin was observed over Norway.
The Russian Defense Ministry acknowledged yesterday that near the border with Norway it tested an intercontinental ballistic missile.
The "Bulava" type missile, previously intended to be the pride of the Russian army, is becoming the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Even their repeated presence in the missile tests has not had the desired effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava, in most cases, did not fly or there was a failure in the air.
In Russian newspapers they write about "Bulava" as "a missile that does not fly".
A missile that does not fly, but shines.
During this, the 13th test, there was no problem at first.
At the end of the flight there were again technical problems in the aircraft.
The engine probably exploded in the third stage of the missile.
This time "Bulava" was launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskoy, which was floating submerged in the White Sea.
This type of missile makes it possible to launch from a vessel that is moving and submerged at the same time.
That’s why it’s likely that the mysterious light over Norway, caused by an unidentified flying object, was actually the failed “Bulava.”
The Norwegians did not hesitate that it was a Russian missile.
The generals this time defend themselves by asserting that one cannot simply speak of a failure.
The first two stages of the missile held and the failure occurred in the third.
In the previous cases the engines broke down immediately in the first stage.
Although none of the launches went completely without errors, according to the management of the Ministry of Defense only six of the thirteen were unsuccessful.
The success of almost fifty percent full of optimism to the generals and that is why they continue to affirm that "Bulava" one day will fly without problems and that it will even manage to carry up to ten nuclear hypersonic blocks, whose maximum total weight is 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
Legendary defender Viacheslav Fetisov will return at the age of 51 to a professional hockey match.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup winner will help his CSKA Moscow team and possibly play on Friday in the KHL duel against St. Petersburg.
Fetisov finished his professional career at the age of forty in 1998 and currently presides over CSKA.
After Denis Kulyash was injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov practices constantly and is committed to helping the team.
We just need to sort out some formal issues, the AP quoted Sergei Nemchinov, the Moscow club’s coach, as saying.
It is not yet clear whether the return of the famous player will refer to a single match.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can lift the spirits of the other players, Nemchinov said.
If Fetisov returns to the ice rink, he will become the longest-serving professional player in Russian hockey.
Legendary forward Gordie Howe played in the NHL for Hartford at the age of fifty-one for the entire season, scoring 15 goals and 26 assists.
The biggest of the group of five famous players Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
Playing for the Soviet Union he won two Olympic golds, seven world championships, triumphed in the Canada Cup and in the junior world championships.
In the second part of his career he also had success in the NHL: playing with Detroit he won the Stanley Cup twice.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame.
Hyundai fulfilled the requirements of the unions. It will cancel all supplementary work
The management of the car factory in No<0xC5><0xA1>ovice agreed with the unions to cancel all supplementary work.
Precisely because of the frequent supplementary work, the unions declared the emergency by strike on Monday.
The information was confirmed by Petr Van<0xC4><0x9B>k, the spokesman for the Hyundai car factory.
The management, however, wants to agree this year with the unions one more Saturday shift.
We cannot resign to our manufacturing plan, as it is essential, which is why we proposed voluntary supplementary work for Saturday, December 19, that is, work will be done in two shifts, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k said.
According to the server Sedmi<0xC4><0x8D>ka.cz, the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to employees working the Saturday shift.
The bonus will also be paid for last Saturday, November 28th.
According to Va<0xC5><0x88>ka, the company decided to change the way of motivating its employees with the additional work offered.
Employees can collect the bonus for overtime or they can take a day off on December 28, that is, extend the Christmas holidays by one day, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k said.
In addition, all Saturday shift employees will receive money for travel and food.
Because the supplementary work was the most urgent and problematic point of the comments and complaints of the trade unionists and strikers, who stopped manufacturing last week, the management yesterday afternoon immediately decided to cancel all the supplementary work for the month of December, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k mentioned.
The employees of the car factory were forced to work two more hours in addition to eight-hour shifts and this situation lasted practically every day until last week.
After signing the agreement, the unions will cancel the strike emergency.
Another negotiation between the factory management and the trade unionists is due to take place on Monday morning.
Trade union leader Petr Kucha<0xC5><0x99> said on Wednesday that if they committed to meet the requirements and the document was signed, they are willing to cancel the emergency by strike.
The situation at the car factory worsened last week when about 400 employees spontaneously went on strike for frequent overtime work.
They also protested against poor payment conditions and alleged harassment.
Management felt that employees had to work overtime to meet requirements and be able to supply the cars.
The unionists in their declaration of the emergency by strike on Monday, also demanded that none of the employees, who last Wednesday stopped manufacturing, be penalized in any way.
As far as supplementary work is concerned, the trade unions demand that the company reduce it to a minimum.
In addition, this year they require a salary of 5,000 kroner for this work.
The car factory in No<0xC5><0xA1>ovice Hyundai currently has 2,000 employees.
Mass production began last November.
Until last September it manufactured approximately 80,000 cars; its current production potential is 200,000 cars per year.
A Czech discovery: an effective substance even in 'stranded' HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists tests new compounds capable of moderating the spread of HIV in the body
The main advantage of this improved substance is the fact that it is also effective against drug-resistant viruses.
In some cases this is more important than the fact that the compound is not as effective in a common variant of the virus, as some drugs already available.
The AIDS disease cannot be cured until now.
However, the life of patients can be significantly prolonged thanks to a mixture of drugs that prevent the replication of the HIV virus in the body.
However, its use has many side effects.
If the replication of the virus is not completely suppressed, so-called resistant viruses will be created; against them, drugs no longer work.
The work of experts from three Institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, V<0xC5><0xA0>CHT Prague and the University of Heidelberg demonstrates the possibility of mastering the resistance of the virus.
They showed that substances called metallocarborans have an effect on albumin, which is responsible for the spread of the HIV virus.
Metallocarborans are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus in a different way than all the drugs used today, and that is why they can solve the problem of resistance.
In their work, the scientists find new, ‘improved’ compounds, prepared by knowing the molecular mechanism of their binding to the virus’s albumin.
Metallocarborans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two polyhedral cages composed of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms are joined by the metal atom, in this case by cobalt.
A Traitorous and Resilient Virus
HIV protease is an albumin of the HIV virus, and is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease, HIV virus fractionation would not occur and mature, infectious corpuscles of the virus would not be created.
If we stop HIV protease, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient’s body, the scientists explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In a paper published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry scientists describe a series of compounds, in which two pairs of cages (see table) are joined by a short organic series, which continues to be systematically modified.
Slightly weaker, but more effective
The test of the effect of this series of substances against HIV protease was carried out in a test tube, and also against its resistant variants, obtained from HIV patients.
The effect of metallocarborans on the common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as in clinically used drugs, however they do not lose their effect on resistant variants, in which drugs often do not work.
The mechanism of the unique effect, its other qualities such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications makes metallocarborans interesting compounds for research with the aim of proposing effective drugs against HIV, says Pavl<0xC3><0xAD>na <0xC5><0x98>ezá<0xC4><0x8D>ová, the head of the Laboratory of Structural Biology at the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics.
Fight for the budget. ODS attacked Fischer, he defends himself
ODS chief Mirek Topolánek said the budget approved for next year is “terrible” and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should, according to him, think about its future existence.
The ODS statements were singled out by the prime minister as strong sentences.
They say it leaves time for analysis.
ODS Vice President Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as said that the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, ODS and the Green Party evidently no longer works.
According to Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as, the prime minister has to decide whether in the Chamber of Deputies he wants to rely on the minority, which is trying to fight the growing deficit, or whether he wants to stay in his post with the help of the parliamentary left.
The attitude of SDGs and social democracy towards the problem of the public deficit is completely different, Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as warned.
The Chamber of Deputies yesterday approved the budget for 2010, however with the amending proposals by the left, for more than 12 billion crowns.
The Chamber of Deputies increased the money for salaries of state officials, for social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government criticized the SDG proposals, as they covertly increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should govern with a deficit of 163 billion kroner.
ODS before the vote left the room and thus fulfilled the desire of the government, that the modified budget is better than a provisional budget.
Disappointment and Uselessness
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and sense of futility; Prime Minister Jan Fischer mentioned that the government will reassess the current situation.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as is convinced that if Janota would seriously threaten to resign if the amending proposals were approved, the situation could have been different.
According to <0xC4><0x8C>eská TV Janota asked for a meeting with the prime minister.
He said he’s thinking about staying in the role.
The reason is his disappointment with the budget negotiations.
If Fischer agrees to another fight against the budget deficit, according to Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as in the government have nothing to do the nominees for the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, which imposed the changes in the budget.
The prime minister should also say clearly, if he will resign, whether the chamber will pass other laws that increase the deficit, for example those that refer to sickness grants, rents, or the amendment of the service law.
Topolánek: The ministers nominated by the SDGs are not to blame
It is the business of Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The ministers nominated by the SDGs have done nothing wrong, Topolánek stressed in the US text news.
He recalled that in several ministries in the posts of lieutenants there are people who belong to the TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as stressed, that if Fischer decides to resign the principle of the struggle with the height of the deficit of the public treasury, "it is absolutely logical and correct, that it rests on the leftist majority, which is currently in the Chamber of Deputies".
However, it will not be able to count on the support and tolerance of the members of ODS.
I have not thought about it, when the time comes, I will take care of it, said Defense Minister Martin Bartak, who was appointed to the government precisely by the members of ODS.
Prime Minister Fischer in the afternoon went to a meeting of the European Council in Brussels.
ODS relented at Prime Minister's request
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as stressed, that the SDGs in the Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday would probably vote against the amended budget, if the Prime Minister does not explicitly ask the SDG deputies to allow the acceptance of the budget.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not small children, he reacted to the question, if ODS does not worry about the absence of the party leader in parliament and in the Czech Republic, during the negotiations on the budget.
I didn't realize my vote was missing.
When he resigned, he knew that in the following months it was mainly a question of Bolshevization of the Chamber of Deputies and the destruction of everything positive, Topolánek himself reacted.
According to the new train schedule of <0xC4><0x8C>D there will be fewer trains for almost the same rates
<0xC4><0x8C>eské dráhy (Czech Railways) from 13 December will cancel or restrict some less used fast and local trains and, on the contrary, will reinforce some links.
The total extension of traffic will be reduced by two percent compared to today, after the new train schedule goes into effect.
Most rates including the basic and customer price will not change.
More possibilities of links to the capital will win for example the inhabitants of the region of Ostravsko, drahy for this line will add a pendulum road.
The direct train, on the contrary, will no longer run to Bratislava.
On the route Prague - P<0xC3><0xAD>sek - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice there will be less rapid trains, direct connections Prague - Letohrad will be restricted.
In the regions, the largest planned reduction in transport by drahy is in the Hradec Králové region, eight percent in total, while transport will increase in Prague and the surrounding area.
Two night trains on the route Prague - Tábor - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice will also be cancelled and some fast trains on the line Prague - P<0xC3><0xAD>sek - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice will be reduced to only a few weekdays.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, the inhabitants of Milovice have to change in Lysá nad Labem.
This is the 15th line of the Esko system, in the vicinity of the cities, its opening is possible thanks to the electrification of the line from Lysá nad Labem to Milovice.
Long-distance connections to the capital will end at Prague Hlavn<0xC3><0xAD> nádra<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD> station.
<0xC4><0x8C>D will introduce more SC Pendolino links between Prague and Ostrava and trains to <0xC5><0xA0>umperk/Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k will run every two hours.
From December 13th, travelers will not travel to Bratislava again in Pendolino.
The count by regional railways this year: 200 million more than before
The fast trains are commissioned and paid for by the Ministry of Transport, to cover the so-called demonstrable losses Drahy will receive next year four billion crowns in total, as this year. The local trains are commissioned by the regions, next year they will pay eight billion crowns in total, and the State will help them almost three billion.
This year regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
For fast and local drahy trains have a new ten-year contract, so far the contract was always one year.
Drahy are happy with the system, and perhaps that is why they did not raise the prices of a large majority of the tickets.
The changes will only occur on the day tickets - <0xC4><0x8C>D Net and on the cheap eLi<0xC5><0xA1>ka internet tickets.
For travellers without a customer card, the <0xC4><0x8C>D Net price will increase from 450 kroner to 600 kroner.
The price of eLi<0xC5><0xA1>ka will depend on the distance, until now there was the one-off price of 160 kroner for travel between any two regional cities.
Armed Filipinos continue to detain more than 50 people, children released
The armed forces have kidnapped 75 people in the southern Philippines today, including several elementary school students and their teachers.
This was confirmed by the AFP agency, which previously reported only 65 kidnapped.
All 17 children arrested and a teacher were released after eight hours.
The kidnapping took place in Agusan del Sur province.
They say that approximately 19 armed uses the hostages as a living shield in the escape before the police.
Local negotiators are trying to agree on the surrender of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the armed men belong to the New People’s Army (NPA), an armed faction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP agency, the police previously pursued the kidnappers due to the violence, whose cause was the adjustment of the accounts between two clans of local families.
In the southern Philippines in Maguindanao province it was because of the recent massacre, in which 57 people died, imposed martial law.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre, related to the governor’s elections, were 30 journalists.
Suspicion of involvement in the massacre led to the arrest of the governor of this province in the southern Philippines and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of an influential Ampatuan dynasty.
Muslim separatists also operate on Mindanao Island.
But on Tuesday they renewed peace talks with the Philippine government.
RSA's story concerns everyone, says Morgan Freeman aka Mandela
In the coming days, a new Hollywood film by Clint Eastwood Invictus (its official title in Czech is Invictus: Nepora<0xC5><0xBE>en<0xC3><0xBD>) will be released in US cinemas, capturing a part of the biography of former President of the South African Republic Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous anti-apartheid fighter is played by Morgan Freeman, whom Mandela himself chose for the starring role years ago.
The second role, that of legendary rugby champion Francoise Pienaar, was played by Matt Damon.
With the premiere are born the reactions of critics and the public
Nelson Mandela
His full name is Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela. He was born on July 18, 1918 in Mvezo, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, in 1993 he received, together with de Klerk, the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was President of the Republic of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
There is great hope, as it comes to the public at the time, when in the Republic of South Africa preparations for the world championship in football culminate. At the same time the media are shaken by alarming news about the growing racial hatred and discrimination of the inhabitants by the dominant black majority.
According to the AP news agency, reactions to this new film on RSA have been positive, despite numerous reservations against the distribution of lead roles by the "uninteresting" Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman, however, says he is proud of the new film.
For many years I dreamed of the role and prepared myself well to play it.
Many times I met in person with Nelson Mandela, to - as they say - charge his energy, he mentioned in an interview after the festive premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it’s good, if through the film we can remember Mandela’s character and message.
It is a history of the Republic of South Africa, but it refers to the whole world, he added.
In the national rugby team suit
The film is based on the book by the British writer John Carlin with the title freely translated In the Role of the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game. Thanks to this game the nation was born. It portrays the South African lawyer of human rights during his first electoral presidential period.
Morgan Freeman in the film is trying to unite two groups of inhabitants, racially and for long years apart. Like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he as protagonist also puts on the suit of the South African national rugby team and enters the playing field. RSA won at that time the world cup.
For entering the limelight in the costume, which in RSA is considered something almost sacred, Mandela fourteen years ago won great ovations, especially from the white public and the recognition of the white inhabitants.
The football championship may be able to help people unite and form a nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, the only "black" on the national team in 1995.
It will still be seen, if the tense situation in the RSA improves.
White South Africans however are skeptical, as said for example in a recent interview for LN a rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled his country to Brittany.
The championship begins on June 11, 2010.
In Lounsko burns a transformer with a value of tens of millions of crowns
The fire has gripped in the morning a transformer of the company <0xC4><0x8C>eps in a switch box near the village V<0xC3><0xBD><0xC5><0xA1>kov in Lounsko.
According to Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Marvan, the spokesman for firefighters in the <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> region, the fire is extinguished by six groups.
Previously firefighters wanted to let the transformer be destroyed by fire, however later they changed their minds and the fire is extinguishing it with a mixture of water, foam and a special extinguishing matter.
The fire was caused by a technical defect, the short circuit of the transformer.
There were no injuries, according to Pavla Mandátová, the company’s spokeswoman, the breakdown does not jeopardize the safe operation of the distribution system.
The estimated damage is several million crowns, enumerating it exactly will not be possible before the fire is put out.
According to Mandátová, it will be necessary to replace the destroyed transformer with a new one.
During the ten years of <0xC4><0x8C>eps' activity nothing similar happened, the breakdowns of this type are sporadic, he added.
According to Sona Holingerová Hendrychová, the spokeswoman for the <0xC4><0x8C>EZ society for northern Czechia, electricity supplies were not cut off, and the fire at the power substation did not affect the operation of homes, offices or businesses.
A.s. <0xC4><0x8C>eps p<0xC5><0xAF>sob<0xC3><0xAD> in the territory of the Czech Republic as exclusive maintainer of the distribution system, of the electrical conduction of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It preserves in good condition, renews and develops 39 switch boxes with 67 transformers, which carry the electrical energy from the transmission system to the distributor system, in addition to maintaining the 4339 kilometers long electrical conduction.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura to file libel complaint to three <0xC4><0x8C>SSD hetmans
Student Agency owner Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura will today file a libel complaint against three social democratic Hetmans.
These are Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek from the Jihomoravsk<0xC3><0xBD> kraj region, Radko Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nek from Pardubick<0xC3><0xBD> kraj and the hetman from Olomouck<0xC3><0xBD> kraj Martin Tesa<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura mentioned it in Twenty Minutes on Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urnál.
The demand has to do with the company’s effort to maintain regional rail transport in some regions.
All regions, however, ended up signing long-term contracts with <0xC4><0x8C>eské dráhy.
All three Hetmans are attacking us and talking about the fact that we are "taking the raisins from the cake", however we brought only the offer for what they themselves wanted.
They claim, that we are more expensive than <0xC4><0x8C>eské dráhy, which is not true. We know the prices of <0xC4><0x8C>eské dráhy, which were set last week.
So we have nothing left but to defend ourselves.
It is for slandering the Student Agency society, Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura told Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urnal.
He mentioned at the same time having the evidence of all the regions. According to him they have not taken necessary measures in harmony with European law.
That is why it is preparing an incentive for the European Commission.
Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek considers this denunciation by the continuation of Mr. Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura’s media show, which serves as free advertising for his company and for himself.
Naturally I am prepared to defend my good reputation and that of my region and I appeal to the other Hetmans to do so as well.
I suppose it will also be clearly demonstrated on this occasion that Mr Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura manipulates the public on the issue of regional rail transport, and uses false and misleading arguments, Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek said.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura announced last week that it would invest several million kroner in advertising, the aim of which would be to warn of these measures from the regions.
He told Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urnál that he would stop the campaign after Christmas and wants to continue it after the New Year.
He said that the campaign will be carried out against corruption as such.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura started the campaign after the regions agreed with <0xC4><0x8C>eské dráhy on maintaining regional rail links and for the order of approximately 150 billion kroner they did not call a tender.
According to Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura similar steps are at odds with the law and with the opinion of the European Court.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura claims to have been threatened by a <0xC4><0x8C>SSD deputy, due to his criticism of rail transport in the regions.
The only threat was, if we don't stop, we could lose the bus licenses.
He introduced himself as a deputy of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, I know, which gentleman it is, I will not say his name, Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura said today for Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urnál.
The pneumococcal vaccine will be free and voluntary
The pneumococcal vaccine from January will put an end to the usual customs.
As a first vaccine it must be free for families and at the same time voluntary.
However, there are already opinions that the mandatory vaccine would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of the free pneumococcal vaccine are coming to a close.
The Institute of Medicine is already setting maximum prices for vaccines, which will be covered by insurance companies.
The experts are also clear in the vaccination procedure.
The new vaccine
Free vaccines for children born in August
From January, children born on or after August 2 of last year will be able to receive the pneumococcal vaccine free of charge.
The condition is that you have not received a single dose of the vaccine before.
Those who started the vaccine last year or earlier have to cover other doses of the vaccine as well.
The first dose of the vaccine must be received between the third and fifth month of child's age.
Last year, a quarter of families voluntarily allowed their children to be vaccinated against pneumococcus.
The parents, however, paid for a dose of 1600 crowns and more.
Four doses are needed to vaccinate younger children.
Experts generally estimate that insurance companies will spend 300-450,000 kroner annually on vaccines.
However, they will save on treatment, which is needed for unvaccinated children.
So far the state has spent on all vaccinations of children approximately 500,000 annually.
The covered vaccination was initiated by the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcus is the cause of otitis media, but also of serious infections including meningitis and sepsis.
Of the pneumococcal infections in our country every year die according to research in hospitals 28 children not older than 10 years of age.
In addition to the Czech Republic pneumococcal vaccine cover in children was introduced in about 40 countries.
Will the vaccine be mandatory?
However, at the same time there are opinions that this vaccine could be mandatory in the future.
From January it must be covered by insurance companies and voluntary.
The mandatory vaccination would be better, said Rudolf Kalovsk<0xC3><0xBD>, the head of the Nahlas civic association, for example.
Their association has been spreading pneumococcal vaccines for a long time.
Experts at an international conference, in which our association participated, were not completely satisfied with the fact that we have the voluntary vaccine.
It's not completely ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy to achieve at least this.
I think this is the path we now have to take, Kalovsk<0xC3><0xBD> said.
The Ministry of Health however does not want to change the pneumococcal vaccination procedure.
At the moment we do not think about it at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88>.
Voluntary vaccination has its downsides, doctors say
The president of the society of pediatricians Odborná spole<0xC4><0x8D>nost praktick<0xC3><0xBD>ch d<0xC4><0x9B>tsk<0xC3><0xBD>ch léka<0xC5><0x99><0xC5><0xAF> Hana Cabrnochová acknowledges that voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
"In the situation, when the vaccine costs such a high amount, we relatively understand the political decision to have started vaccination as a volunteer," says Cabrnochová.
Experts expect that as of next year more than 80 percent of young parents will vaccinate their babies against pneumococci.
The pneumococcal vaccine is a big change also because as the first vaccination in children it is covered by health companies, not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend more money on prophylaxis, to then save on treatment, Cabrnochová explains.
Doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves.
However, pediatricians are concerned about the purchase of vaccines.
Previously, vaccines had to be purchased by insurance companies and distributed to doctors, just as when the state gives them other vaccines.
Some MPs, however, were afraid that the insurance companies might "take the money out of health insurance".
The doctors will have to buy the vaccines and wait until they are paid by the insurance companies.
It is estimated that pediatricians will invest 40 thousand per month in vaccines, which is a remarkable sum.
It won’t be easy, Cabrnochová says.
The son of an American artist involved "in the theft of a museum"
The son of renowned American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta has been accused of trying to steal $20 million worth of paintings from his father’s museum.
Pennsylvania police say Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught carrying 90 frames in his vehicle and trailer.
They claim that Frazetta and another man used a bulldozer to break into the museum, in the Pocono Mountains region.
Frazetta Sr., 81, is famous for his portrayal of characters such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
The Associated Press reported that the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
An unidentified police official said a family dispute may have motivated the young Frazetta.
The agency reported that Frazatta, 52, told police that his father had ordered him “to enter the museum by any means to move all the paintings to a depot.”
The agency said Father Frazetta denied having granted such permission.
Labour Party Defends Tax Increases in Budget
Ministers have defended tax increases and spending cuts in the pre-budget report, in the face of criticism from the opposition, businesses and unions.
The Conservatives said Alistair Darling "wasted" an opportunity to show his seriousness about cutting the deficit, delaying decisions until after the election.
The Finance Minister also received harsh criticism for hurting low- and middle-income workers.
Among its main proposals are a 0.5% increase in Social Security spending and a 1% cap on public sector wage agreements as of 2011.
Anger over Social Security
Unions have lamented that low-wage workers are being punished by a recession spawned by others, and warned of future “problems.”
Rising Social Security spending, which will grow by around <0xC2><0xA3>3bn a year, has infuriated the business community, which says this is a tax on jobs, when the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, limited to those earning more than <0xC2><0xA3>20,000 a year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
KEY POINTS OF THE PRE-BUDGE REPORT
Social Security with an additional 0.5% increase, as of April 2011
The economy will contract more than expected 4.75% this year
New 50% Tax on Bankers' Bonds
The increase of 1 point of the corporate tax for small firms was ruled out
Tax relief for electric cars and wind turbines
The state pension would increase by 2.5%
According to estimates by the Ministry of Finance, a person who earns <0xC2><0xA3>30,000 will lose <0xC2><0xA3>90 a year and a person who earns <0xC2><0xA3>40,000 will lose <0xC2><0xA3>190, while a person who earns <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 a year will earn <0xC2><0xA3>110.
The ministers said their goal of halving the deficit by 2013 involved "hard decisions", but insisted that 60 percent of the additional tax burden would fall on the top 5 percent of wages.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms denied that the tax hikes and spending cuts outlined were a “grain of sand in the desert” compared to what was needed.
"These are big figures, it will allow us to cut the deficit in half, which is absolutely essential for the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident the economy would grow again by the end of the year.
However, Labour's forecasts for future economic growth, which will influence the amount to be borrowed and the speed with which the deficit is reduced, have been called into question after the Finance Minister was forced to modify the first figures.
In his statement, he said the economy would likely contract by 4.75% this year, far worse than the 3.5% decline forecast in April, while borrowing would be <0xC2><0xA3>3bn higher than previously estimated.
"Opportunity wasted"
The Conservatives, who will launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday, warning of the Labour party’s “debt crisis”, said the <0xC2><0xA3>789bn loan application projection for the next six years was unsustainable.
Ministers had failed to come up with a credible plan on how they would repay the money, they added, “cynically” dodging difficult options until after the June 2010 elections.
"They haven't included anything significant about what they're going to do," said shadow Finance Minister Philip Hammond. "They had a chance to do it and they've wasted it."
"All important announcements will be made after the election, whoever wins wins."
by Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The Labour Party insists that schools, hospitals and the police will be protected from future cuts, unlike the Conservative proposals, which would seek further deficit reduction in the shorter term.
But liberal Democrats claimed that the money raised by the tax increases and spending cuts would be used to sustain next year’s spending, not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the projects were like “sandcastles.”
BBC political editor Nick Robinson said the timing of the announcements, such as the above-mentioned rise in inflation of some disability subsidies next April, would leave the finance minister exposed to allegations of electioneering, as the money could simply be recovered the following year.
However, the Labour Party insists that it is providing people with the most they need and will review the situation in September 2010.
"False Budget"
Although ministers did not release post-2011 spending data, economists said it was clear that the adjustment in public spending would only be felt in the medium term.
The respected Institute for Fiscal Studies said the Finance Minister’s figures implied substantial cuts in many areas, potentially including transportation, higher education, science and defense in the future.
“This is really postponing the pain for later,” said director Robert Chote.
"All the important announcements will come after the election, whoever wins," added Roger Bootle, economic consultant to Deloitte's accountants.
"This has been the false report before the budget. The markets realize this."
FBI Investigates ‘Detentions of Americans in Pakistan’
The FBI is investigating the arrest in Pakistan of five American men suspected of extremist connections.
The U.S. Embassy in Pakistan told the BBC that the men were arrested in a raid on a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern province of Punjab.
The FBI has said it is investigating whether they are the same men who disappeared from their homes in Virginia last month.
The U.S. foreign ministry said it was also looking for information about the men.
Three of them are reported to be of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
“If they’re U.S. citizens, of course we’re going to be very interested in the charges they’ve been detained on and what kind of circumstances they’re being held in,” Kelly said.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identities and the nature of their business there, if indeed these are the students who were missing," the spokeswoman said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men were detained in a house belonging to one of their uncles.
He said the house was already in the sights of local police and no charges had yet been filed against the detainees.
Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrests, Reuters reported, but said the U.S. had to “work more closely with both Afghanistan and Pakistan, to try to eradicate the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people.”
The families of the five students reported their disappearance in Northern Virginia in late November.
Amnesty International condemns Iranian ‘abuses’
Human rights in Iran over the past 20 years have always been equally deficient, according to a report by the campaign group Amnesty International.
The report details “models of abuse” of the regime, both before and after presidential elections held in June.
One man cited in the report said he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes, while another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has rejected previous criticism of its human rights record.
Officials have said such criticism has a political basis.
Thousands of people arrested and dozens killed in Iran after the election held by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad sparked the largest street protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens of people have been convicted, and prosecutors say at least five people have been sentenced to death.
BBC Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne, who is now in London, says that during the protests, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei acknowledged some allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, the authorities have shown very little tolerance for criticism, according to our correspondent.
"False Confession"
Amnesty International cited the account of Ebrahim Mehtari, a 26-year-old computer science student, who claimed he was accused of “working with Facebook networks” and protesting against the election result.
“They often hit me in the face,” he said.
“They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... They threatened to execute me and humiliated me.”
Amnesty said that after five days he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still bleeding and semi-conscious.
In August, defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said some protesters detained after the election had been tortured to death in prison, and others had been raped.
Iranian officials denied the rape allegations, but admitted that there had been abuses.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee, who said he was held in a container along with 75 others for more than eight weeks at a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and judiciary had set up committees to investigate the post-selection malaise and the government’s response, but said the mandate and powers of the bodies were unclear and the parliamentary committee’s inquiries had not been made public.
The group said at least 90 people had been detained in the past three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski slope was made in the city park
More than 100 tonnes of artificial snow were used to turn a Bristol site of interest into a racetrack.
The Track at the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who competed for cash prizes.
At the top of the slope in Brandon Hill Park was a short jumping ramp, facing a 100-meter-long track.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the track, but it was pretty scary.
It looks down under a beautiful view of the twinkling city lights.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the county, true talent,” he added.
The awards were given to the best tricks or maneuvers performed on the track.
After the Thursday afternoon event, the snow will be allowed to melt.
Still they and we
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters have called for a ban on the construction of minarets and when there is widespread warning about the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a detailed and studied report on the possible integration of Muslims (who are actually integrating) into one of the most openly secular societies on the continent.
Some readers will come to this new book as admirers of the author's latest work "Why the French Don't Like Headcarves" (2006), an elegant and detailed study of a problem that divided and worried the country for a decade and a half, and whose effects are still perceived today.
Mr. Bowen’s latest book has a broader and more ambitious perspective.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is really going on.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide France’s 5-6 million Muslims with what Mr. Bowen calls “Islamic spaces.”
He is a good listener who reproduces debates between teachers and students about the questions that interest them most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or in a town hall (or both)?
Should they teach young Muslims about evolution and gay rights?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it legitimate for a Muslim to use an interest-based banking system to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly mundane issues, he argues, things of daily life that preoccupy the media more than political dramas.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, professors and intellectuals, none of them of renown, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, a Swiss-born Arab Muslim scholar and scholar.
This new generation tries to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They do not succeed in spreading this argument completely.
Conservatives doubt only the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists Mr. Bowen interviews tend to disagree with his Salafi counterparts, supporters of the purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, who currently have a small but influential presence among Muslims in Europe.
Bowen thinks Muslim values and French secularism might be compatible.
But adaptation requires mutual concessions.
It questions the extent to which French political strategists (and the intellectual elite who so fiercely defend secularism) are truly committed to pluralism.
It suggests that Muslims are likely to be treated more unfairly than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who have also had to make their historic commitments to secular republicanism.
More than a growing pragmatism, it perceives "an adjustment of values".
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one tends to say "Yes, but not yet."
The most bleak panorama in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other habitat on the planet.
The ice that defines it is melting at an alarming rate, taking with it life that cannot survive anywhere else.
The interests of oil, gas, shipping and fishing have focused on recently opened waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors, as a consequence of this.
In "On Thin Ice" Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, paints a natural history of the northern icon, the polar bear.
A connoisseur of the complicated history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers, who proved their worth in the face of the white bear.
Admiral Nelson’s encounter as a valiant 14-year-old cadet, fighting only with the tip of his musket, is surely a myth, but others are true.
The pups, captured while swimming following the bodies of their newly exterminated mothers, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
A circus performance in the early 20th century, it exhibited 75 polar bears at the same time.
Even today, zoo enclosures are still generally one-millionth the area of a wild adult's range. The climate is almost never adequate: a polar bear resident in Singapore turned green by algae growing within the hairless areas of its fur.

Ellis draws on accounts from other writers and historians, and often returns to the threat that hunters pose to the survival of species.
Although prohibited in Norway, the U.S. and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters on helicopters and Eskimo Indians on snowmobiles use high-powered assault rifles to shoot down their prey.
Ironically, it is in the waters to the north of those two hunting nations that the ice will last the longest.
In his new book, “After the Ice,” Alun Anderson, a former New Scientist editor, offers a chillingly clear account of Arctic science and a startling look at how the future of the Arctic can be transformed.
It’s not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of change.
It's not for lack of commitment.
The pioneering voyages of Fridtjof Nansen in the late 19th and early 20th centuries gave first hints about the displacement of ice masses.
Then the Cold War submarines drew a map of the shifting ice cords circulating beneath the ice masses.
Satellite scans and extensive series of iceberg-mounted probes are a useful supplement, but hardy individuals camped in the cold still perform many tasks.
Mr. Anderson looks into the extraordinary, tiny world of the tributary system within the Arctic ice, made up of trickles of saline water that compress as it freezes.
But from the bear on the surface to the microscopic wonders of the interior, they are all doomed once the summer ice retreats, which is thought to happen sometime between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months... these could be us
Marines among 6,000 who place crowns on Arlington graves
Pfc. De'Angello Robinson, 19, traveled seven hours by bus to place a single crown on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, N.C., to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate graves, it was a day to pay tribute to men and women who once stood in their boots.
In a few months, from where we are being shipped, this could be us, Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If it’s us, I’d want someone to do the same for me, so I’m just trying to show respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered Saturday morning to place wreaths on veterans’ graves at various sections of Arlington Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of the Worcester Crown Company in Harrington, Maine, kicked off the event when he and others decided to decorate several hundred graves in Arlington Cemetery.
In what is already an 18-year tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen make the trip each year by stopping in different cities along the way, to officiate events dedicated to military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which has extended the event to other states.
This year volunteers placed more than 16,000 wreaths in graves at Arlington Cemetery, areas at the Pentagon, graves at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, Battery Park in New York City, and at the memorial site for United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to purchase and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a career military dead.
As long as her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said this was his way of giving retribution to those who made sacrifices.
This is a modest way civilians can support our troops, he said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Wrapped in layers of warm clothing, volunteers walked through the cemetery’s wide meadows and hills.
Volunteers headed to older graves from World War I, World War II, and the Vietnam War because they don’t get as many visitors as new graves, organizers said.
The atmosphere was joyful as the children played and the couples held hands, while bringing the fresh pine to the tombstones.
Each circular crown was a deep green, with a small red bow tied at the top.
Nearby, Section 60, where most of the veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars are buried, was virtually silent.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 crowns to decorate the section, but the gloomy atmosphere of the current wars invaded the area.
People cried openly, others prayed, and families and friends leaned on each other in the glacial air.
Some read aloud names carved into the stones, while others bowed to see small black and white plates placed inside the wet mud, for those whose headstones have not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who wiped tears from her eyes in front of her son’s grave.
He drove eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the grave of Marine gunner Sgt. David Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free. . . my son paid for it, he said.
"Long after my death I want someone to remember it."
Cuban Officials Arrest U.S. Government Contractor
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. government contractor who distributed mobile phones and laptops in the country, State Department officials said Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Bethesda-based Development Alternatives Inc.
The company works on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officers along with the U.S. Interests Section in Havana are seeking access to the detainee, who was arrested Dec. 5.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost anything considered “dangerous.”
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including mild protests and critical writings, carry the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a budding blogging community, led by popular commentator Yoani Sanchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sanchez has repeatedly applied for permission to leave the country to accept awards, but has been denied permission.
The arrest of a U.S. contractor may likely lead to tensions between the Castro brothers’ communist government in Cuba and the Obama administration, which has been seeking a “slow-paced” approach to improving relations with the island.
The New York Times was the first to report the arrest on Friday night.
The new U.S. policy emphasizes that if the Cuban government takes concrete steps, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for opposition, there will be reciprocity on the part of the United States.
Mobile phones and laptops are legal in Cuba, even if they are new and coveted products in a country where the average salary of a government worker is $15 a month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones only this year; they are mostly used for texting, as a 15-minute phone conversation would cost the daily wage.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and for foreign visitors to the hotel, and in some government establishments, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often have to give their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The arrest of an American in Cuba is unusual.
Gloria Berbena, a press officer at the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, said most of the handful of U.S. citizens in jail in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking.
Berbena said he could not provide more information about the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly misguided.
An activity that in any other open society would be legal, such as handing out free mobile phones, in Cuba is a crime, said José Miguel Vivanco, director of the Americas program at Human Rights Watch, which recently published a tough report on freedoms in Cuba, called "Nuevo Castro, same Cuba," a reference to Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Castro's placement as leader of the country, to replace his ailing older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said defendants are often arrested, prosecuted and jailed within a day.
He said that any solution would probably be political, and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just as the two countries begin to have more dialogue.
Pakistani officials plot to send men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities on Saturday neutralized the suspected mastermind of a plot to send five men from Northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops, saying they hoped the case could help unravel an extensive network of terrorist recruiters, who scour the Internet for radicalized youth.
Investigators said they were pursuing a mysterious insurgent figure, known as Saifullah, who invited the men to Pakistan after discovering that one of them made comments approving terrorist attacks on the internet video site YouTube.
Saifullah led the men once they were in Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan’s tribal belt, which is a familiar place for al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who had been briefed on the case said on Saturday that Saifullah failed to convince al Qaeda commanders that the men were not part of a CIA plot to infiltrate the terror network.
Therefore, they were isolated for several days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the imposing mountains of the northwest, which have become a terrorist paradise.
They were considered part of a covert operation.
For this reason they were rejected, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the case.
The official said the men were unfazed and were even trying to get proper approval to access al Qaeda camps when they were arrested by Pakistani police authorities.
The case of the five men, who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI, underscores the critical role recruiters play in identifying potential terrorists and, perhaps most importantly, determining who they can trust.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, U.S. intelligence has made it a top priority to try to infiltrate people inside al Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as guards, not letting through those who do not demonstrate a serious commitment to the holy war, and those who could be spies.
Analysts said al Qaeda is paying special attention to aspiring American recruits.
But for the organization they represent a huge draw, because of their potential to gain access to American targets and because of their propaganda value.
But Evan Kohlmann, a senior analyst for the U.S.-based NEFA Foundation, said terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years about who they admit to, because U.S. intelligence agencies have become adept at their recruitment methods.
“If you’re trying to infiltrate someone into these groups, what better way than to follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed,” Kohlmann said.
It has become a much more web-based model.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen, demanding climate 'action'
On Saturday, tens of thousands of protesters marched through the streets demanding bolder climate action from negotiators working at the city’s Bella Center Convention Center.
Protesters said 100,000 people participated in the event, but police estimated the number was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists placed small explosives near a cluster of government buildings in the city center.
On a day in which little happened in the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists walked through the city holding banners in English that read “There is no Planet B” and one in Spanish that declared, “The Earth says “enough is enough.”
Several celebrities joined the protest, including Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that traveling to Peru, her mother’s native country, made me aware of the distressing issues the country must deal with due to the impacts of climate change that are already happening.”
This is part of the reason why I have decided to join the great demonstration, to spread the word and appeal to the leaders of the world, to present a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, he said.
This is not an easy task, but it has to be done, there is no way around it any longer.
Police prevented protesters from getting too close to the Bella Center, saying they had arrested 19 people, mostly for wearing masks or carrying pocket knives.
Under Danish law, such activities are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to a witness, who asked not to be identified because he was involved in the climate talks, activists in sports masks and black outfits planted several explosives near Copenhagen’s main canal, which is close to several ministries.
They were around the buildings, he said, adding that they started as flares but were followed by "a couple of big explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered around the television screens to watch the march throughout the afternoon.
But the protest did not seem to penetrate the consciousness of key officials like Su Wei, China’s chief climate negotiator.
Asked if he thought the demonstration was having a constructive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, “I really wasn’t aware of the situation.”
Then he went on to say in Mandarin, "As the meeting place is large, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He noted that it was up to the perspective of each to define whether the march was being detrimental or beneficial.
He said this shows the attention of the general public and different sectors to the issue of climate change.
On the other hand, "it can also be said that they affect negotiations, or the freedom of other people.
Test data reveals persistent racial differences
Last week’s federal report card on math achievement was very good news for the Capital District’s public schools.
Although the District is still far from the best-performing systems in the country, the report showed that fourth- and eighth-graders have stepped up at a faster pace over the past two years, relative to the cities of Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is recorded in the recent figures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress is the persistent performance difference between African-American students and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average scores of white fourth-graders in D.C. over the past two years rose from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but their African-American peers rose just three points, from 209 to 212.
The performance gap actually grew between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African-Americans in the eighth grade remained essentially fixed, dropping a statistically insignificant point from 245 to 244.
The average scores of the whites were not included in the test results, because the sample size was not large enough.
Over a six-year stretch, the picture is no more encouraging.
The difference between white and black fourth graders in 2003, when the first ENPE was unveiled in the District, was 60 points on the scale (262 to 202).
Although the scores achieved by children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference has barely narrowed to 58.
Some education lawyers in the District expressed concern last week, as the advances celebrated by Rector Michelle A. El Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat), were largely driven by white students, who are already very good students.
This would suggest that we have improved the whole by catering to those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and conflicting, said Jeff Smith, executive director of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit that advocates for educational equity in the District.
“I’m not jumping for joy by a difference of two or three points,” said D.C. Council member Kwame R. Brown (D-Ed.), who has a daughter in the fourth grade of Eaton Elementary.
Brown, a frequent critic of Rhee’s management style, said the message of the test scores is that the city’s high schools are in desperate need of attention.
Clearly you always want to see the positive signs, and I respect that.
But what worries us is that we are not devoting the time and energy necessary for our middle schools.
Rhee said the District needs to continue finding better ways to address the needs of underperforming students.
This fall, for example, some teachers are being trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at upper-grade elementary and middle school students who did not master the fundamentals of early reading in their school courses and are considerably behind their peers.
Everyday math, a math curriculum from kindergarten through sixth grade that emphasizes games and real-life experiences, was introduced to the District under former superintendent Clifford Janey, who is credited with some of the progress reported by the ENPE last week.
I just think we have to keep working to deliver the best interventions to those students who are below grade level,” Rhee said.
Others say the ENPE results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to increase overall system performance and still provide additional money and resources for underperforming schools, which will be needed to narrow the gap.
Here’s a kind of lurid dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, an education professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who studies urban test scores.
The conventional policy solution is to allocate its resources and administration reforms to schools located in the poorest sections of D.C.
Then the goal can generate political repercussions that go against that important schedule.
But the problem, of course, is that, like other urban superintendents, she tries to hold on to the black and white middle class.
Our focus is on ensuring that we build a system of excellent schools.
We need to strengthen our neighbourhood schools, so that all families, regardless of where they live, have confidence that their children can access an excellent public education.
Janey, now superintendent of Newark schools, said in an interview this week that an essential element in closing the performance gap is extending the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the District, to compete with charter schools.
It takes nearly 200 days to have the force of change, said Janey, who struck a deal with her teachers’ union last year in a 185-day year, which she sees as an “indicator” to look for a bigger increase in the next convention.
Making higher education a part of more futures
The tour bus arrived at the University of Gettysburg with a loud roar.
12-year-old Graciela Rodriguez came down and blinked for a moment at the white columns, brick facades and emerald meadows.
Graciela’s parents had just graduated from a high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Still, when she and the other eighth graders in the group explored Gettysburg, where tuition costs $38,690 a year, her attitude was less that of impressed guests than that of enthusiastic potential students.
"Yes, that's where I'll be!" exclaimed Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the guide announced that they had entered the science building.
Man, seriously, he said thoughtfully, when the guide talked about the school’s low teacher-to-student ratio.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh the children had visited on their three-day trip, and they had already completely absorbed his deliberate message: The question is not whether you’re going to college.
The question is which one.
While there is growing concern about the large number of U.S.-born children of Hispanic immigrants who drop out of high school or become pregnant in their teens, there are also hundreds of thousands who access college education they need to access the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these “second-generation” Hispanics graduate from college, a remarkable achievement given that many of their immigrant parents, especially Mexicans and Central Americans, entered the United States without finishing high school.
Their success stories are important, the researchers say, because they point the way forward for a generation that will play a major role in the country’s workforce.
Those who analyze the highest performers say they often have a natural affinity for school and an innate tendency to succeed.
Many also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their unfamiliarity with American schools.
But mentoring programs can also play an exceptional role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to college, particularly if efforts are sustained over time.
Looking at low-income children, whose parents don’t have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, it follows that any intervention at any time isn’t going to fix it, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who has examined Latino students.
We need to think about providing a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded the Graciela University tour is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million per year to local school systems to run college readiness programs, which begin when low-income students are in middle school and continue through high school.
Since 1999, the program has helped more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent attending college, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraqi Oil Ministry Reaches Agreements with 10 Foreign Oil Companies
Despite concerns over violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to lure major oil companies to rebuild its fragile infrastructure, during two auctions that concluded on Saturday.
The 10 agreements the Iraqi oil ministry reached with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are poised to play a leading role in restoring Iraq’s oil industry, crippled by decades of war and sanctions.
U.S. companies walked away having bid on only two of the 10 sites auctioned.
Seven U.S. companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began Friday.
The only one who submitted an offer lost.
Two U.S. companies reached agreements for auctioned deposits in June.
The poor representation of U.S. oil giants in the opening of Iraq’s oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, there are Asians and Europeans at the helm, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an online news center.
It will be a long time before something else is on offer in Iraq.
Security concerns, accentuated by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability as the U.S. military pulls out, likely prevented U.S. oil companies from taking a more aggressive risk in Iraq, which has the world’s third-largest crude reserves, analysts said.
U.S. companies were in some cases at a disadvantage, because rivals, particularly Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, have considerably lower labor costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not answer to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc were the only U.S. companies to reach agreements with the ministry.
Major U.S. firms, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have tightened ties with the Iraqi oil ministry and provided technical advice in recent years, walked away empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main protagonists in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The Chinese state-owned National Petroleum Corporation offered more contracts than any other company and secured large investments in contracts for two major fields.
We know that China is on its way to becoming a major economic and technological power, Oil Ministry spokesman Assam Jihad said.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be on par with its competitors and deliver on its commitments to Iraq.
The companies shortlisted to submit proposals made bids that were then confronted with the subsidy per barrel that the ministry was willing to pay to increase production above current levels at each site.
Al Qaeda’s top planner has apparently been killed in Pakistan
A suspected U.S. missile strike on Pakistan's border with Afghanistan is believed to have killed a top al Qaeda operations planner this week, U.S. counterterrorism officials said on Friday.
If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack on a high-ranking terrorist leader this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men thought to have died on Tuesday when a pair of missiles hit his car near the town of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani officials in the region.
Local officials said the missiles were launched by an unidentified aircraft, of the type operated by the CIA within Pakistan’s illegal tribal area.
They were driving a white car, heading for the Afghan border, when the car was hit, said an official from Pakistan’s civilian intelligence agency, speaking by phone from Miran Shah.
The official said suspected local militants rushed to the scene and quickly confiscated what was left of the “totally shattered bodies.”
Local authorities were unable to verify the identities of the victims, but two U.S. counterterrorism officials cited unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as a high-ranking al Qaeda military planner, who directed the terror group’s operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He went on to conspire around the world, said a senior official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, citing the delicate nature of U.S. airstrikes inside Pakistani territory.
Considering its central role, this likely included conspiratorial attacks against the United States and Europe.
He had strategic guidance from al Qaeda’s top command and translated it into operational patterns for potential terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said Somali had risen rapidly in the ranks of al Qaeda and was well connected with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be a household name for some Americans, but that in no way lessens the threat it posed to us and our allies, the second official said.
If confirmed, Somali would be the second al Qaeda leader or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area, and three other high-ranking operatives.
The pace of CIA-led drone attacks has declined since the summer, from an average of about six operations a month to two, according to a tally from The Long War Journal, a website run by a nonprofit.
The decline is perhaps due to an improved tactic by terrorist groups, which have taken steps to limit their vulnerability while ruthlessly murdering suspected informants, the site said.
Top UN envoy in Kabul about to resign
The top U.N. envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday he would step down in March, ending a tumultuous term that was marred by allegations of widespread corruption in Afghanistan’s U.N.-backed presidential election.
Eide’s departure comes as the Obama administration has decided to send an additional 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The U.N. envoy said he supports the increase but is concerned that the U.S. timetable for military withdrawal starting in 18 months will push other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the preparation of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to Afghans so they can trust the international community, Eide said in a phone interview from Kabul.
The commitment has to be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also lobbied the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian officials to assist Afghanistan's political transition.
The increase in the military sector has to be reflected in the civilian sector, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning, but simply keeping a promise he made to his family in March 2008 to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to notify the Secretary.
UN General Ban Ki-moon, so that he would have time to find a replacement.
“What I’ve said is that it’s better that they start looking for a successor,” Eide said.
When I arrived here, there was a gap of two months between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
Ban has begun looking for a replacement, according to U.N. officials.
Officials say they have been considering Staffan di Mistura, a Swedish-Italian citizen who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led UN peacekeeping missions.
Eide’s position in Afghanistan was put to the test before his former delegate, Peter W. Galbraith, who accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the country’s presidential vote and covering up evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied the allegations, but said the allegations by Galbraith, who was fired, "certainly hurt the mission, because there was already a lot of skepticism about international interference" in the election.
Eide said he proposed the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate assistance efforts by U.S.-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also pushed the UN leadership to allow his successor to hire more personnel from the United States and other Western countries, which lend themselves to the Afghan mission, stating that this would increase their confidence that their money is being used correctly.
Eide expressed frustration at the limitations to his powers in Afghanistan, arguing that the UN’s cumbersome hiring regulations undermine his ability to attract talent.
Such is the case that the UN rules allowed me to recruit only one person since May, he said.
That is catastrophic and cannot continue.
Gates: Iran will face additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said on Friday that world powers would soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran for its failure to engage in talks about its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, addressing a group of about 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq during a week-long trip to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, played down the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There are no good options in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier’s question about the likelihood of such an event.
One of the things that weighs on me is that, if we have learned anything from Iraq over the last six years, it is the inherent unpredictability of war.
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions aimed at Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates noted that some sanctions could also affect the broader Iranian population.
He argued that it would take “a package of incentives and disincentives,” “to persuade the Iranian government that they would actually be less safe with nuclear weapons,” because “their people will suffer enormously” from the sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders in warning that Iran will face “credible” consequences if its nuclear program does not fully respect the indications of the UN Security Council and its nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists it wants to develop nuclear knowledge only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on Oct. 1, he said he would renegotiate on restricting its nuclear program and agree to leave a substantial portion of its stockpile of enriched uranium in exchange for desperately needed fuel for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed for such a deal, as a way to build trust between the two sides and buy time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran appears to have moved away from tentative deals, in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided over whether to compromise with the United States.
“Frankly, I think Iran’s hardening with the international community on some proposals that they actually accepted in early October has united the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, in a way that they haven’t been in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians,” Gates said.
President Obama has set a Dec. 31 deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals, before rethinking other options, including pursuing what Foreign Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton once called “devastating sanctions.”
In a statement made in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what it called "baseless and unfounded allegations" Thursday by some Security Council members about Iran's nuclear activities, and said it is willing to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers, "in order to achieve an appropriate, long-term solution."
Gates, who was due to return to Washington last Friday, met Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki in the morning before flying to the oil-rich Kurdish region of Iraq to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions remain high between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and co-participation.
Gates urged both sides to decrease the potential for conflict, to avoid any delay in U.S. plans, to reduce the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to ease Kurdish anxiety about the pending drawdown, with U.S. officials quoting Gates' words to Massoud Barzani, the chairman of Kurdistan's Regional Government: "We will preserve your security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq.
We will not abandon them."
In an ageing China, a change of course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters lecturing them about the fact that “Mother Earth is too tired to support more children” and “one more baby means one more grave.”
They learned the lesson so well that when Shanghai government officials, alarmed by their city’s low birth rate and aging population, suddenly changed course this summer and began incentivizing young couples to have more than one child, their reaction was instant and firm: No way.
We have already given all our time and energy just to one child.
We have nothing left for a second, said Wang, 31, a human resources manager with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the one-child policy was introduced in China, creating two generations of notoriously chubby, spoiled one-child children, affectionately dubbed “little emperors,” a demographic crisis is emerging in the country.
The median birth rate has plummeted to 1.8 children per couple, down from six when the policy became effective, according to the Division of Child Welfare.
UN demographic, while the number of residents aged 60 and over is projected to explode from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent by 2050. This is well above the global average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is worse in wealthy coastal cities with highly educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 percent of Shanghai’s registered residents, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission, said fertile couples should have babies to “help reduce the proportion of the aging population and alleviate a future labor shortage.”
Shanghai is about to be “as old (not as rich, however) as developed countries like Japan and Sweden,” he said.
Gradual relief
Drafted into the country’s constitution in 1978, China’s one-child policy is arguably the most contentious mandate introduced to date by the Communist Party.
Couples who violate the policy face huge fines, up to three times their annual salary in some areas, and employment discrimination.
Chinese officials have endorsed the policy for its contribution to avoiding critical pressure on its natural resources, while human rights defenders have denounced abuses in enforcing the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women with a second child to undergo abortions.
In addition, many couples have performed abortions according to the sex of the fetus, leading to a high unnatural male-female ratio.
In recent years, demographic officials have gradually softened their stance on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule, including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities, and cases in which both husband and wife are only children, and in 2007 they tempered many of their hard-line slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at Peking University’s Demographic Research Institute, said central government officials have recently been discussing even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one spouse is an only child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost overnight, posters ordering families to have a single child were replaced with copies of regulations detailing who would be eligible to have a second child and how to apply for a permit.
The city government sent family planning officials and volunteers to visit couples in their homes and slip leaflets under doors.
She has also promised to provide emotional and financial guidance to those who have chosen to have more than one child.
Family planning officials say the response has been very little overwhelming.
Disappointing response
Although officials in a rural city on the outskirts of Shanghai said they saw a moderate increase in applications from couples who want a second child after the launch of the campaign, more urban districts indicated no change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, is still receiving only four to five applications per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that, despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still only expected to reach around 165,000, slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of Caolu Township in Shanghai, said financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want more children.
They want to give their best to their first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally qualified to do so.
But like many Chinese, they have only insufficient health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a social safety net, they argue, that option would be irresponsible.
People in the West incorrectly see the one-child policy as a matter of rights, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple’s first child.
Yes, we are being robbed of the possibility of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just a political issue.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their doubts.
Wang, the human resources manager, said she wants an only child because she was also an only child: “We were the center of our families and we were used to everyone taking care of us.
We’re not used to taking care of others and we don’t really want to take care of others.”
Chen Zijian, 42, owner of a translation agency, explained it more forcefully.
For parents with two, middle-class careers that lower the birth rate, he said, it’s about being successful enough to be selfish.
People in their 20s and 30s grew up watching their parents struggle during the early days of China’s experiment with capitalism and they don’t want that kind of life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child requires a lot of parental time, he said.
A mother has to give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are space issues, "you have to remodel your apartment", and the strategic "you have to have a curriculum prepared for the best nurseries when the child is 9 months old."
Most of his friends are willing to face this once, Chen said, but not twice.
Ours is the first generation with the highest standard of living, he said.
We don’t want to make too many sacrifices.
A UN group outlines a plan to reduce emissions
The UN-sponsored climate conference, characterized so far by defiant stances and mutual recriminations, drew renewed attention on Friday with the release of a document that envisions ambitious greenhouse gas reductions over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations carrying most of the burden in the short term.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles and highlighted the way forward.
But it was seen as a major breakthrough in a negotiation that is running out of time, with more than 100 world leaders arriving in Copenhagen next week.
Drafted by an ad hoc working group of the UN, the text does not talk about how much money rich countries would give to the poor to deal with global warming in the short and long term.
And this offers a variety of options for key questions, including how developed economies and major emerging economies would cut their coal output, and what would be the limit of the global temperature rise that political strategists would be willing to tolerate.
This gives a lot of flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, senior representative in Washington for the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, summarized a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what U.N. climate chief Yvo de Boer described as “the big picture.”
It shows the outlines for a possible deal, in which industrialized nations would collectively cut their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020, compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries would cut theirs over the same period by 15 to 30 percent.
Together, countries would cut emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union also spurred talks on Friday, pledging to provide $3.6 billion annually over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the impact of climate change, from floods and droughts to deforestation.
Anyway, Friday featured the same kind of verbal fireworks that dominated the talks last week.
U.S. special climate envoy Todd Stern rejected claims calling for mandatory cuts in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialized countries, compared with volunteers from major emerging economies, if they were not funded by the developed world.
The move indicated that the Obama administration is taking a harder line with China than Bush administration officials did just two years ago.
The United States will not make a deal without major developing countries moving forward and taking action, said Stern, who also regretted that the text did not do enough to ensure that the cuts could be verified by outside observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei said the top U.S. climate negotiator lacked “common sense,” or was “very irresponsible” for saying earlier in the week that the United States would not help China economically cope with global warming.
With the future economic trajectory of the world’s major powers at stake, fault lines have erupted both within the developing world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is both to save individual economies and to save the planet, with China and the United States clashing over their respective obligations, while the poorest nations insist that the world’s twenty-four most influential countries are ignoring the scientific imperative to take bolder action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it was not surprising that major powers were discussing who should pay for limiting greenhouse gases, even as vulnerable countries have become more aggressive in seeking to hold big emitters accountable for their actions.
This is clearly a game where a new economic hegemony is developing, said Ulate, who also works as a regional climate change advisor for Mexico and Central America, for Conservation International.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated they would continue to push for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most major participants say the talks will produce at most a political agreement.
The 43-member Alliance of Small Island States drafted a preliminary 24-page treaty proposal early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said the push by small island nations has “put political pressure on the entire political process,” in part because they are now unified and demand action from emerging economies such as China and India.
The talks took on a new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that they must resolve most exceptional issues before heads of government reach a deal.
High-level officials, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and China’s deputy minister, got off the planes and rushed to the halls of the Bella Center, to closed-door meetings and press conferences, to be able to delimit the claims that will be arbitrated during the next week.
The sheer clutter of the meeting (where every day 13,000 people enter and leave the convention center, the guitar-playing activists present nightly shows mocking the countries they claim are selling, and preliminary proposals are passed from hand to hand instead of via mail), poses a challenge.
Intensity only builds: almost all the key ministers are here right now, and on Wednesday 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We’re entering the major leagues,” said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president for global policy at Conservation International.
The heavyweights are coming.
Britain's first 225km train redefines Monday sentiment
At 5.13 on Monday morning, a whistle will pierce the darkness to signal a train departure that marks a revolution for travel in Britain.
The country’s first high-speed intercity train will reach 225km/h when it flashes from Ashford, Kent, to London’s St Panrcas station, covering 93km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Secretary of Transport, will then be joined by Lady Kelly Holmes, aboard the first Javelin intercity service outside London.
He hopes the new service will finally connect Britain to an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the great conurbations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
Neglected outlying areas would become thriving suburbs, business travel times would be shortened, and switching from planes and cars to rail would reduce national coal emissions, as well as ease congestion on the roads.
In theory, all three major political parties believe in this view.
But the tens of billions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable battle of planning and fears about environmental damage, can still hold back Britain’s high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company set up in January to provide the government with a feasibility study, will hand over its report to Lord Adonis on Dec. 30, the Times learned.
This will provide you with a detailed itinerary of the next stage planned for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn within a five-metre radius in urban areas and areas where the environmental impact could be contentious.
In rural areas, the plan will be drawn within a radius of 25 meters of a definitive route.
HS2 is also expected to set three options for a wider high-speed network heading north.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The favored option being proposed is a Y-shaped configuration, in which a single high-speed line would reach the West Midlands.
The line would be divided at or near Birmingham, with one branch heading west from the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland, and another north-east to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would enter Scotland.
"It looks like this will be the most beneficial option," said one member of the railroad.
Once completed, travel times between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first leg, which would not open until 2025, would allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to just over an hour today.
The proposals would allow trains to travel at 402km/h, making the UK network the fastest in Europe.
The initial track is being designed to support 400-metre-long trains, capable of carrying 1,100 people.
At least 18 trains could operate every hour on a London-Birmingham line.
This means that a London terminal capable of receiving 20,000 passengers per hour would be needed.
Considering the capital’s space constraints, an existing station is expected to be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Experts in the rail industry argue that only St Pancras International or Euston station offers that potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he believes the scheme should proceed, but extensive public consultation and planning procedures mean a final decision will not be made until after a general election.
Even if you start the work, the network would have to be built in sections.
Trains would initially be forced to leave express lines on existing lanes north of Birmingham, keeping travel times between London and Scotland above three hours.
This is seen as the crucial point needed to ensure a switch from planes to trains, a benchmark for the railway revolution.
Taxpayers face mortgage for <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 orange grove from a Conservative
Alan Duncan, the Conservative Party spokesman, charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orange grove he built in his constituency home.
The party’s prison spokesman, who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that MPs lived “on rations,” increased his mortgage by <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 to build an oak-framed extension to his second home in Rutland.
They allowed the taxpayer to charge the extra interest, adding up to hundreds of pounds a month.
The House of Commons authorities approved the requests at the time and have not been consulted by Sir Thomas Legg, who is leading a review of members' expenses. Last night Mr Duncan said the requests "could not have been clearer or simpler".
Mr. Duncan, one of the wealthiest Members of Parliament, owns a two-story house in a village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
Nearby houses have sold for nearly a million pounds.
The ground floor comprises a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the fee office agreed that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year he added a greenhouse to the house, described in the plans as an “orange tree.”
Neighbors described it as “a greenhouse for entertainment.”
Mr Duncan was not asked to make any reference to the loan increase during a recent House of Commons Standards and Privileges Committee investigation into his previous mortgage settlements.
Last month the committee acquitted him of violating the rules, following an investigation of his expenses.
In 2004, Mr Duncan changed the legal guarantee for a <0xC2><0xA3>271,406 mortgage from his London property to his constituency house, which he had bought in 1991, the year before he became a Member of Parliament.
Documents released this week show that Mr Duncan was applying for approximately <0xC2><0xA3>1,400 a month in mortgage interest, up until March last year.
In April, their applications increased to more than <0xC2><0xA3>1,800 per month.
The interest rate on Mr Duncan’s Royal Bank of Scotland mortgage did not change at the time, suggesting that the entire increase would finance the <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 loan.
The standard variable mortgage rate of the BRE fell from 7.94% in December 2007 to 4% in March this year, the rate at which it is now.
The most recent document issued by House of Commons authorities shows that Mr Duncan was still applying for <0xC2><0xA3>1,250 per month in May.
Mr Duncan lost his job as opposition speaker of the House in September after an undercover reporter filmed him saying MPs had to survive "on rations" after the spending scandal.
"Basically this is being nationalized, you have to live on rations and be treated like shit."
He said: “I spend my money on my garden and ask for a small fraction based on what is appropriate.
And I could ask for a lot more, but I don’t.”
The MP, a millionaire for his former profession as an oil trader, was first questioned about his spending in May, when it turned out that he had applied for thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the salary office that this “could be considered excessive”.
An activist dug a hole in the shape of the pound symbol on Mr Duncan’s lawn in protest, after it was revealed that he applied for <0xC2><0xA3>4,000 over three years.
Last night, when asked about the mortgage increase, Mr. Duncan said, “It was for major improvements, approved both by the wages office and subsequently by Legg.”
He added: “It’s not about evading and offending or breaking the rules or whatever.
This is absolutely within the bounds, according to the rules, authorized and all.
It couldn’t be any clearer or simpler.”
Come those who have faith, to see the calendar of the Advent of the palapa of the beach of Brighton
Brighton palapas have found a new boost for the winter months in an interactive Advent calendar.
In addition, an alternative religious group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their palapas for each December day, using carols as their theme.
The event began on December 1, with guests being able to see the last palapa from 5:30pm to 6:30pm every day, with stuffed cakes and punch served for free.
The carols chosen so far include Vi Tres Barcos, Oh Ven, Oh Ven, Emanuel and La Primera Navidad, where the palapa presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an unpaid clergyman from the Diocese of Chichester and the leader of Beyond.
He stated, “We want religion to be more relevant to people, in a post-Christian society.”
"Why do we as a Church expect people to come to a strange old building? I believe the Church should come to people and celebrate in exciting ways.
“The idea of the Palapa Advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends over dinner.
Brighton is an incredibly creative and vibrant place and we’re trying to prove and represent that through spirituality.”
Massive climate mobilisation in Copenhagen and around the world
Tens of thousands of protesters rallied on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding deal to fight global warming, around the world and in Copenhagen, where police detained several hundred people.
Some 30,000 people, according to police; hundreds of thousands, according to organizers, marched through the icy Danish capital demanding an agreement to be reached by the United Nations Conference on Climate Change by Friday, which would take effect on January 1, 2013.
Connie Hedegaard, the Danish chair of the climate conference, said the growing climate mobilisation around the world, represented by these demonstrations, contributed to the “political price” of a failure in Copenhagen being very high.
The incidents erupted shortly after the start of the demonstration in the Danish capital, when a group of 300 people, all dressed in black, smashed shop windows with cobblestones and hammers, an AFP journalist reported.
The riot police intervened quickly and firmly.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people in total, according to her, these are especially members of the "Black Blocs", ultra-violent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in the east of France, last April.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the organizers of the demonstration, denounced the conditions in which hundreds of militants were detained "without distinction", stressing that a hundred of them "were immobilized in the street on Saturday night handcuffed and seated despite the intense cold".
The demonstration, quite peaceful, left the Parliament and took to the Bella Center, headquarters of the negotiations.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to enter.
A stage was set up to welcome the invited speakers, with former South African Archbishop of Cape Town Desmond Tutu leading a candlelight vigil.
Most of the protesters arrived by bus and train from major European cities, but many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present, as were some Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in sky raincoats, responded by forming a first morning rally in Copenhagen to Friends of the Earth’s call to form “blue tides” for “justice and climate.”
Today we take to the streets to ask for compensation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can no longer say: there is time, said the Beninese singer Angélique Kidjo.
In Africa, there are rivers that dry up, waterways that you can walk through like you’ve never been able to do before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, created in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalization movement approached environmental organizations.
The French MEP José Bové, a figure of anti-globalization, explained that he came to Copenhagen to "unite climate justice and social justice": "today the fight against global warming is not opposed to the fight for another world".
The Asia-Pacific region, which brings together numerous islands that are highly vulnerable to warming, kicked off the demonstrations.
According to organizers, about 50,000 people took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, more than a hundred people, mostly students, paraded dressed in red and wearing handkerchiefs with slogans in favor of solar energy.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, as well as in Canada, hundreds of demonstrators have formed to take strong action against climate change.
In France, demonstrations organized by the "350" network gathered hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, dozens of people gathered.
Separatist Abkhazia elected president, although Georgia denounces "fraud"
This Saturday Abkhazia, a pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia recognized by Moscow more than a year ago, elected president; however, Tbilisi denounces "fraud".
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election after the Russo-Georgian War in August 2008 for control of South Ossetia, another Georgian breakaway region recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 17:00 GMT.
According to officials of the Abkhaz Election Commission, turnout was 58 percent a few hours before the closure.
The first provisional results would be announced Saturday night through Sunday.
The five candidates in the race, including outgoing President Sergei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which disapproved of the ballot.
This election is a farce.
Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili "regrets that Abkhazia has fallen under full Russian occupation," his spokesman Manana Manjgaladze said.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
Following its separation from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict that ended with several thousand deaths, Abkhazia is trying to demonstrate through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage of our new life, our new era as an independent state, said Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, who claimed to have voted for Bagapch.
She was among the voters who headed to the polling station at a school in the capital, Soukhoumi, a pretty white building with palm trees at the entrance.
The theme of Russian domination is the central theme of the presidential election in this region with sumptuous landscapes, on the shores of the Black Sea.
Large boards show Bagapch alongside Russian President and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin at different locations in this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the west of the country, the head of the district, Beslan Archba, warmly welcomed the Russian officials who came to control the development of the scrutiny.
In a brief ceremony, he said: We, the people of Abkhazia, appreciate Moscow’s support, and most particularly, the decision to recognize Abkhazia’s independence.
I hope that your country will be quickly recognized by the United Nations, replied Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian parliament, raising his glass of vodka.
For its part, the opposition represented in the election by former Vice President Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticizes the agreements signed with Moscow last year, such as the one that gives Russia control of the Abkhaz railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, maintains that he does not support the current power or the opposition.
It takes a 50% majority plus one vote to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a runoff will be held two weeks later.
Climate: demonstrations around the world, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people took to the streets of the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement at the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference, where police, on alert, arrested more than 700 people around an imposing demonstration.
About 30,000 people, according to police; hundreds of thousands, according to organizers, marched in the afternoon amid the cold of the Danish capital, which hosts until December 18 delegates from 193 countries, in search of an agreement that should enter into force on January 1, 2013.
The demonstration, quite peaceful, left the Parliament and took to the Bella Center, where negotiations are taking place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the center, without trying to enter.
A stage was set up to welcome the invited speakers, with former South African Archbishop of Cape Town Desmond Tutu leading a candlelight vigil.
Moments after the demonstration began, a group of hundreds of people, all dressed in black, smashed shop windows with bricks and hammers, an AFP journalist reported.
Riot police quickly surrounded them and intervened firmly, throwing several of them to the ground.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, specifying that they were mainly members of the "Black Blocs", ultra-violent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, last April.
Late in the afternoon, a police officer was injured in the jaw with a cobblestone, and four cars were set on fire near an occupied house during the incidents that led to the arrest of about twenty people, according to police.
We did not take our eyes off the extremist groups, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen warned as law enforcement helicopters flew over the area.
Most of the protesters, who arrived by bus and train from the big cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam, even Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present, as were some Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in sky raincoats, responded by forming a first morning rally in Copenhagen to Friends of the Earth’s call to form “blue tides” for “justice and climate.”
Today we take to the streets to ask for compensation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

French MEP José Bové, a figure of anti-globalization, told AFP that he came to Copenhagen to "unite climate justice and social justice": "today the fight against global warming is not opposed to the fight for another world".
The Oxfam organization along with the former UN commissioner for refugees, Mary Robinson, who was to lead the crowd, mobilized several celebrities, including the Danish model Helena Christensen.
The Asia-Pacific region, which brings together numerous islands that are highly vulnerable to warming, kicked off the demonstrations.
According to organizers, about 5,000 people took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, hundreds of people, mostly students, demonstrated dressed in red and wearing handkerchiefs with slogans in favor of solar energy in front of the City Hall of the Philippine capital.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, hundreds of demonstrators gathered to protest climate change.
In France, demonstrations organized by the "350" network gathered hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, dozens of people gathered.
The subject of history and geography comes out reinforced from the reform of secondary education, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education, Luc Chatel, stated in an interview that will be broadcast in the Sunday News (JDD, according to its French acronym) that history and geography would be "strengthened" from the reform of general secondary education, despite being eliminated from compulsory education in the second year of scientific baccalaureate.
From now on, all students in the first year of high school will have four hours a week and the same program for a shared common culture, says Chatel.
For the Minister, "enough with hypocrisy" because, according to him, "branch C is no longer a scientific branch", but "in general, it summons the best students".
The General and Literary Education branches cannot be sub-branches of the C, he goes on to stress: "I also did not hear that historians or intellectuals were indignant at having eliminated history and geography in the second year of high school in the technological schools".
An IFOP poll published on Saturday in L’Humanité revealed that approximately seven out of ten French people (69%) disapproved of the government’s plan to eliminate the compulsory teaching of history-geography in the second grade of high school C. Numerous intellectuals and teachers, the left and some right-wing elected representatives also criticized this fact.
Instead, the Minister added that “there is no talk” of eliminating philosophy from the C-level second-year program.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and unions) called for a day of mobilization on Tuesday to protest against the project, which they say sacrifices the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), at the beginning of the year they will take an admission test that will aim at their discipline, and at the end of the year, an admission test about their ability to teach, explained the Minister.
In addition, they will do internships in real conditions during the year of M2, then they will be a first year in front of the classroom as teachers in internships.
If you do all the practices proposed before the competition, you will already have a great experience in front of the classroom, that is, more than 300 hours, he added.
Finally, the Minister points out that he is going to propose "the individual right to training, which does not exist in national education".
He also confirmed the project to remove the school map "before 2012".
At the Ecole Normale Supérieure, experts will have 15 minutes to convincingly explain the evolution of the climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about the challenges of the Copenhagen summit, a challenge that Jean Jouzel, vice president of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) invited by the Ulm Street Higher Normal School, accepted on Saturday morning.
Jean Jouzel, also a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, opened the "Ernest" conference, a day composed of a series of fifteen-minute expert presentations, filmed and open to the public, an AFP journalist reported.
We wanted to do something that would attract people and convey a desire to know more, explained Edouard Hannezzo, 22, one of the organizers of this day called as the students baptized the fish in the school pond.
We chose about twenty participants from among the experts in their discipline and selected them for their charismatic side, he said.
About global warming, "we can talk for hours, but we can also talk about key targets in a few minutes," Jean Jouzel, who exposed without notes but with the help of graphs in front of about fifty people, told AFP.
It is part of our scientific role, he stressed, hoping that the public will understand that "the Copenhagen conference is founded on an extremely serious scientific dossier".
Videos filmed during those conferences will be online on the school’s website beginning Dec. 15.
The next "Ernest" conference is scheduled for February, followed by others at a bimonthly pace.
Delay in payments: disgust among prison guards, planned to take action
Prison guard unions on Friday called for a "general mobilization" to demand payment before the holidays, bonuses and overtime, which was postponed until January for budgetary reasons.
The Workers’ Prison Force (2nd Guards Union) asked off-duty staff to join the demonstration Tuesday morning in front of the prisons and “block” them to denounce the theft of their belongings.
The CGT penitentiary (3rd trade union of the profession) calls on them to "meet in general assemblies in the different prisons to achieve a mass mobilization", as it calls the non-payment in December of the "overtime, night bonuses, Sundays and holidays" worked in October "shameful and unacceptable".
And the first union of guards, the Federal Autonomous Penitentiary Union (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for general mobilization (...) in order to increase discontent and anger".
The Directorate of Prison Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that overtime increased a lot in 2009 and not all were counted, but they assure that the balance will be paid in January.
At the end of the day, the Foreign Ministry reported that Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the guard unions guaranteeing that the payment would be made next month.
I have no doubt of the efforts made by the staff for the functioning and modernization of our penitentiary system, writes the Minister of Justice in this letter.
I asked the Directorate of Prison Administration to immediately implement a set of measures aimed at ensuring that this situation generated by a poor evaluation of the number of overtime hours does not occur again in the future.
The December payment will then be low, except for management personnel who enjoy the benefit of the famous function and objective bonuses, and who "always blame the budgetary demands", deplored the Ufap / Unsa.
It is a real scandal, said outraged the interregional union FO of Marseille, announcing its decision to boycott until new order "all meetings and convocations".
The staff will not come to work on Sundays and corresponding holidays if those of the month of October are not paid in December, the same will happen with overtime, also threatens FO Rh<0xC3><0xB4>ne-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when we are increasing our tasks and missions without taking on more personnel, it is more than regrettable to dare to attack the salary of the staff, the CGT penitentiary of Bordeaux estimates.
According to the unions, not all regions are the same, as some are more fortunate than others.
But in any case, the result is not as expected, said the secretary general of the Ufap, Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Forget.
For Christmas, Obama Says He Makes 'Better Gifts' Than He Gets
U.S. President Barack Obama, who will celebrate his first family Christmas at the White House, confessed to the famous television presenter, Oprah Winfrey, who came to a simple conclusion regarding gifts: "I make better gifts than I receive."
During a special interview that ABC will air on Sunday night, the President and his wife Michelle explain how they plan to celebrate the holidays in their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, the family’s little four-legged companion, will be of the game.
Santa also loves Bo, Michelle Obama said, clarifying that the dog will “of course” receive a gift, according to excerpts from the program broadcast in advance.
And Michelle Obama disagreed with her husband’s claims about the quality of the gifts she receives: “No way, last year I gave you nice gifts,” she said teasing the president.
True, he was forced to admit it before answering humorously pointing to the First Lady’s pearl necklace: “Who gave you that?”
During the hour-long interview, in a relaxed atmosphere with the famous cheerleader who devoutly supported Barack Obama’s presidential campaign, the president and his wife also recalled their favorite childhood gifts.
Barack Obama recalled a two-speed bicycle, as well as a basketball that his Kenyan father, who he rarely saw, gave him for Christmas.
I remember that time when my father came to see us at Christmas and gave me a basketball, the President said.
Only many years later, I found out that he had given me that ball.
For her part, the First Lady remembered her dollhouse.
I had no idea how to organize a house, so I put all the furniture in line against the wall, instead of fitting it around the home, yet I loved that dollhouse, Michelle Obama said.
Johnny Hallyday Re-Operated, RTL Claims He's In Induced Coma
Johnny Hallyday was intervened again in Los Angeles due to important "injuries" derived from an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his relatives, while RTL claims that the singer was subjected to an induced coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was operated on again Wednesday night at Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> hospital in Los Angeles where some doctors checked "injuries arising from the operation" of herniated discs performed in Paris on November 26, said his press service in the same city, indicating that such injuries "needed a repair operation."
However, the singer's press service tried to convey reassurance that the situation was "under control", and reported that a new medical party would communicate within the next 48 hours.
According to RTL, sponsor of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday agreed, however, to undergo an induced coma to avoid "pain and complications".
In less than 48 hours when the patient wakes up, we will have more certainty about their condition, adds RTL.
The press service, questioned by AFP, did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also claims that "according to some sources" no cannula was introduced after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated on at the international clinic in Monceau Park due to a herniated disc.
The intervention, scheduled for a few days, was practiced by the neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor in the artistic environment.
On Thursday night, Delajoux declined to comment on the information transmitted by RTL.
Singer Johnny Hollyday was admitted Monday to Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> Hospital in Los Angeles for an infection stemming from Delajoux’s surgery.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, explained on Thursday on RTL that his friend was going through "a bad time", but said that there was "no problem" because the rocker is "a fighter".
“He called me just before he traveled to Los Angeles, and I told him it was silly to fly 12 hours after such an operation, it’s not possible,” Mitchell said.
On Wednesday night, the musician's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, sought to reassure by stating that Johnny Hallyday, "reacted satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection was "controlled".
Camus said he had spoken to Laeticia, the musician's wife, and that he had not noticed any particular concerns.
But the singer's health problems have multiplied since July when he was hospitalized for nine days in the wake of a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, to general surprise, Johnny Hallyday revealed that he had been operated on from a "colon cancer" after a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed, as planned, his long "Gira 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem has been over-reported, with fans and journalists noting the musician’s difficulty moving on stage.
In mid-November, his relatives even had to deny a new internment.
Euro-2009/short pool: Bousquet's first title in his favourite distance
France’s Frédérick Bousquet, a three-time medalist at the 2009 World Championships in long-distance swimming, won an international title at a distance he is particularly fond of, 50m freestyle, during Euro 2009 in Istanbul’s short-distance swimming.
On the first day of this competition in which polyurethane swimsuits were allowed for the last time, only three world records were broken when in reality many more were expected.
One was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto in 200 m 4 styles; and the other two, by the Russian in relief 4 x 50 m 4 styles (male).
A pity for Bousquet, who coveted the world record in 50 m freestyle, mark that owns in long pool (20.94).
In one of the two queen distances of swimming, in 50 m free, the 28-year-old Frenchman won with 20''53 during a final where ten swimmers competed instead of eight as usual, an international first.
Bousquet overtook Croatia’s Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russia’s Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but failed to drop the world record (20.30) as planned.
We can always aspire to something better and, in that case, I already said that if the world record was within my reach, I would try to achieve it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers wore polyurethane swimsuits that will be banned from January 1.
These swimsuits, origin of 238 world records since February 2008, finish their epic in Istanbul, where they competed for the first time in 1999 for the same event.
This time the use of the swimsuits did not help the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in long pool this summer in Rome, consecutive world records.
The young swimmer did not manage to drop his mark in 400 m freestyle (3:32.77), however, he won with the second best time of his career (3:34.55), against the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't give myself up in this race.
I knew that this time I wouldn’t be able to break a world record, but I managed to defend my title and fulfilled my mission.
Lobintsev will be a tough rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
U.S.: A sarcophagus panel that belonged to Zola sold for $1.5 million
A Roman sarcophagus panel belonging to French writer Emile Zola sold for $1.5 million on Thursday, well above the estimated price, the Sotheby's art dealer announced.
This panel, 2 meters long by 63 cm high, dates from the 3rd century AD, and its price had been estimated between 150,000 and 250,000 dollars.
The marble "representing four Dionysian scenes, in a sophisticated architectural setting, surrounded by satyrs and drunken women, is an unusual piece, as in the world there are only four or five," Florent Heintz, vice president of art auctions for ancient Rome and Egypt at Sotheby's, told AFP on Tuesday.
It was sold among a hundred lots.
The sale continues, but so far, this lot was the most bid by buyers, without a doubt, told AFP a spokesman for Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy.
Just a few days ago, it was discovered that the marble was an acquisition by Emile Zola.
For almost 300 years, the panel was part of the famous collection of the Borges family in Rome, then it appeared successively in the house of the French actress Cécile Sorel, as an element of her bathtub in her private Parisian mansion, and in the house of Paul Raynaud, minister of the Third French Republic and president of the Council for a short time, before Marshal Pétain took power.
For about fifty years, his whereabouts were uncertain.
Reviewing the database of the Louvre Museum, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an "Emile Zola succession" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thér<0xC3><0xA8>se Raquin" and the fresco of the "Rougon-Macquart".
Honduras aborts Zelaya's departure to Mexico
On Thursday, Mexico said conditions were not in place to move ousted Honduran President Manuel Zelaya, who was denied safe passage by the coup government.
At the moment, after an evening telephone conversation with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that there is no possibility of making the transfer, said the Mexican Minister of Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa.
The Mexican government plane that arrived Wednesday in El Salvador to take Zelaya, returned to its place of origin, according to a source from the General Directorate of Migration.
To grant him safe conduct, the coup government wanted to force Zelaya to "renounce" and seek political asylum abroad.
But the ousted president refused because he wanted to come to Mexico as a guest acting head of state.
The coup government "suffered a new defeat by asking me to resign my position (...), they wanted me to present my resignation," Zelaya told Globo radio on Thursday, in which he usually makes statements since the beginning of the political crisis that has been five months in the Central American country.
Here I can stay ten years, I have my guitar, added the deposed president, who has been a refugee in the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months, playing a few chords.
The Mexican embassy presented us with a request for safe conduct, but unfortunately we could not accept it because it did not contain an asylum request, the Interior Minister of the coup government, Oscar Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Matute, told Honduran radio HRN on Wednesday.
I will not ask any country for asylum, Manuel Zelaya replied in an interview on the Telesur network, whose headquarters are in Caracas.
If I leave Honduras, I will do it as president of the Honduran people, he stressed.
Rumors about Zelaya’s departure mobilized supporters of the ousted president on Wednesday, who gathered around the Brazilian embassy, heavily besieged by the military.
The Brazilian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Celso Amorim, criticized the position of the coup government.
That reflects the marginal character of this government in the face of international standards, he said.
Zelaya, who had approached the socialist president of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, was overthrown on June 28, the day he had organized a referendum to prepare for his re-election, rejected by the Supreme Court, the army and the Congress.
Since his exile in Costa Rica, he returned unexpectedly on September 21 and took refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be arrested and must face justice for the crime of "high treason", according to the coup government.
The de facto president, Roberto Micheletti, managed to organize a presidential election on November 29 to replace Zelaya.
In the controversial scrutiny, Porfirio Lobo was elected. This election was recognized by the United States, but questioned by Latin American countries, such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted overwhelmingly against Zelaya’s return to power until his term ended on January 27.
Wall Street Rises, U.S. Trade Balance Fuels Optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed higher on Thursday, the US trade balance figures are a faithful witness to the economic revival of both the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones gained 0.67%; and the Nasdaq, 0.33%.
According to the final figures at the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 68, 78 points reaching 10,405.83 points, and the Nasdaq, of technological component, 7.13 points reaching 2,190.06 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 expanded index rose 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1,102.35 points.
We get good news from different sectors of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
But this is anecdotal, he clarified, considering that the market was concentrated "in the half-full glass".
Peter Cardillo, of Avalon Partners, said investors focused mainly on U.S. trade balance figures, "which reflect an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter."
The U.S. trade deficit fell 7.6 percent in October from September to $32.9 billion.
Analysts, on the contrary, expected a deepening of the deficit.
Both imports and exports increased.
The big news is the growth in trade volumes, particularly exports of goods, which reflect the growth of major economies trading with the United States, said Christopher Cornell of research firm Economy.com.
In contrast, last week, unemployment registrations in the United States unexpectedly increased, 474,000 applications were filed.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers "was the lowest it's been in a year," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond rose to 3.482% from 3.423% on Tuesday night, and that of the 30-year bond to 4.492% from 4.408% the day before.
Cuba: more than a hundred supporters of power boo the "Ladies in White"
On Thursday hundreds of supporters of Cuban power booed the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for World Human Rights Day and prevented another demonstration to which a dozen dissidents were summoned.
Some 40 “Ladies in White,” wives or relatives of political prisoners, were assaulted on the street by supporters of Raul Castro’s government as they walked toward the center of the capital demanding the release of the detainees, an AFP journalist said.
Let the Yankees die!, "Mercenaries!", "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Long live Fidel and Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l!" chanted with their fists the militants of power to the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by plainclothes agents who came to "protect" them.
The day before, a similar demonstration was unleashed against the "Ladies in White" in Havana, without injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana neighborhood of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also preparing to demonstrate on Thursday for the international human rights day, were arrested by plainclothes police officers, an AFP journalist reported.
The agents forcibly loaded the vehicles into dissidents who were booed by government supporters, according to the journalist.
In general, the arrest of dissidents in similar circumstances lasts only a few hours.
The "Ladies in White", awarded the 2005 Sakharov Prize by the European Parliament, had organized an unauthorized march to "solicit the release of all political prisoners", about 200 according to the dissent, said one of its leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband, Hector Maceda, is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Maceda is part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents imprisoned in March 2003, of whom 53 remain behind bars.
The Cuban authorities call the opponents "mercenaries" or "agents" paid by their declared enemy, the United States.
A rare occurrence in the media, Cuban television reported on Thursday’s demonstration by government militants against the “counterrevolutionaries.”
Cuba, ruled by a single party, the Communist Party, is constantly accused by European or American NGOs of trampling on rights and freedoms, especially those of expression.
An alien kills an octogenarian with a knife and leaves 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
An unbalanced man with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and wounded five others in the city center of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hautes-de-Seine) on Thursday at the time of the largest influx of the afternoon
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old assailant allegedly struck an elderly man at or in front of the pharmacy at No. 85 Jean-Jaur<0xC3><0xA8>s Boulevard, police sources and witnesses said.
In the wake of the serious injuries, the man born in 1929 died in hospital, according to an official with the Alliance police union.
Then in the pharmacy or in front of it, he attacked a pregnant woman who was with her partner.
The husband, about thirty years old, interposed and was wounded.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were taken to the hospital where the old man died.
The life of the other wounded, with the vital organs apparently affected, is in danger.
The pregnant woman then fainted and was hospitalized "in shock," a police source said.
The gunman, who appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, had escaped down Boulevard Jean Jaur<0xC3><0xA8>s.
Apparently at random, he would have injured two more pedestrians: a man of thirty, and another of forty seriously.
At night, the crime scene was still unclear.
He was armed with two butcher’s knives that he carried crossed on his back, said Arnaud Pressé, an Alliance union official on the Seine.
Several bystanders, including young people, tried to control the alien, according to testimonies obtained by AFP.
I saw a guy in his thirties in a green jacket.
Three young men tried to intercept him.
They couldn’t because the guy was strong, explained Alberto, a waiter at a nearby bar.
A crowd rushed at him, including a police officer who broke his wrist, he added.
On Boulevard Jean-Jaur<0xC3><0xA8>s, at No. 61, two municipal agents, including the chief, tried to arrest the gunman and were stabbed, according to police testimony.
The events occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where numerous shops are located.
Some people came to tell me that there was a wounded man in the street.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old man on the floor, and when I put him in a safe position, I noticed a very important wound in his abdomen, Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, told AFP.
Five minutes later, a second person, about 35 years old, arrived with knife wounds.
Police officers arrested the man without identity documents.
The Office of the Prosecutor of Nanterre submitted the investigation to the jurisdiction of the Departmental Service of the Judicial Police of Altos del Sena (SDPJ 92).
The man was hospitalized Thursday night.
During his detention, he did not say a word.
A police source does not rule out the possibility of admitting him to a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, it took six policemen to overpower him at the Clichy police station where he was transferred.
He was "in a state of overexcitement" as "any such deranged person whose forces increase considerably under the effect of action."
U.S.: Polanski's lawyer again calls for the cause to be dismissed
French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski’s lawyer again called Thursday in Los Angeles (California, Western United States), to dismiss the case against his client, who is under house arrest in Switzerland, for a case of sexual abuse that occurred more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, an attorney for the director of "The Pianist," reported before three judges of the Second District Court of Appeals of California serious procedural errors at the time of the events, in 1977.
Hummel stated: I claim that the charges are dismissed at this very moment, as the conduct of the judge in charge of the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, "was chilling."
According to him, Judge Rittenband (who has since died) had a conversation with a prosecutor who told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison before passing sentence, which constitutes a serious lack of procedure.
This conversation was made public in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired", from the very mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But finally Wells declared at the end of September "having lied" to the author of the documentary.
Hummel called for a trial that would allow him to present evidence of his case if the court rejects the dismissal of the case.
The prosecution, for its part, reiterated the argument put forward in the first instance, namely that no dismissal of the charges could be seriously assessed until Roman Polanski appeared before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978 before his sentence was handed down for “illegal sexual relations” with a 13-year-old girl.
Since then, he has never set foot in the United States again.
Los Angeles Deputy District Attorney Phyllis Asayama said Roman Polanski "has to be here to appear at the hearing."
With this case, we want to convey the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, that there is a possibility of fleeing?
For her, the filmmaker "asks a favor to the court, although he despises its authority."
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to deliver his sentence, also stressed "that there were other alternatives to the decision to flee."
Hummel was not the only one asking to dismiss the case against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer’s lawyer, the victim, also called, once again, to close the case.
She argues that her client can no longer stand being harassed every time the Polanski case resurfaces, adding: “No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough.”
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland on a U.S. arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was sentenced to house arrest in his Gstaad hut, awaiting possible extradition.
Wall Street loses direction and slows down due to the rise of the dollar
The New York Stock Exchange closed on Friday aimlessly, in a market that is struggling between better than expected indicators in the United States and the rise of the dollar: the Dow Jones gained 0.63%, but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final figures at the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while the Nasdaq, of technological component, lost 0.55 points to stand at 2,190.31 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 expanded index advanced 0.37% (4.06 points), reaching 1,106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains with narrow margins, the volume of trade is increasingly reduced and I think it will remain that way until the end of the year.
The trend was sustained by the release of better-than-expected economic indicators, which “helped improve market sentiment on the strength of the economic recovery,” analysts at Charles Schwab summarized.
In the United States, retail sales rose 1.3% in November for the second consecutive month and higher than expected.
In addition, U.S. consumer confidence visibly recovered in December, up 73.4 from 67.4 the previous month, according to the University of Michigan’s preliminary index estimate.
However, the indexes were slowed by a new advance of the dollar that reached the highest level of the last two months against the euro, which "leads down to sectors sensitive to the economic situation," explained Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
In this way, technological values lost ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond rose 3.540% to 3.482% on Wednesday night, and that of the 30-year bond to 4.497% to 4.492% the day before.
The election of Miss World again in South Africa
After a month of touring South Africa, the 112 candidates for the title of Miss World are on the final stretch to fulfill their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion spectators.
During this great celebration of beauty organized for the second consecutive year in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already achieved their participation in the semifinal.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gibraltar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were elected Miss Sportswoman or even Miss Top Model during their stay in Africa.
It was a real uproar.
It was extraordinary to visit beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town.
“I saw so many things and lived countless experiences!” said Miss Sierra Leone in astonishment.
The event, which is being held for the ninth time in South Africa, will be broadcast live on Saturday from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, starting at 5 p.m.
Impossible to imagine a better country to surrender my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
“I’m very happy to have lived twice,” says Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with the candidates and the possibility of rediscovering "African landscapes that take your breath away".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, press conferences and safaris, the candidates for Miss World concentrate on the contest.
India’s Pooja Chopra hopes to be able to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, winner in 2000 and present in this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both of whom have become Bollywood stars.
Every woman’s dream is to be crowned the most beautiful woman in the world, but it’s not just about appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries, and I want to return to my country with the crown, declares Miss India with a big smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will mark this 59th edition.
The candidates will parade in traditional dresses and, of course, with a swimsuit.
Chinese presenter Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean, and Miss World committee official Steve Douglas will host the event.
South Africa proved to be able to welcome the world with warmth and pride that are difficult to match, says Julia Morley, president of the Miss World pageant.
Like last year, the candidates went on a safari, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time by bike, and tasted the local cuisine.
As an exceptional event, they met the South African president, Jacob Zuma, who shook their hand.
This is unusual for a head of state, notes Miss Sierra Leone.
His best memory will undoubtedly be the draw in Cape Town (Southwest) for the World Cup in June 2010, a way for the country to further promote the event.
I dealt with people I never thought I'd get to know.
Probably back for the 2010 World Cup, says excited Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
The news about Johnny Hallyday "is very positive", according to his son David
The news about Johnny Hallyday "is very positive," his son David said Friday when he arrived at the Los Angeles airport to accompany his father hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
Dad is strong and everything is going very well, David Hallyday told the press when he got off the plane that was bringing him from Paris shortly after 1 p.m. local time (9 p.m. GMT).
The son of the singer, relaxed, said he would move "as soon as possible" to the Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday entered on Monday due to an infection derived from the herniated disc operation on November 26 in Paris.
The musician is "in an induced coma since that night in Los Angeles for reasons of comfort, to avoid suffering and thus be able to administer his treatment," the press service said.
Johnny Hallyday had already been subjected to a coma induced by doctors at Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> hospital in Los Angeles, where he entered Monday due to an infection, the result of a herniated disc operation on November 26 in Paris.
The singer was operated once again on Wednesday night to Thursday because of serious injuries caused by the previous intervention.
His wife Laeticia went Friday morning to the French high school in Los Angeles, attended by her daughter Jade, to witness a school event, confirmed an AFP photographer.
The head of Orthopedic Surgery and Traumatology at the Pitié-Salp<0xC3><0xAA>tri<0xC3><0xA8>re hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would travel to Los Angeles on Monday to be with the singer.
The producer violently accused Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated on the singer on November 26 at the international private clinic of the Parc Monceau, in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were outraged, Camus said.
There is talk of a possible lawsuit, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus claimed that Johnny Hallyday had "traveled too fast to Los Angeles with the authorization of the Parisian surgeon".
I spoke directly to the doctor and was surprised when he assured me that there was no problem in making the trip, as I was operated twice on herniated disc, he added.
Shortly before on the RTL radio station, he indicated that the singer had apparently "gone without cannula, without anything", after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic environment.
He operated on actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before her death, at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where Delajoux was working at the time.
In 2007, he also intervened with actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to reabsorb a hematoma formed as a result of a cerebral hemorrhage.
He is a doctor with a bad reputation, condemned by the courts on several occasions for malpractice, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, a lawyer for the Order of Physicians, accused him of being "an unscrupulous man" sued "regularly" before the Council of the Order, and is "far from recommended".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
He indicated that the intervention "was carried out without any inconvenience" and that the results of the postoperative studies were "normal".
The operation "could not cause bleeding and therefore did not need drainage," he added.
Anyway, the tour of the singer, whose health problems multiply since the summer, went into a parenthesis.
Without a doubt, resuming the tour on January 8 (in Amiens) as planned, it seems very risky, said Camus.
The UDF association raises the tone and warns the New Center about the use of its acronym
The association UDF (Union for French Democracy), controlled by the MoDem (Democratic Movement) of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou, reacted on Friday to the attempt of the president of the New Center, Hervé Morin, to launch an OPA (Public Offer of Acquisition) on the acronym of the former Giscardist party, urging him to remove it from all support, under penalty of being sued.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the UDF acronym, as he considers that Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou was not in a position to defend his political heritage after having extended his hand to the left.
On the other hand, the Minister of Defense, whose party is associated with the UMP, had planned to confirm the strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
As support for his management, he received the help of the deputy Hervé de Charette (former UMP, current NC) who claims ownership of the UDF brand, as he was the first to register it at the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2004.
But on Friday night, the office of the UDF association, controlled by friends of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou who do not want to be deprived of it, broke the silence to issue a request to the Minister and the deputy urging them to renounce the acronym and transfer the property rights of the brand, under penalty of lawsuit.
In recent days, you have made many statements insinuating that you were going to propose to your political movement to recover the acronym UDF, writes the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez of the MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Athuis of the Centrist Alliance.
They also believe it is right to continue the use of the movement’s name, the +Nouveau centre+, and the slogan +l’UDF d’aujourd’hui+ in their militant material and on the presentation page of their site, the letter’s signatories maintain.
As you already know, they have no right to use the acronym, explains the UDF office that requires the NC to remove "immediately the mention of the name of the UDF from all media, as well as from (its) Internet site".
It also asks Hervé de Charette "to transfer the ownership of (the) mark to the rightful heirs".
Failure to do so will result in an appeal to the courts to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warn.
In the letter, they state that the UDF "has been a true political movement since 1978" and recall that Morin and his friends "chose" to leave in 2007 "to create a new party, as others had already done in 2002 to create the UMP".
Therefore, the New Center has, according to them, no right to use the acronym UDF.
They also recall that the last congress of the UDF voted in 2007 to adhere to the MoDem for three years and the creation of an office in charge of defending "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "when he registered the trademark", he was no longer "a member of the UDF for three years", but of the UMP.
Scandalously and fraudulently takes advantage of the absence of registration of the UDF acronym to do it on your own.
This indiscretion is becoming a crime, they denounce, before mocking the strategy of the NC: "We believe that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make your own name than to try to get out of anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which you do not have the right."
Liliane Bettencourt case: Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier to be tried for abuse of weakness
On Friday, the Court of Nanterre decided to put the artist Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier on trial to determine whether, as the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt claims, she took advantage of the state of weakness of the octogenarian to plunder a part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his photos of stars of the show, will be tried on April 15 and 16, 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime whose conviction consists of a maximum penalty of three years in prison and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This means that in this case there will be a process worthy of a saga about one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter compete for the reins of the L'Oréal cosmetics empire.
But Correctional Court No. 15 also ordered 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt to undergo a medical examination by three medical professionals.
The heiress and main shareholder of L'Oréal always refused to submit to such examinations, even more so under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Prosecutor's Office during the investigation.
The doctors appointed this Friday must submit a report before March 10, 2010 in which they must state if Liliane Bettencourt suffered states of weakness and during which periods.
I think he'll take it.
"I'll talk to her," said Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman, as he left the hearing.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Bettencourt-Meyers’ lawyer, Olivier Metzner, was pleased with the court’s decision.
It is excellent news (...) The expert report will show that he (Banier) manipulated this elderly lady, whom we must protect, he said.
For the past two years, Liliane Bettencourt’s only daughter has launched criminal proceedings against Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier, a multifaceted photographer and artist, accusing him of having taken advantage of his mother’s weakness for years to obtain one billion euros in donations, through checks, life insurance contracts or works of art.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt has always denied being manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers a long-time friend.
On Friday, as the court examined the provenance of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers’ action, the lawyers’ arguments were, on some occasions, a great family confession.
In this way, Liliane Bettencourt’s lawyer took into account three letters that her client sent (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary in which she said she distrusted Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Bettencourt-Meyers’ husband.
In the 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "I could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once or twice a day for fifteen years.
Since their wedding, I have never been able to speak to Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise again.”
For its part, the Nanterre Public Prosecutor’s Office considered, once again, that the applicant was not in a position to appear, all the more so since a guardianship judge refused, in recent days, to make room for her request to open a judicial guardianship procedure for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to appear before the court, is not under guardianship and has no guardian.
No other person will be able to appear in their place,” said Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney, a public prosecutor.
Finally, the court decided that a judgment on the admissibility of Ms Bettencourt-Meyers would be delivered after the trial.
The Management Revolution or the End of Business Intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our struggle for the development of business intelligence will have been in vain...
More than ten years ago, the attitude of the management of large companies to their employees recalls the position of companies with regard to consumers before the marketing revolution: it is a question of employees adhering to "values" determined from above as before it was a question of imposing on consumers products designed by factory technicians.
By putting the customer at the center of the company, the marketing revolution gave way to strategies of conquering the markets... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products that have no relation to customer preference factors is repeated regularly.
A demobilization of employees can end in a deadly demoralization.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the tip of the iceberg of a much more general phenomenon that particularly affects executives.
This demobilization seriously compromises the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially R & D and, even more, business intelligence.
Indeed, BI (Business Intelligence) "requires all parties involved (...) to have a proactive conduct and a forward-looking vision"; it needs on the part of employees a commitment that completely opposes the recommendations of an authoritarian management.
For this reason, we call for a management revolution, which would consist of putting employees at the center of the concerns of the company as well as the customer.
Internal opinion polls are relatively useful
Will internal opinion polls, such as Orange’s questionnaire among its employees, incite managerial revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
-In principle, because I was able to verify that, in the face of a new situation, and after many turns, all companies end up doing essentially... what they always did!
Second, because authoritarianism, one of the pathologies of power, grows in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
-Finally, because most managers have a simplistic view of human behavior.
As they come from the great schools of engineers, they interpret psychology in a mechanistic way.
They adopt, for intellectual comfort, the old behaviorist theory that American “neurosciences” recently revived, and that the Institutes of Studies and the media widely spread behind their backs.
In this way, by suggesting that it is possible to manage the “commands” (sic) of executive engagement, a recent Ipsos research published in Le Figaro.fr reaffirms the managers in a mechanistic management posture, unadapted to today’s world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern companies involves adopting a finalist vision of human behavior.
It consists in integrating into any reasoning or business management practice, a fundamental fact: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it clearly appears as a means to make part of their dreams, ambitions and projects a reality.
Today, only studies from the Motifunctional Analysis adopt this conception of employee motivations.
The studies showed that they judge their company based on a predetermined doxa that allows them, through the image they have of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their own life projects.
Through the identification and measurement of mobilization factors, company managers can monitor, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and relocate human resource management "in place".
In this way, they create a favorable terrain for the organized development of a strong and effective business intelligence.
Oslo speech: Obama receives praise from the right for ‘just war’
On Friday, the American right, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize has defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States, hailed the speech that Obama had delivered on Thursday.
The conservatives, who had discredited the award to Obama on October 9, this time applauded the presidential speech, as did Sarah Palin, a former vice presidential candidate during the 2008 election.
I loved what she said, Mrs. Palin, a leading figure in the right wing of the Republican Party, told USA Today, adding that she herself had addressed the issue of war “sometimes necessary” in her recently published memoirs.
In my opinion, war is, of course, the last thing the Americans want to be forced to do, but it is necessary.
Terrorists must be stopped, he said.
Obama, who inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, dedicated, on Thursday in Oslo, to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done "a very good job" in Oslo.
I think that the speech was really very good, the former speaker of the House of Representatives rejoiced, who appreciated in particular the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential words.
At times, the speech seemed very historic, Gingrich said, during an interview on the radio show "The Takeaway."
The former elected representative, who some consider a possible candidate for the Republican inauguration for the 2012 presidential election, was pleased to hear from “a leftist president” when he reminded members of the Nobel Committee “that they would not be free and could not deliver a peace prize if the resort to force did not exist.”
According to Michael Gerson, author of George W. Bush’s speeches and current Washington Post columnist, Obama delivered “a very American speech.”
In addition to presenting himself as a “citizen of the world,” as “always does,” he “spoke like an American president” by reminding Europeans “that they live in a security bubble that they didn’t create and that they don’t do much to preserve it,” Gerson said.
Among the few unconvinced right-wingers, a Bush-era hawk, former U.N. ambassador John Bolton called the speech “monotonous, pretentious and uninspired” on the National Review Online website.
To the president’s left, Democratic Rep. Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
When we cover the war with the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the slaughter of innocents, he warned.
However, the center-left press praised the president.
Los Angeles Time, while still believing Obama received the Nobel Prize prematurely, called his speech "overproduction" especially for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo speech "should serve as a road map to guide international decisions in the fight against conflict, poverty and oppression," the California newspaper said excitedly.
Obama "pronounced the speech that was needed," the New York Times said, calling it "both bleak and uplifting."
Road transport: three marathon negotiations to guarantee Christmas supply
After three sessions of marathon negotiations, the road sector unions and the TLF (Transport and Logistics of France), the only employer organization that remained until the end, reached an agreement on Friday afternoon that ends the slogan of strike and the threat that falls on the Christmas supply.
During Friday night's signing session, Secretary of State for Transport Dominique Bussereau "rejoiced" in the deal, following several negotiating sessions that began Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, negotiators said goodbye at dawn on Friday in the hope of quickly signing the agreement text late in the morning.
Even when three employers’ organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) pulled out with a bang.
But a meeting of more than six hours that began at 11 a.m. was necessary for everyone to agree and the text is signed at 6 p.m.
The conflict "would have been very damaging to businesses" and "was feared to disrupt the holiday season," Bussereau said.
The text foresees an increase of 4% for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport), and of 2.9% for the highest (international transport).
The hourly rate rises from 8.72 euros to 9.06 for low-wage workers.
It’s not much, but we started with a lot of disadvantage, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
If so, we will give the order to our militants that there will be no more cuts or blockades in the supply centers.
But there can always be some dissenting rebel, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, acknowledged that this is "a good deal", although it was "difficult to grant increases to high wages taking into account international competition".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros per month for low salaries and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is a common-sense agreement that respects employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) recognized it as "a historic agreement".
For Richard Jaubert (CGT) it is "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for an increase in travel expenses of 3 per cent and the holding of general assemblies for road transport in the first half of 2010, which will make it possible above all to address the issue of an extraordinary payment and a modernisation of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled that "a loss of 100 million euros in employers' burdens" was the subject of a government amendment in the finance rectification bill for 2009, which the National Assembly voted on Thursday night.
The government will ask the Senate to vote on it “on the same terms.”
The signing of TLF allows the agreement to apply, firstly, to the companies affiliated to this organization and, secondly, to the entire profession, in case the Minister of Labor makes an extension.
It will be done “as soon as possible,” Bussereau said.
Opposition from employers’ organisations could only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced that it was a "na<0xC3><0xAF>ve business", since the 100 million euros "had already been promised to the sector to offset part of the CO2 tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate in an emergency situation, not as a conclusion to an analysis discussed by the parties, but not to contradict those who want to eat turkey at the next Christmas Eve dinner, lamented Unostra.
For the OTHER, the agreement puts at risk "the stability of many SMEs in the sector during the next 12 months".
RER A: conflicts over the weekend, unions disagree with RATP proposals
Conflicts on the RER A, France’s largest urban public transport line, are set to continue over the weekend, because at Friday’s meeting, the 2nd day of a strike between unions and the RATP leadership, there was no agreement and the unions were unsatisfied with their premium order.
For this important Christmas shopping weekend, on Saturday and Sunday only trains will run between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m., at the rate of one train out of two on the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and one train out of four on the other lines.
Interconnection with the SNFC will be suspended at Nanterre Prefecture, forcing passengers to change trains.
The Galeries Lafayette, which expects 200,000 customers every day, was pleased that “RATP strives to provide service to department stores.”
The RER A crosses the city of Paris from west to east.
The RATP section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains ran at peak times, and almost no trains at off-peak times, as had been expected.
On Thursday there was no disorder on the platforms thanks to the organization of the inhabitants of the <0xC3><0x8E>le-de-France.
In this way, at dawn, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less crowded than normal, especially due to the absence of students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer, explained that he had woken up "an hour and a half earlier to get to the schedule".
The Saint-Lazare station was not saturated, said the SNCF, which had provided for the supervision of police and law enforcement.
The RER A operated by the SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from Saint-Lazare station to join the metros.
New general assemblies of striking workers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, and the "unsatisfactory" results of a meeting held with management on Friday afternoon will be analyzed, according to the unions.
The director of the RERs proposes to negotiate a specific protocol in all aspects for the RER A: working time, professional development, etc.
That is not what drivers who claim a premium that is owed to them want, according to Thierry Garon (South).
RATP even puts its premium proposals in parentheses, the CGT said indignantly, noting that the management "was not able to solve a problem that SNCF and the road sector had already solved."
A new meeting is planned on Monday to carry out "a more extensive analysis on the conditions of exercise of the profession," said the RATP.
This also led the unions to say that the company “didn’t care about the weekend users.”
In the morning, about 150 drivers invaded a committee at the headquarters in Paris.
Then the leadership, which until then refused to dialogue during the strike, suggested the meeting "to calm the waters".
The conflict could spread to RER B on Tuesday, after Unsa and the Indépendants filed a notice.
The unions ask for a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants) and complain about the degradation of working conditions in this line that has one million daily passengers.
RER drivers, all in the second grade of their professional career, charge from 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross and from 600 to 650 euros of premiums, for schedules with alternating shifts, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves pro-Kurdish party, a decision with serious consequences
Turkey’s Constitutional Court ruled Friday in favor of the dissolution of the country’s main pro-Kurdish party, a decision that immediately sparked angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community, in the country’s southeast and in Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the task of the government, which has just extended a hand to the Kurdish community trying to put an end to 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) was dissolved because it had become the “focus of activities that harmed the independence of the state and its indivisible unity,” Court President Hasim Kili<0xC3><0xA7> told reporters after four days of deliberations.
The decision of the 11 judges was unanimous, although only a majority of seven votes was needed to obtain the dissolution, Kili<0xC3><0xA7> said, adding that 37 of the party's leaders, including its president Ahmet T<0xC3><0xBC>rk and deputy Aysel Tugluk, are removed from political life for five years.
The judge also announced the cessation of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by T<0xC3><0xBC>rk and Tugluk, and the confiscation of party property by the Treasury.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
Its leaders warned ahead of the verdict that MPs would leave parliament before becoming non-partisan MPs.
The decision follows a procedure launched by Supreme Court prosecutor Abdurrahman Yal<0xC3><0xA7>inkaya in 2007 that accuses the DTP of obeying the “principles” of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many other countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase for the PKK rebels.
However, the party claims that it has no "organic links" with the PKK, but refuses to qualify it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The court’s verdict comes as the government extends a hand to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen their rights, so that the Kurds stop supporting the PKK and thus end the conflict.
DTP leaders said a dissolution could lead to an escalation of tensions in southeastern Anatolia, where a large number of demonstrations against the conditions of detention of PKK leader Abdullah <0xC3><0x96>calan have escalated into clashes with police in recent weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, thousands of demonstrators have gathered in front of DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the large southeastern city mostly populated by Kurds.
Law enforcement threw tear gas grenades and used water cannons, while protesters threw Molotov cocktails or stones with slingshots.
In Istanbul, about 100 people were also concentrated.
After the verdict, T<0xC3><0xBC>rk said the court's decision would "deepen the despondency".
Turkey cannot resolve this issue by dissolving a party, he told the press.
The government, made up of a party from the Islamist movement, also regrets the decision.
In principle, we oppose the closure of parties.
So nothing is solved, declared the Minister of Energy, Taner Yildiz.
This decision completely boycotts the democratic opening launched by the government, said political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can expect, of course, a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for an attack that killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the bloodiest attacks in recent months.
Snow can start suddenly.
A truly cool winter is what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
It’s not something you want to make life impossible for citizens, says the EDF’s director of winter road maintenance
But with this your employees can learn to test and master the whole vehicle technology.
Meteorologists may announce it for the first time this weekend.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
In this case, the EDF acts in accordance with a detailed plan.
As soon as it snows profusely in Frankfurt and temperatures drop below zero degrees, 20 of the so-called A-slots come out with large vehicles with salt, explains Brauburger.
These include, for example, major arteries and avenues such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
But also the accesses for the fire department, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and sections with slopes, such as the Atzelbergstra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
FES service starts around three in the morning
Approximately 1,040 kilometers should be covered, as needed, in a maximum of three hours with wet salt, which adheres better.
That is why the FES begins around three in the morning, "with this the roads are free until the rush hour traffic begins".
The hardest part is when it starts to snow around 7:30.
“Then we have a problem,” says the director of road maintenance in winter, “because then no one is ready to clear space to vehicles with salt.”
Immediately afterwards, when it is no longer snowing, it falls on the secondary and private roads, to which the Rat-Beil-Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e also belongs.
The last priority is the side and secondary streets.
That’s where the hassle comes in, Brauburger knows all too well.
Around five in the morning the FES infantry are launched, mainly clearing dangerous spots and cruisers.
In general, the FES would not be able to take charge of all bicycle lanes.
In Frankfurt there is a special service, which from 22 to 4:30 does not lose sight mainly of the bridges, comments Brauburger.
As these quickly become slippery, the vehicle with salt is started as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees.
In case of emergency, the police can also call them.
The cradle of the dinosaur
The Tawa hablae looked the same as many other carnivorous dinosaurs: a two-meter-long, five-foot-tall animal that ran on two strong hind legs, had an elongated head with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with sickle-shaped claws, and a long tail.
If the species had lived a couple of million years later, this wouldn’t have been anything special.
But Tawa trollae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body features, reports Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues in Thursday's journal Science.
The species lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which at the time was in a dry area of the supercontinent Pangaea at the equator.
Tawa opened a new window into the early evolution of dinosaurs, Nesbitt says.
It shows us a lot about the genealogical relationships, spread, and characteristics of early dinosaurs.
Nesbitt and other paleontologists began an excavation at Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico in 2006.
Sometimes, we’ve found a dozen dinosaur bones in a day — this is unprecedented for Triassic sediments, reports Randall Irmis, a team member at the Utah Museum of Natural History.
The researchers quickly identified some bones as belonging to a new species.
In the course of the excavation they gathered in total the remains of five specimens.
A find confirms theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs
The name "Tawa" comes from the Hopi Indian sun god.
For Sterling Nesbitt it is an exceptional finding: “Triassic dinosaur fossils are extremely rare, usually only individual fragments are found.”
Other dinosaur experts don’t share such enthusiasm at all.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to current opinion, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
But many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, so the classification of these early dinosaurs is quite controversial.
Thus, experts debate, for example, when the saurians split into their three most important genealogical lineages: the carnivorous theropods among which are the Tyrannosaurus Rex, the Velociraptor and also the birds, the quadrupedal sauropods known as "long-necked" and their relatives, and the Stenithischia herbivores.
According to the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa trollae is a primitive theropod.
It shows an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, Nesbitt says.
For example, in Tawa’s skull, the researchers found evidence of air pockets, such as those also possessed by theropod descendants, birds.
Thanks to air pockets, birds’ breathing is more efficient than that of mammals.
In the case of Tawa trovae also the bones of the spine were evidently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with air pockets, says Randall Irmis.
Because the related line of later giant sauropods also possessed air pockets and light bones, it was likely that the common ancestors of both groups already produced this useful innovation.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs so far known lived in South America, researchers deduce that saurians first emerged there.
Consequently, the three genealogical lineages separated at first and spread from South America to all corners of the Earth, which at that time still formed a single landmass, the supercontinent Pangaea.
However, the facts say that the team found along with Tawae the remains of two other theropods not closely related.
The three cannot descend from a single related ancestor, the researchers argue.
We think there were at least three waves of migration to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of the Science study.
Of course, there are opponents too.
An even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to a sister group to the dinosaurs, lived in present-day Poland, says Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
Their opinion could give a distorted picture, because simply in South America many dinosaur fossils are still preserved, while on other continents there is hardly anything to discover.
The question of how dinosaurs managed to evolve from a relatively rare collateral line of reptiles to the dominant terrestrial vertebrates of the Mesozoic remains an enigma.
While in the Triassic dinosaurs still shared their living space with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of today's crocodiles and pterosaurs and with many other saurians.
Towards the end of the Triassic the dinosaurs expanded all over the world and many new species developed, while the kinship became extinct at the Triassic boundary towards the Jurassic.
The success stories were not eternal.
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, comments Martin Sander.
A mass extinction may have occurred that the dinosaurs survived by chance, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted, so they were able to beat the opponents in the area.
Success stories are not always eternal.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact halted the rise of a group of species, which had also already evolved in the Triassic and since then led a miserable existence: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the international signatories.
Professors from the University of Toronto, Cambridge, Vienna or Berkeley, California, participate.
Teachers from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen participate.
The police eviction of the occupied casino of the Goethe University of Frankfurt had repercussions all over the world.
278 professors and professors from Goethe University, but also from higher education institutions throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, stand in solidarity with the protesting students at the Westend Campus.
In a statement drafted in German and English, they “reject” the police eviction promoted by the board of directors.
Werner M<0xC3><0xBC>ller-Estler, president of the university, had the building occupied by students and teachers on an educational strike evicted last week, because the walls and works of art were covered with propaganda.
As a result, five students suffered injuries.
The material damages, the signatories judge, do not justify "the violent dissolution of the courses organized by the students and professors themselves by a police commando."
The eviction represented an “unacceptable attack” on freedom of research and learning.
The exclusive focus on vandalism served to “delegitimize and criminalize the protest” and diverted attention from the content.
The Governing Council has refused to enter into the necessary negotiations.
The teachers demand the immediate withdrawal of the judicial claim.
Most of the occupants have not caused any material damage, it is said.
Legitimized protest
The young people of the Verdi trade union and the German Trade Union Federation also stand in solidarity with the students.
The protest is the legitimate expression of a growing concern for one’s own future, comments Verdi’s national youth secretary Alexander Klein.
Eva K<0xC3><0xBC>hne-H<0xC3><0xB6>rmann (CDU), Minister of Science of Hessen defended, however, the action of the rector of the university and the police.
We are grateful to the rector of the university.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, he said in a broadcast of Aktuelle Stunde on Thursday in the parliament of the province of Wiesbaden.
“We are sympathetic to the protest, but we are not sympathetic to the vandalism,” said Peter Beuth, a delegate from the provincial parliament for the CDU.
The opinion of the opposition factions, the SPD, the Greens and the left, is different.
The CDU used the painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, Janine Wissler (Left) said.
Instead of thoroughly studying the arguments and demands of the students, they are evicted.
The Left has introduced a motion, in which the Minister of the Interior is requested to submit a report on police intervention.
New Silicon Valley
For many years, it was regarded as a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of Moscow’s ten districts, was in the Soviet Union a heavily guarded site for secret weapons research.
Today, the community of 216,000 inhabitants, located 37 kilometers from the center of Moscow, is considered the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Important research and production centers of micro and nanoelectronics are located here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd have been in contact with the scientific headquarters of Riedberg in Frankfurt, university institutes and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Center (FIZ).
Several mutual visits were made and now, on Wednesday, Selenogrado and Riedberg sign in Frankfurt a "Protocol of close collaboration".
Moscow Deputy Mayor Juri Rosljak and Selengrad Mayor Anatoly Smirnov led the Russian delegation, with planning services chief Edwin Schwarz signing for Frankfurt.
In 2010 representatives of the FIZ and directors of small and medium-sized enterprises of the natural sciences research centre will travel to a seminar in Selenograd.
Scientific exchange
This is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it also addresses trade relations.
FIZ companies will have the possibility to set foot in the growing Russian market.
In return, Russian scientific companies want to have access to contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is home to major Russian companies and research institutes.
Among them are, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the large Sitronics consortia and Rossijskaja Elektronika.
The community was founded in 1958 as the so-called "Socialist Planning City" for weapons research.
Selenograd (literally translated as "Green City") received its name from the landscape of forested mountains, on which research facilities were settled.
Stuttgart brakes
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 is not at all high enough.
For supporters of the project it is simply and plainly "the new heart of Europe".
The law so. S21 is much more than the reduction of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project, which will precipitate to the capital of the region of Banden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg a decade of chaos of irremediable construction sites.
Stuttgart 21 emerged from the spirit of the 1980s.
Rail terminals, which end in the middle of the city, were considered at the time engineering fossils of the nineteenth century, which acted as brakes on modern rail traffic, since formerly an enormous amount of time was needed to engage the locomotives from back to front.
To roll, to stop dry, to continue the journey; but so it must be done.
And that’s why the terminals had to disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a transit station, which is located approximately halfway between the trans-European lines of operation between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava; hence the slogan "Heart of Europe".
S21 will indeed be initiated, even though the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious designers have known that in the Hessian and Bavarian capitals it is almost priceless to implement the reduction.
The railway terminals of course do not have more problems of entry and exit, since there are reversible locomotives with tractor unit and driver's carriage at both ends.
However: Stuttgart 21 including the new ICE-built stretch towards Ulm will already be started.
Federal and communal politicians have arranged it so.
The railway continues, also because the risks of the Republic’s large individual infrastructure projects are borne by the taxpayer and not by the State.
From an urban point of view, the project is still justified to a certain extent.
New urban space is created, provided with many green areas, probably of the computer generated graphics of the designer.
For the rail transport system the S21 is harmful.
The crossing station and the road support are designed for the transport of people, which was attributed to the enormous growth typical of the 1980s.
At that time there was no competition for low-cost flights.
But modern transport policy must first deal with strengthening freight transport, as rail transport is considerably more environmentally friendly than road haulage.
However, the new sections under construction are good for freight trains due to the intense gradients.
Even more serious is that the S21 also indirectly affects many other railway projects.
More than six billion euros must be buried in the Zuavos.
That's the official figure.
Experts believe that it is more realistic between ten and fifteen billion.
It is certain that in the next decade the money will be lacking in other crossings and narrow passages in the network.
A total of sixty major projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the extension of more than 180 kilometers of long rails through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987 the route has been built at a slow pace.
It would be urgent here to step on the accelerator properly.
However, the S21 acts as a brake.
The stretch of the Rhine Valley will be the bottleneck for international freight transport: through the heart of Europe.
The government is examining the judgment on the airport.
The federal government is leaving the regional parliament in Wiesbaden pending an appeal to the Hesse administrative court’s ruling on the ban on night flights.
The CDU/FDP coalition appears to have commissioned experts to investigate the VGH ruling, which is more than 400 pages long, according to Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP).
The administrative court in Kassel had argued in writing on that date that in the case of the planned north-west runway at Frankfurt airport, the federal state would have to re-regulate the night flight ban.
The admission of 17 flights between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m., as envisaged by the federal government, would not be reconcilable with the mandatory legal protection of the population from noise due to air traffic.
The coalition has until January 4 to decide whether to file an appeal against this ruling.
The opposition criticized this postponement and pressured government representatives to waive the appeal to the nation’s Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD group, Torsten Sch<0xC3><0xA4>fer-G<0xC3><0xBC>mbel, urged the CDU and the FDP to respect their promises to ban nighttime air traffic, which they had made before the elections; otherwise this could be taken as a lack of words.
It is quite difficult, if one is allowed to keep his word, said Greens chief Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the FDP slogan "We keep our word."
Minister Posch rejected Sch<0xC3><0xA4>fer-G<0xC3><0xBC>mbel's recrimination, that the federative government would be trying by misrepresentations of law and tricks yet still get their night flights.
A thorough legal investigation would take quite some time.
The coalition would not want to act on the basis of a “quick first impression”.
We need a legally unimpeachable decision, said Stefan M<0xC3><0xBC>ller (FDP).
As represented by the opposition, it would never have been the assertions of his group about the night air traffic ban.
U.S. banks repay the loans.
The big U.S. banks shaken by the crisis are stripping themselves of their state bonds.
The "Bank of America" returned in one go the aid that had been provided by the bank rescue fund Tarp of a total of 45 billion (approximately 30 billion euros).
And also the Citi group plans to return state aid, according to a CNBC report from the United States.
With this the institutes intend to free themselves from the restrictions that had gone hand in hand with the acceptance of money, such as the limitation on the payment of bonuses to directors, as well as the payment of high rates.
The Bank of America had raised approximately $19 billion in cash through convertible bonds.
The rest of the sum was taken from the box itself, which had enough means, among others by the sale of items.
Banking director Kenneth Lewis thanked U.S. taxpayers in particular on Wednesday night: the financial injection helped overcome very difficult times.
The banking house had miscalculated the investment bank absorption effort at the climax of the financial crisis.
The Citi group also aims to raise money on the capital market in order to free itself from its obligations to the state.
CNBC reported from well-known circles that the US bank could announce as early as Thursday the increase of its capital of 20 billion dollars.
A representative of the Citi group declined to comment.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already returned their aid.
Quick Choice
In the end, everything went faster than I thought.
Just two weeks after the board of directors of the ZDF (German TV channel) pressured editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender to leave his post, the channel may present a successor.
Last night the guild intended to vote on the candidate.
The favourite was Peter Frey, head of the ZDF’s main studio in Berlin.
There was no confirmation of this by the station, officially not to anticipate the procedure.
But surely it also influenced not to further harm the director of the ZDF Markus Sch<0xC3><0xA4>chter, if this proposal would also not be approved in the administrative council.
Frey, Sch<0xC3><0xA4>chter’s candidate, needs the support of nine of the guild’s 14 members.
The result of the vote was not yet finalized at the close of this edition.
Two weeks ago Sch<0xC3><0xA4>chter failed on the board of directors with his proposal to renew for another five years the contract of Nikolaus Brender.
Only seven members supported Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's dismissal was a bitter failure for Sch<0xC3><0xA4>chter, but a failure one could expect.
Because the majority of the Union in the administrative council already weeks before the election had indicated, that they would not support Brender in his post.
The opposition against the editor-in-chief had been organized by the president of the Hesse government, Mr. Roland Koch.
He declined another term from the prestigious editor-in-chief with the argument, that under Brender’s direction the ZDF news would have lost ratings.
Until shortly before the elections there were protests due to this, in which the political influence on the ZDF was flogged.
In the end, 35 public-law specialists had even meddled in the debate, calling Koch’s move unconstitutional.
But it didn't help.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and Romanesque philology.
He then worked for the radio station "S<0xC3><0xBC>dwestfunk" and the newspaper "Frankfurter Rundschau".
In 1983 it was changed to the ZDF, initially to the informative "heute-journal".
Next stations: 1988 to 1990 personal speaker of the editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 director and conductor of the morning program "Morgenmagazins"; until 2001 director of foreign policy of the ZDF; since then director of the ZDF study in the capital.
The political party of the Greens announced a constitutional demand after the dismissal of Brender, who was elected this Wednesday as journalist of the year by the media magazine "Medium Magazin".
Koch’s opponent on the administrative board, the chairman of the Rhineland-Palatinate government, explained last week that the federated states should change the state agreement of the ZDF in such a way that the director’s staff proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
A withdrawal of political supporters of the ZDF control guilds was ruled out by Beck.
Brender's likely successor, Mr. Peter Frey, recommended himself to the board with a clever move: he strongly criticized the guild for Brender's dismissal.
Thanks to this test of journalistic independence, Sch<0xC3><0xA4>chter was able to appoint him to the post of editor-in-chief without losing face, as the administrative council was able to vote for him, without falling under the suspicion of giving the post to a partisan henchman.
In the calculations of the parties Frey is allotted anyway to the left liberals.
College Careers are Cleared
Partial success for the students: after a year of strikes related to education, the Ministers of Education and Culture of the federated states finally relented. At a meeting of the Ministers of Education and Culture with university rectors, both sides agreed to try to improve the conditions of study in the cases of bachelor’s and master’s degrees.
Students in the future should be able to overcome their careers.
For example, they agreed to reduce the burden of exams: basically each module of the course must end with a single exam.
In addition, it is intended to examine the workload of students, and to ensure a "real and justifiable measure".
The policy and the Universities also want to simplify the recognition of examination results between the Universities inside and outside Germany.
The federated states are committed to more flexibly crafting the structural rules together for Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees.
Regulations of the federated states which diverge from this should no longer exist.
Fewer exams
Since the beginning of the student protests in June the Ministers of Education and Culture and the rectors of the universities continuously talk about the improvement of being able to carry out and successfully conclude a career (studyability).
Now for the first time we are talking about a specific content.
The so-called accreditation council agreed to drastically reduce the number of exams: "Each module ends with a single exam," says a 30-page document, which aims to partially regulate the approval of university degrees.
With the "sensitive reduction of the examination burden" it is intended to prevent development in the wrong direction, which would significantly affect the studyability, as explained by the director of the accreditation council, Mr. Reinhold Grimm.
In addition, in the future "studiability" must be the decisive criterion in the configuration.
Modules and contents should be thoroughly examined as to unnecessary restrictions of students in the choice of courses.
the courses.
Students would have "the right to obtain more spaces, which enable and encourage their own initiative."
These rules would be valid for new races, but also in the examination of existing races.
These must be "recredited" again every five years. But this would mean, it would take until 2015 to examine all the races.
Responsible for this would be nationwide 10 accrediting agencies, which are under the supervision of the accrediting council, which is installed by the federated states.
The education and culture ministers urged the federated states in October to influence the agencies in such a way that the number of subjects and exams are not too strict or demanding.
In some L<0xC3><0xA4>nder, universities and technical schools have already agreed with ministries to take such measures.
So far only Rhineland-Palatinate has ensured to provide additional means for the subsequent development of the Bologna process.
With this money, universities must implement student mentoring and counseling programs, as well as strengthen examination and foreign offices.
The federated state and the universities intend to have 10 million euros for these purposes.
In early 2010 the government wants to bring to parliament a novel of the university law.
According to her, a single exam should be sufficient for the completion of a career model.
The course configuration should be made more flexible, in addition to ensuring the recognition of evaluations in other universities and facilitating accessibility to the Master.
Until the end of next year it is intended to examine all the careers about their "studiability".
On Thursday, the government and the opposition again discussed the conditions for studying in the federal state.
Aside from the praise, there was also criticism of the decisions.
In the board of directors at the federal level of the Juso university groups (young socialists) it was demanded, that the configuration of the educational policy should no longer be carried out "behind closed doors" of the ministers and university rectors.
No later than after the education strikes, now the students as main involved should be able to opine as well.
The president of the board of university rectors (HRK), Margret Wintermantel, gave her support to the students: "We need the experience of the students," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education, with whom the HRK deliberated on a joint reform document.
For the education and science union (GEW) the Bonn agreements were not entirely sufficient: the union demands a legal right for every student with the Bachelor’s degree to access a subsequent Master’s degree.
In addition, the L<0xC3><0xA4>nder must ensure that the current generation of Bachelor's students will have enough places for a Master's degree with the best possible study conditions, as reported by a member of the GEW, Mr. Andreas Keller.
The federated states have to hire quite a few more teachers.
But about greater access to the master’s degree, the Education Ministers did not comment.
More than a footnote about Herta M<0xC3><0xBC>ller
"Entering and leaving Germany is practically out of control," says the first line of a poem by the lyricist Werner S<0xC3><0xB6>llner in unbalanced idiomatic fragments, in which he thematizes the experiences of arrival in Germany lived by a dissident, who won his freedom, but lost the environment of his language.
Werner S<0xC3><0xB6>llner, who was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, first worked as a teacher of German and English in Bucharest, and then as a reader in a children's book publisher, before moving to Frankfurt in 1982.
S<0xC3><0xB6>llner was awarded several literature prizes, in 1993 he gave the memorable lectures on poetry in Frankfurt at Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been director of the Hessen literature forum at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He had a lot to talk about last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich about "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the disfigured mirror of his Securitate files"
Visibly insecure and embarrassed, S<0xC3><0xB6>llner read a statement in which he admitted involvement as an IM in the Romanian secret service Securitate in front of fellow German-Romanian writers, among others Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of those present in 1989, S<0xC3><0xB6>llner had received the German Language Prize.
Attempts at recruitment had begun slowly, in early 1971.
“I am therefore someone who did not defend himself sufficiently in the face of the Securitate’s attempts to provoke fear,” S<0xC3><0xB6>llner said.
The lyricist Werner S<0xC3><0xB6>llner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time as the Nobel Prize for Literature was awarded to Herta M<0xC3><0xBC>ller and her unparalleled literary polemic with the mechanisms of dictatorial domination, the literary scene and especially the community of German authors from Romania was shaken by a case that evidenced the abyss and evil of a political system, which is based on control and espionage.
Werner S<0xC3><0xB6>llner is, as far as is known so far, not only an author, but also a victim.
Walter had played a role in his Securitate file, said literary scientist Michael Markel following S<0xC3><0xB6>llner's confession, and stressed Walter's positive influence on him.
He had excused him or defended him on all the hard points for him, Markel said.
“I feel the moral need to make this claim,” he said.
S<0xC3><0xB6>llner’s statement in this form and in front of this audience was unexpected, the confession of a former dissident and his work with the Romanian secret service, however, is not so surprising.
Germany would have been a comfortable haven for Securitate-Spitzel gewesen spies, Herta M<0xC3><0xBC>ller wrote as early as July in the weekly "Zeit" after reading her own 914-page dossier.
Those involved will surely have speculated and in some cases will have known what names were hidden behind the pseudonyms of Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Unlike the review of the Stasi files with a controlled procedure in Germany, the handling of the control files by the Securitate is still rather diffuse.
A systematic clarification has been boycotted and hampered in recent years.
A National Council for the Clarification of Securitate Records (CNSAS), corresponding to the Birthler authority, was formed in 1999, and the delivery of the records has since been rather delayed.
Since 2005, there is a law regulating the administration of the files.
An interview, following the awarding of the Nobel Prize in Literature to Herta M<0xC3><0xBC>ller, proves that the influence of former Securitate members in Romania is still quite large. In this interview a former head of the Securitate of Temesvar spoke disparagingly of the decorated one.
“She has psychosis,” in the end she was only interrogated once.
The infamy of power seemed to show itself without hesitation in the form of freedom of opinion.
Of course, inevitable questions arise with the S<0xC3><0xB6>llner case, as so often when there are silent faults.
The calm reaction of the listeners to S<0xC3><0xB6>llner’s confession suggests that the continuation of this story will be governed more by the desire for knowledge and not so much by the adjudication of guilt and by shame.
For the genesis of the work of Herta M<0xC3><0xBC>ller, who yesterday accepted the Nobel Prize for literature, it is more than a simple footnote.
The Champions League as a garrison to fill the stomach
When the new coach of Stuttgart’s VfB football team, Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag from his team supplier, boarded a Mercedes C-Class taxi a quarter of an hour after midnight, it seemed as if an elegantly dressed foreign service member was leaving a very pleasant Christmas celebration, in which the sporting goods manufacturer had distributed samples.
The man of the bald feature had hired a chauffeur, because he did not yet know the city.
Otherwise, he would have been able to drive the car himself: after all, there was no alcohol at stake, and the 55-year-old man was not drunk with joy either.
It had been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow the work would begin again.
Or I would start for the first time.
In the words of the Swiss, who had been hired just three days earlier: "It is true that we reached the round of 16", namely in the Champions League, thanks to the 3:1 win against Unirea Urziceni, of Romania, "but we cannot be blinded by success: we will have to fight brutally against relegation."
The "much more important task" awaited them the following Sunday, he said.
Then, it will be necessary to repeat in Mainz the success of the "royal classes" in the daily life of the league.
And eliminate the weaknesses, which have been clearly evidenced again, after the quick three goals of Marica (5), Tr<0xC3><0xA4>sch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Sweepstakes
The Champions League round of 16 (one-way matches on 16/17 and 23/24 February/return matches on 9/10 and 16/17 March) will be drawn on 18 December in Nyon.
So the joy remained limited by the fulminating entrance of Babbel’s successor.
Not only in the supposed savior, who in a short time had inspired the bewildered Stuttgart professionals confidence in themselves, willingness to give themselves and taste for the game.
I went with the players and told them that they had to focus on their strengths, I urged them to be more launched, explained the repairman of souls Gross his recipe for success that sounds so simple, but that with the therapist Babbel had no effect anymore.
He displayed a certain magic, Babbel supporter Jens Lehmann agreed, “when in football a new momentum arises, sometimes things happen that you wouldn’t have thought possible.”
And Sami Khedira, who after a break of several weeks due to an injury advanced quickly to become the best local player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the "phenomenon" perceived with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the way of working of the new boss: "He is a man who intervenes thoroughly, and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
And this is what had been missing, evidently, when Babbel was there.
VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed the test, warns sports manager Horst Heldt
But the VfB Stuttgart needs above all constancy.
Like Gross, the players and the manager also refrained from overestimating the win against a defense weakened by lack of relays and totally exceeded by the Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen with the 0:4 had come the sad awakening, Khedira thought.
And manager Horst Heldt warned that while one goal of the season had been achieved, the other was still a long way off.
We have not yet overcome the problem.
That Heldt did not feel like celebrating his 40th birthday, even after the first victory at his headquarters in three months, was due to the events of the weekend, which were re-updated in the form of a television interview, broadcast just before the start of the game, which had been granted by goalkeeper Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions that others make, and not Jens, Heldt faced harsh criticism from Lehmann.
He had blamed weakness in the direction of the board of directors, which had decided to change coaches due to pressure from teenage fans.
Lehmann also called his day off after the games a sign of lack of sovereignty and hostility.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by sheer selfishness," Heldt said, and he announced consequences for the back.
They probably won't be friends forever, the two forties.
But at least they agreed with everyone else that, without the previous efforts with the substituted coach's team, the spectacle of great game and battle force would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had “an important share in the success,” Heldt and Lehmann said in unison; and so did the man in the plastic suitcase.
World Heavyweight Championship Wrestling
Fiery duel in Bern: again and again the challenger Kevin Johnsonn was provoking the world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title in the WBC version.
The judges' verdict was unanimous.
Hamburg: Vitali Klitschko remains world heavyweight champion.
The 38-year-old WBC association champion beat American Kevin Johnson by unanimous points decision (120:108, 120:108, 119:109) in Bern on Friday night.
For Klitschko it was his third successful title defense since his return in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was already twice world champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to perform the knockout that everyone had expected.
Klitschko expanded his record to 39 wins in 41 professional fights, twice having to give up due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept the first loss in his 24th fight.
In front of about 17,000 spectators at the Bern Arena, Klitschko, with a height of 2.02 meters, wanted to dictate the fight especially with his left hand.
But Johnson, eleven centimeters lower, who before the duel had proclaimed the end of the Klitschko era, was dodging again and again the blows of the world champion, so Klitschko could not bring decisively to his goal his dangerous right.
Generally speaking, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger, and only tried to pass the rounds.
While he was provoking Klitschko with words and gestures, his punches only rarely caught up with the world champion.
However, he is now the second boxer, after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who endured twelve full rounds with Klitschko.
Before the fight, the challenger had already produced some scandal in the Swiss capital.
He had insulted Klitschko as a "horrible zombie", who "can't do anything".
When he did the weigh-in, the champion let himself be provoked on Friday to remove Johnson's sunglasses from his nose "so he could see his eyes."
Fourth win after Klitschko's return
Also in his fourth fight after his return on October 11, 2008, Klitschko remained invincible.
After a nearly four-year hiatus, he beat then-Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin, and had regained "his" WBC belt, which he had previously had to surrender without a fight.
That year he beat Juan Carlos G<0xC3><0xB3>mez of Cuba in his title defenses and Chris Arreola of the United States in September.
In this fight I only got one hit, and I am in very good physical condition, Klitschko had explained his quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains to gather all four important titles in his family.
His brother Vladimir is the WBO and IBF World Champion.
However, the belt belongs to the British David Haye, after he dethroned in November Nikolai Valujev, 2.13 meters tall.
The previous summer, Haye had canceled a fight against Vitali Klitschko planned for September.
Allegedly, the company promoting it is already planning the fight against Klitschko at London’s Wembley Stadium.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack of the opposition: the head of the Greens group, J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Trittin, called the Minister of Defense, Gutenberg, a liar due to false information about the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and the leftists demand an explanation from the chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin – Following the latest revelations about the Kunduz airstrike, the opposition has accused Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU) of knowingly deceiving.
In Saturday's "Tagesschau" news broadcast on the ARD television channel, the head of the Greens group, J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Trittin, said the minister "knowingly did not tell the truth" about the deadly bombing of two convoys.
In such a case, it is usually said: he told lies.
The order to kill would have been given without regard to the rules of the International Protection Troop for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the report that NATO had, and that Mr. Gutenberg has read, Trittin said.
On Friday, it was reported that the attack was not only aimed at destroying the hijacked trucks, but also at intentionally killing two Taliban leaders.
In the US airstrike, requested by the German commander of Kunduz, Colonel Klein, according to the NATO investigation report, up to 142 people were killed or injured.
The Greens, the SPD and the left on Saturday urged Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to immediately address the federal parliament and clarify what Gutenberg really knew about the incident.
Mrs Merkel needs to clarify whether an intentional assassination strategy is part of the Afghan policy of the federal government, and whether the chancellery, the army and the intelligence service have approved this new strategy, J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Trittin and his Green colleague Renate K<0xC3><0xBC>nast demanded.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm resolutely rejected the criticism.
The foreign ministry had no influence on specific actions of the German army in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, doubts had also been cast over the Ministry’s presentation of the reasons for the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to information from SPIEGEL, both had informed Gutenberg correctly and completely about the background of the attack on the convoys.
Officially it had been said that they had denied the existence of the NATO reports and had withheld sensitive details from the Minister.
However, from the environment of the two high-ranking officials it transpired that they had even pointed out to the Ministry of Defense the existence of several reports, including a two-page document of Colonel Klein, who was in command, and a report of a field patrol.
In the meantime, Wichert reportedly asked in a letter to clarify the matter, reports the newspaper "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung".
So far, no response has been received, it was said.
The ministry did not speak out on Saturday about the charges against it, noting that this would be clarified in the Federal Parliament’s commission of inquiry, which will be constituted next Wednesday.
Dreamworlds
In the waking state, some people see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
It is not only in the case of the mentally ill and drug addicts that the boundaries between imagination and reality are blurred.
As long as it happens during sleep, everything is in order.
When we are lying in our dark rooms with our eyes closed, we can unfettered surrender to the wildest imaginations and creations of fantasy.
However, one who experiences sleep-like states during wakefulness, or sees and hears things that others do not see and hear, is most often considered in the modern Western world as crazy or drug addicted, or at least manic.
But such images and voices do not only arise in the mentally ill or in drug addicts.
Our imagination is to blame: the same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels, sometimes blur the boundaries between dream, madness and reality.
Dream-modified states of alert consciousness can appear in the most diverse forms, at best we call them visions, and at worst, madness.
Although triggers and effects can be distinguished, similar processes can be traced back to the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the psychedelic experiences of New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, states of shamanic possession, and psychoses and hallucinations.
Hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of the neuronal communication substances in the brain – especially dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine – has been derailed and the interaction between various parts of it is disturbed.
During a schizophrenic psychosis very often appear complex hallucinations and crazed thoughts.
Gravity no longer has power over it.
The relationship between madness and sleep has occupied philosophers and doctors since ancient times.
Aristotle conceived of hallucinations as a form of waking sleep, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, noted in 1861 a "great resemblance of the state of madness with dream states", for Sigmund Freud, the dream was even "a psychosis, with all these nonsense, crazy formations, and"
It’s the fall of 2001, when Henning T. becomes a comic book figure.
His body is two-dimensional and outrageously colorful.
Gravity no longer has power over it, it is floating near the ceiling of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind him, figures of demons with wings, with blood-red grimaces, misshapen, grinding their teeth.
They are chasing him, they kick him with heavy and flaming boots, they throw him against the walls, he feels the pains all over his body.
Loud, malignant voices echo from the walls and the radio.
He can no longer bear them, the voices that insult and offend him.
Henning T. rips two cables from the stereo, ties them together to form a hanging knot, and attaches them to a hook on the ceiling.
He climbs on a horn and puts the knot around his neck.
Jump in.
The rope comes loose.
Let it be a lesson for you!, shout the voices in a chorus that bursts his eardrums, "go to the clinic and make them cure you!"
Now, Henning T. is 40 years old and has experienced six acute psychoses, the last two years ago, the first nearly 20 years ago.
The cause was LSD.
His diagnosis is schizo-affective-paranoid psychosis, he is also manic-depressive, he takes medication, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
In psychosis I have experienced the most terrible anguish and the deepest despair, he says.
Hallucinations are a cruel reality
Approximately one percent of the population falls ill at least once in the lifetime of schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most frequent disease after depression.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, most of the time those affected can no longer distinguish between the outside and the inside world, and they fall into a state of over-excitement that can lead to hallucinations, delusions of grandeur, relationship disorders, or persecutory mania.
Especially widespread is the hearing of voices: voices that give orders, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also common.
The affected person is no longer able to distinguish how important it is from what is not, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like sleep, psychosis also opens the floodgates to a torrent of ideas and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is subject-centered, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief physician of the general psychiatry clinic at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is at the center of events, everything has a meaning addressed to him.
At the same time he enters into a passive role, as in a dream, he feels overwhelmed by events and cannot actively organize them.
This is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general it is not possible to adjust reality to them, hallucinations are a cruel reality, waking up, impossible.
Experiencing a hallucination once in a lifetime
Unlike in a dream, says Fuchs, "the spatial and sensory structure of reality that is perceived in psychosis remains in principle as it is."
Paranoid thoughts and hallucinations rely on reality, the distancing from experience takes place in reality.
Researchers still don’t know why our brains go crazy.
According to Fuchs, states of emergency can lead anyone to temporarily lose touch with reality.
But not all people develop psychosis.
There appears to be a genetic disposition for schizophrenia, but studies in twins have shown that in addition to genes there are other determining factors as well.
The researchers assume that those affected suffer minimal brain damage.
We suspect that the neuronal maturity of the brain is affected at an early stage of development, such as through a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But it remains unknown how this alteration of the neuronal system occurs, which also does not manifest itself at all for many years.
Also the influence of the environment plays an important role – stress or a traumatic experience can be the triggers of a psychosis when there is already a previous disposition.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can cause psychosis, as they interfere with the brain’s transmitter system.
When the brain heats up
The illogical thing about all this is that psychotic people suffer with their hallucinations and take very expensive drugs to get rid of them, while others pay for drugs that allow them to experience some, says psychology professor Erich Kasten of L<0xC3><0xBC>beck.
The perception of a hallucination as pleasant or not often depends on the point of view.
Kasten has been compiling reports on hallucinations and visions for ten years and has analyzed the results in the book Die unreale Welt in unserem Kopf (The Unreal World in Our Head), published last year.
Hallucinations are among the typical accompanying symptoms of psychoses, but also, surprisingly, of many other diseases.
Among them are, along with mental disorders such as borderline personality disorder or depression, often also diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's and head injuries .
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, the brains of healthy people also suffer from hallucinations.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, are made up of memories that are normally repressed.
They arise when the areas of the brain in which sensory perceptions are processed are overactive or uninhibited; when our brain warms up, but also when stimuli are lacking.
Drugs can cause this state in the same way as brain damage or psychosis.
But also the restriction of stimuli, stress, the evil of loves or other exceptional brain states.
In j<0xC3><0xBC>ngeren Studien gab bis zu einem Drittel der Befragten an, mindestens einmal im Leben eine Halluzination erlebt zu haben.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. was 16 years old, living in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and attending a secondary school.
An ordinary girl.
If it weren't for those images and the voices.
Sometimes, during recess, it happens that a clumsy boy with long, dark hair speaks to him.
When she answers, the other students look at her in amazement; no one but her hears or sees the boy.
They think the shy girl is a strange dreamer, but Sarah K. knows she's not dreaming.
She's awake and she sees and hears that boy, the same way she sees and hears the girl sitting on the bench next door.
You can even feel their presence, at least for a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, he likes the guy.
Sometimes he wonders if she's crazy.
He also knows that the boy and the rest of the visions are not real and disappear.
At night, the apparitions are alarming.
Visions are often a burden.
When he is in class he can sometimes not follow the lesson because the teacher – in his eyes and ears – is presenting a new partner, while for the rest he explains in a visible and audible way the mathematical equations.
At night, the apparitions are alarming.
As she waits in the dark room for sleep, which often comes late and is scarce, she can’t tell whether she’s awake or dreaming, whether the images she sees, the grimaces or the girl with bleeding cuts on her arms and legs, appear in front of her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, he screams at the figures.
Her parents and friends haven't heard from her, they'd think she's crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She passed selectivity last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, the hallucinations disappeared.
Ever since you've come into contact over the Internet with psychologist Kasten, you know you're not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art out of desperation.
According to Kasten, when a person is socially isolated or suffers a restriction of stimuli, it is very likely that after a while they begin to have hallucinations.
I believe that the brain is unoccupied and is responsible for seeking entertainment.
Sarah K., an only child, had a small fear of other children and often played alone.
His hallucinations began when, at the age of 13, he learned that the man he’s called dad since he’s had reason isn’t his biological father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same areas of the brain that also process real impressions and noises, those affected like Sarah K. find it difficult to distinguish between visions and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "takes place in the brain, reality is projected there.
Hallucinations are also images that the brain produces, which is why they seem so real.”
Kasten also classifies nocturnal fantasies as a form of hallucination.
Hallucinations of healthy people do not differ fundamentally from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, psychically healthy people are able to recognize their visions as unreal.
Kasten therefore recommends his patients to appreciate their hallucinations as a special skill.
Boundary between sleep and hallucination
In this overly conscious world, imaginary experiences are usually pathologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, a professor at Heidelberg and chief physician of the psychiatry and psychotherapy clinic at Florence-Nightingale-Krankenhauses hospital in D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf.
A psychosis is a hard and painful illness but it also involves something positive and creative – madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has investigated so-called Oneirism, a special form of consciousness, which is perceived as if it were a dream.
Dream hallucinations are almost very complex and detailed dreams that the person who experiences them considers real and that subsequently can not differentiate from being awake.
Oneiric conscious states arise in extreme situations associated with trauma or disease, such as in patients with polyradiculoneuropathy, who experience motor paralysis while being fully conscious. die bei vollem Bewusstsein eine motorische L<0xC3><0xA4>hmung erleben.
According to Schmidt-Degenhardt, when a person is threatened by a loss of self or of the world due to a total and permanent motor disability, it replaces a very dangerous real situation with an own and imaginary world that is decoupled from reality.
A form of borderline situation between sleep and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome a situation in reality, a change of world occurs, although the real situation is still present in the imagination.
An intensive way of giving meaning and interpretation to an unbearable situation in itself that our own creative capacity allows us not to sink into the nothingness of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
Art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen of Zurich describes his dream experiences in his book Herzenwechsel as a soul-saving action.
He was 49 years old, when his consciousness embarked on multi-day trips after heart valve surgery with heart transplantation included, while his body was condemned to immobility in the intensive care station.
Claussen immersed himself in a world created by himself and visited strange places of other times: he found himself prostrate in bed, an older man on board a sanatorium on a train, a robot watching over his health.
It was seen in the early Middle Ages, surrounded by nobles who produced narcotics from blood.
A Greek man on a motorcycle kidnapped him in his home country, surfed on his hospital bed in the Alps with firn snow and ran into a Korean mobster.
It gives everything in these imaginary facts, everything is real, even later in the memories.
For Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
Dreaming is a different state, so describe your experience.
On the contrary, the memories of mental journeys are, many years later, much clearer, even in irrelevant details.
Even clearer and more intensive than real experiences.
The intensity of this experience dilutes the horizon of the rest of our everyday experiences, adds psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, oneirism, psychosis, hallucinations and drug use show how fragile the inner reproduction of external reality is, even when we are awake.
Each modification of the state of consciousness, summarizes the psychologist Kasten, "can lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that, on the other hand, can be completely enriching.
The snow can come.
Burda
The children will take over the publishing house at the age of 27.
The new publisher Kallen has reached an interim solution: Hubert Burda wants to leave his company in the future in the hands of his two sons, he told SPIEGEL.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
Hamburg – Publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the future.
The two sons become heirs at the age of 27 and have the firm will to enter the company, Burda, 69, confirmed to SPIEGEL.
The details have been arranged as a precautionary measure.
The next question is whether they will actively participate in the company.
Also, if you are qualified for it.
One cannot put one’s children in front of 7,500 workers if they are not sufficiently trained for it.
That would end the children and also the company.
Burda announced Thursday that he will step down as chairman of the board in January and that Paul-Bernhard Kallen has been named his successor.
This member of the Kallen family, 52 is since 1999 member of the management of Burda.
Initially, he was responsible for technology.
After the departure of J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Todenh<0xC3><0xB6>fer, he also took charge of direct marketing, foreign sales, printing and finance.
For the first time, no member of the family occupies the top of the editorial board.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old, and her son Felix, now 42, died a few years ago.
Kallen’s designation also serves to, “save the 10, 15 year differences,” according to Burda.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
Looking at the Schickedanz and Schaeffle cases, Burda said that family businesses are also not safe from decline: "This has always affected families who get infected by the urge to seek capital, who have misjudged and thought they could rise as well as the biggest player.
That's never been my strategy.
I’ve never had “delusions of grandeur,” Burda says.
I don’t see myself as a political preceptor of this country, as Springer was, and I don’t want to play Time in the world league either; those deals have gotten too big.
Integral Beauty
Everything you could want – in terms of beauty and well-being – at your fingertips.
This is what seems to have been proposed El Corte Inglés, which has just inaugurated in the shopping center of Callao (Madrid) a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2 dedicated to the care and pampering of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, has prestigious firms such as Hedonai -which is responsible for laser hair removal-; Spaxi<0xC3><0xB3>n, with relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments; Luis & Tachi hairdressers; Marina d'Or, which has a gym, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a feeding section, where the tea shop stands out, with more than 130 different kinds of this infusion.
Enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner while you contemplate the unbeatable views of the capital, or rent for two hours the relaxation area to set up your own 'beauty party' with eight of your friends and relax with a session of jacuzzi, massages and having a glass of champagne are some of the possibilities that Spaxi<0xC3><0xB3>n offers.
In total there are 250 m2 distributed in 12 rooms to perform the latest and most innovative facial, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
As, for example, cavitation to combat cellulite or vibratory platforms.
The gym also has these machines, as well as virtual 'coaches' that guide the steps of customers, offering them a totally personalized treatment.
It all starts by entering your personal key on a touch screen, located in front of the machine.
Then, several videos show us how to correctly perform our exercise table.
The director says that 15 minutes (including warm-up and stretching) is enough to exercise all the muscles of the body.
And, if after exercising our body, we want to go through the hairdresser, the firm Luis & Tachi has a room where rituals of hair recovery, luminosity or nutrition are offered in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the premises of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year, from 10:00 in the morning to 22:00 in the evening.
Varied necklines
Christmas is coming and it never hurts to review the looks of the stars to adapt them to our party wardrobe.
The shape of the neckline, very important to enhance the silhouette, is one of the variables that we must take into account.
Here are a few suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated neckline. It is not very advisable.
Endesa and Barcelona, with the electric car
The electricity company Endesa, together with the Barcelona City Council, have created the 'Live Office'.
This is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The LIVE Office (Logistics for the Implementation of the Electric Vehicle) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the implementation of the electric car in the city and will achieve agreements around mobility, managing, coordinating, presenting subsidies, etc.
On the other hand, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
In short, it is intended to boost what will be the transport of the future.
3 "Electric Cities"
But Barcelona is not the only city that is going to be involved in the implementation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville join the project.
They are the three cities chosen by the Government, within the MOVELE Plan, to promote the implementation of the electric vehicle.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat of Catalonia.
This is intended to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These would include activities linked to energy and in particular to energy efficiency.
It is not the only initiative in which Endesa participates in terms of the promotion of electric vehicles.
The company participates in standardization groups at European level and has active a series of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees 'a horizon of tranquility' for the motor sector
The president of the Government, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero, envisions "a horizon of tranquility" for the Spanish automotive industry, which, he recalled, is the main export sector of the country.
In the presentation of the Economic Report of the President of the Government for 2009, Zapatero reviewed the measures that the Executive has implemented throughout the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without the Automotive Competitiveness Plan, today we would have a scenario of abandonment, of closure of some of our main production plants," said the President of the Government.
"Thanks to this plan and the willingness of the brands to follow in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can have a horizon of tranquility for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this sense, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Comprehensive Automotive Plan (PIA), allocated 800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which mobilized an investment of more than 3 billion euros.
The chief executive explained that this investment was committed both to the development of new models and to modernizing existing products and processes.
Zapatero also emphasized government measures to support demand, in reference to Plan 2000E, implemented in collaboration with the autonomous communities and car brands.
According to the president, this plan has reduced the average emissions of new vehicles marketed in the Spanish market by 6% and has led to a "strong increase" in registrations, which grew "40 percent" in November.
20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
The first edition of the International Classic Vehicle Show will be held in Madrid, a meeting space for professionals and fans of the world of motoring.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Glass Pavilion of the Casa de Campo in Madrid.
It is an exhibition area of 20,000 square meters in which there will be more than 200 national and international exhibitors.
Not only can you find motorcycles and classic cars, but in ClassicAuto Madrid you will find items of all kinds related to the motor world.
Thus, among the exhibitors of the pavilion, you can find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of items related to the world of the classic engine that will delight collectors and curious.
Among the participating companies will be, among others, Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, restoration; Coupe-Francisco Pueche car sales and restoration; or Cochera Clásicos, Mercedes Benz specialist.
Skill Tests Abroad
In addition, the commercial activity of this Hall will be completed with parallel activities: celebration of concentrations, sports exhibitions, skill tests, presentations and competitions.
Skill tests will also be carried out with classic cars and motorcycles on an enabled circuit outside the fairgrounds.
Mazda3 i-Stop: sustainable sportiness
Mazda wants to show that sportiness is not at odds with respect for the environment.
For this reason, the Mazda3 has just incorporated the engine stop and start system -christened as i-Stop-, a device that at least for the moment is only available with the 2.0 petrol engine with 150 horsepower.
This second generation of the Mazda3 stands out for the good note achieved as a whole.
The finishes, the completion of the vehicle, the habitability, the behavior, the mechanics, the i-Stop system...
All these aspects are outstanding in the new Mazda3.
Starting from the driver’s seat, we found that the front seats have excellent ergonomics and support.
Also, the feel of the steering wheel is exquisite.
Continuing with the set formed by the instrument panel and the console we see how Mazda has continued the Japanese trend of creating a futuristic interior design, with a large number of buttons and controls and striking colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of the Honda Civic.
Therefore, we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and more specifically the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to beat.
Continuing with the cabin, this compact Japanese has more than enough room for four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
To all this is added a large trunk with regular shapes.
The automatic engine stop and start system, at least for the time being, is only available with the two-liter, 150-horsepower petrol engine and with the six-speed manual gearbox.
This engine is a real delight. It stands out for its finesse, for its low noise, for its performance and for achieving low consumption.
Although the most demanded Mazda3 will be the diesel versions, those who do not make a high number of kilometers a year should not rule out this i-Stop with gasoline engine, both for its high driving comfort, as for its contained consumption.
Regarding the level of equipment, the version chosen for the test is the so-called Sportive, that is to say the one that incorporates a greater number of series elements.
The standard equipment includes the Lane Departure Assist (RVM), which eliminates blind spots, traction and stability controls, speed control, the photosensitive interior mirror, the on-board computer on a large screen, parking sensors, independent climate control, rain and light sensors, bluetooth and bluetooth audio and 17-inch alloy wheels.
In addition, as if its equipment were not enough, this version had the Premium Pack, which adds for 1,500 euros: bixenon adaptive headlights and BOSE sound system with disc charger, among other elements.
CONCLUSION
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its category.
It stands out especially for the quality of the materials used, for its behavior and for the high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not drive many kilometres a year will be able to opt for this i-Stop version, associated only with the 150-horsepower 2.0-litre petrol engine.
The only drawback of this model is its high price, which is between 21,770 euros of the Luxury finish and 23,270 euros of the tested version -Sportive-.
In exchange for this high figure, the Mazda3 will offer us every day large doses of satisfaction.
Luxury 'Premiere'
L.A. covers the red carpet of sensuality with Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars dazzled more than ever wrapped in such elegant models as 'sexys' at the premiere of 'Nine'. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our 'Pe', as sophisticated as usual, opted for a dark 'lady'.
The promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device that only serves to look at the mail, without even being able to see certain types of attachments or browse the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the U.S. when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
To see it on the street is more difficult, the truth, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek has a very low price and a very low monthly fee, less than half of what you pay, for example, for the iPhone data plan.
After the success, the company has released two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free data service for life in exchange for paying six times more for the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It’s just as limited as its American counterpart, but it comes with a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price of about 12 euros per month includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone already know what it is like to have to give up data when crossing the border or desperately look for a cafe with WiFi (or a Fon connection) to be able to consult the mail.
The idea of fixed-price roaming is incredibly attractive and has long been in the works.
Yes, some operators have special agreements and travel plans, but in my experience it takes a Ph.D. in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the fine print.
The European Commission’s repeated tug-of-war to achieve affordable roaming rates for all of Europe has barely had a noticeable effect.
Outside the home country there is fear of using the data, and rightly so.
That a device like FonPeek (it is curious that it bears the name of Fon when it lacks Wifi) gets this type of rates means that operators start to think differently and study different proposals with which to amortize their data network.
Kindle is another good example, it includes download traffic from books and other queries on the Internet.
No contracts and no bagpipes.
It is a connected device and you pay for it when you buy it, not month by month.
And that’s what I hope to see one day with FonPeek, a lifetime-access purchase option like the one Peek already has in the U.S.
Not because I'm going to buy it.
I look at my email on the phone, thank you.
I hope so because I think it’s a fairer model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with this same system.
Michelle's Fetish Color
Yellow is, without a doubt, the preferred tone of the American first lady.
If you have already attended the inauguration of Barack Obama as President of the United States with a dress and a coat of this color, you have chosen the same to accompany him in, without a doubt, the second most important moment of his life: the collection in Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama has worn a very similar model on both occasions: in addition to being a similar color -greenish yellow with bright reflections-, the two times the outfit consisted of three pieces -dress, jacket and coat of the same fabric-, and was adorned with a large embroidery or necklace.
So much so, that at first glance it seemed that the first lady of the United States followed in the wake of the Princess of Asturias and had chosen to repeat the costume.
But the fabric in which the two suits are made makes them very different.
If for the inauguration he was dealing with a fat lace, in Oslo it is a velvet with print.
The complements have also varied: green half-heel shoes the other time, and a similar model, but in gold, now.
And equally different is the hairstyle: one picked up this time, mane looses the previous one.
75% of working mothers have had work problems due to their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of the younger generations who want to be mothers.
This is revealed by the study 'Fecundity and work history of women in Spain', prepared by the CSIC in collaboration with the Women's Institute.
The survey conducted among 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 leaves no doubt about it: 75% of working mothers have seen limited opportunities in the workplace due to motherhood.
The study points out that there are many differences in the beginning of living together as a couple and the number of children, depending on whether or not they work and the type of work they develop.
Those who do not have an activity outside the home, work part-time, or have an unstable job, start living together as a couple, advance the first maternity, and have more children.
On the contrary, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, delay cohabitation and motherhood, and have fewer offspring.
"Women between 35 and 49 years old with fixed work have the first child, on average, 3.7 years after starting living together, a figure that increases to 4.1 women with fixed jobs have needed more time from their life trajectory to get them, which has led them to postpone the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of work performed exerts a lot of influence on motherhood, but less on the timing of the pairing," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that differentiates the age of women when they get married and when they have the first offspring.
According to the survey, the higher the educational level, the higher the age at which they marry and have their first child.
The difference is also maintained among women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49 age group, those with elementary and higher education were first-time mothers at 25.1 and 32.1 on average, respectively.
"Another division is also established among women according to their level of education.
While those with elementary studies get married and have their first child before getting a stable job, those of medium or higher levels invest this sequence and give priority to obtaining a stable job as a condition prior to marriage and the arrival of a child, "details Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also worth it.
L’Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its envied list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
Starting next year, the German actress will become an image of different products of the brand, singing the universal motto of 'Because I'm worth it'.
The protagonist of 'Joyeux No<0xC3><0xAB>l', one of the most elegant actresses on the international scene, joins other famous signings of L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter such a select club were actresses Evangeline Lilly ('Lost') and Freida Pinto ('Slumdog Millionaire').
In the male section, the cosmetic brand also has luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ('Grey's Anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's partner in 'Lost').
British Fashion Awards
Brits have a lot to say in the fashion world.
Its highest representatives - designers and models, yesterday and today - gathered at the annual awards ceremony, held in London, at the Royal Court os Justice.
No one was missing from the meeting.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter, Georgia May Jagger, voted Best Model of the Year.
Manuel Vicent's Poker
Manuel Vicent presents in 'Poquer de ases' (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) about thirty x-rays of writers who have gone through his literary life (and, in cases, also through the other).
It does not do so in predictable and fearsome genres (biographical resemblance, life and work), but looking for something similar to the nucleus of ignition of the creative character.
The journey has its excitements and Vicent does not spare scares or illuminations.
In addition to an exquisite pleasure, the book is a moving invitation to readings and re-readings.
Here are some snapshots.
On Albert Camus: "In its pages I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical drive, the same one that I felt without giving it a name: pleasure against fate, morality without guilt and innocence without any god."
Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorical Christian, wrote what he had in his blood, not in his intellect, between impotence and ignorance, with a dazzling, senseless poetic humour, like the blade of the knife that was about to kill him."
On Graham Greene: "Our man was abducted by this woman with a passion that lasted thirteen years, in whose flesh he combined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted in reaching heaven through the road to perdition."
About James Joyce: "The 'Ulysses' was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the peaks of eight thousand meters of universal literature, which must be climbed by the north wall, from which the best mountaineers descend again and again."
About William Faulkner: "He was a weird guy.
Of himself, he sometimes said that he was the heir of a county landowner and sometimes that he was the son of a black woman and a crocodile.
Both dreams were of greatness."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer picked up the demented cry launched from a bridge by that Munich character to carry his echo to the bottom of the night of the twentieth century in his literary form and did so on a journey fleeing from himself and invoking posterity with a violent speech to the worms."
About Dorothy Parker: “One day she got down on her knees and prayed, ‘Dear God, please make me stop writing like a woman.’
On his tomb were engraved these verses of Spenser: 'The dream after the effort, / after the storm the harbor, / the rest after the war, / after the life full pleases the death.'
About Virginia Wolf: "In the luggage she also brought her depressions.
The husband accepted with all normality that she would tell him that Edward VII was spying on her among the azaleas or that the birds sang in Greek.
There has never been a man so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was ahead of his madness.
On P<0xC3><0xAD>o Baroja: "What did Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n-Santos do but try to inoculate Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet attempt but to put Baroja through Faulkner's arms?
What did it do but abduct the fame of that man to serve as his own pedestal?
Cowardly aggression
Last week, my mother of about 70 years of age was walking through our neighborhood in the municipality of Fuenlabrada when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years old passed by her and our dog, a mestizo breed, rescued from the kennel and with no more than six kilos of weight and, without a word, they gave him two kicks that left the injured dog.
Our indignation is capital because we do not find the fun in a gratuitous aggression to a small and defenseless animal, which, by the way, was tied.
To this must be added the suffocation that provoked a lady who walked quietly and who, when she rebuked these individuals, came to fear for her physical integrity, since an energetic who attacks an animal, is able to do the same with a woman, a child, an old man or, ultimately, with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The event took place at five o’clock in the afternoon on any Tuesday in a traditionally quiet neighborhood.
The dog was crying all day.
By the way, we put a complaint in a nearby police station that we doubt would serve for a long time and not to generate susceptibilities, just clarify that the cowardly murderers were Spanish.
Outrage has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand that it is happening among young people so that they consider it fun to mistreat a helpless animal for free that gives us affection, company and friendship.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people have gone.
Michelin and Fesvial together for helmet use
The manufacturer of tires Michelin, with the collaboration of the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote the use of the helmet, mainly among younger motorists, reported today both entities.
This initiative seeks to raise awareness about the importance of using the helmet, since it is the only element of protection capable of avoiding head injuries or even death in the event of an accident while riding a motorcycle.
Michelin said that this campaign is part of its commitment to road safety, which “goes beyond designing and manufacturing safer products every day” and affirmed that it also contributes to this goal through other educational and informative actions.
This new campaign to promote the use of the helmet on the motorcycle, under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will have a first phase in which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle workshops, with the aim of achieving maximum dissemination.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, since being a manufacturer of tires for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main purposes is to develop increasingly safer products.
Up the sale of light commercials
Almost two years later, the light commercial vehicle market is starting to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 units that were registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of declines, according to figures from the employers of Anfac manufacturers and that of Ganvam sellers.
The good data, however, should be put in quarantine since the reference with which the comparison is made - November 2008 - was particularly bad, with a decrease of 60% compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the upturn of the last month, the registrations accumulated in these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, 95,853 units have been sold in addition to all the vehicles that make up the tailoring drawer of light commercials: derived from passenger cars, pick up, vans, light vans and light trucks / chassis.
Likewise, the clouds that most affect their demand have not disappeared, because although they are also acquired by individuals, most of the purchases are made by small and medium-sized companies, which pay in almost 100% of cases through external financing.
Thus, in addition to the restrictions imposed by the closed tap of bank loans, there are other factors such as the increase in unemployment levels or the persistence of the bad economic situation.
In the face of this panorama and unlike the cars, the aid for the purchase of the 2000E has been of little use.
They can be used, in addition to individuals, the self-employed and SMEs who are going to acquire a light commercial of up to 3.5 tons with a level of CO2 emissions that does not exceed 160 grams per kilometer, but the number of operations has been testimonial.
Just yesterday, from Ganvam they recalled the need to devote special attention on the part of the Administration to these vehicles and also to the industrialists (trucks and buses).
The association of sellers forecasts a 2010 similar to the year that ends, for which it calculates a fall in sales (of passenger cars and 4x4) of 19%.
Emergency braking assistance is now mandatory
As with ABS anti-lock braking and ESP stability control, emergency braking assistance systems will have to be a mandatory element in European cars.
In fact, they are already in all passenger cars and light commercial vehicles of new registration, while for the rest a grace period is fixed until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to increase the protection of pedestrians although, due to its way of working, it can also help avoid many collisions by range.
The emergency braking assistant increases the pressure on the brakes in the event of an emergency, which the system detects by the driver’s stomp.
But he doesn’t always maintain that pressure until the end.
According to a study carried out by the manufacturer of components for cars Bosch, a third of the drivers involved in an accident had not come to step on the brake before the collision and half of them did not take advantage of all the force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, on the other hand, demands the maximum from the braking system, reducing the distance used by the car to stop.
According to a study by the EU itself, if all cars were equipped with this type of elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided per year.
The reduction will be even greater – it is estimated that one in four claims with damage to people would be avoided – when the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems are popularized.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that (through a radar or a camera) detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to slightly acting on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it helps by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
In case it does not react, and even if the collision is unavoidable, the device exerts maximum effort to the brakes to minimize damage.
General Motors delays Opel plan until January
While workers at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April - probably on the 8th - according to Javier Ortega, the American manufacturer warns that it will need more time to conclude the recovery plan for Opel.
What Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, wants is that each of the points of the plan has been previously agreed by the affected party.
And this may cause the final document that will be submitted to the workers first and then to the governments of the countries in which there are factories, to be delayed until early 2010.
GM has said that a decision on the sale of Saab should be made in the coming days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the American manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to having contact with some potential new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, which also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the option of the Dutch manufacturer of sports cars Skyper, which is backed by the Russian group Converg, is gaining strength.
If there were no deal with any of them, GM could sell some of Saab’s assets to China’s Baic.
The decision remains to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To develop its latest, and expensive jewel, Porsche engineers took the Boxster S as a base and managed to lose no less than 80 kilos, which has left the scale at only 1,275 kilos.
This led them to do without, in the first place, the automatic roof that has been supplied by one of canvas with manual operation, with which 21 kilos are saved; using aluminum doors like those of the GT3, 15 others 'fall'; removing the air conditioner, 13; reducing the fuel tank from 64 to 54 liters, five more kilos were gained; mounting sports racks another 12 and with the light tires 19.
Finally, giving up the CDR-30 audio system contributed another six kilograms and changing the door handles for fabric, the remaining kilo.
Although also offered with the PDK dual-clutch gearbox, the test was conducted on a unit with the six-speed manual gearbox, mainly on California secondary roads, on mountain stretches with really twisty tracks.
Their behavior can only be described as faultless.
The weight reduction does not mean that the car does not tread the asphalt with aplomb.
Quite the opposite: we haven’t tested a model so small and light that it transmits so much safety in cornering, even at high speeds.
He is a small athlete, able to warm his muscles in a short gait for the necessary time, until we order him to sprint, to brake, to recover and to squeeze his engine again...
What we ask. Thanks to its direction, as communicative as it is precise, what we indicate with our hands on the steering wheel is what the car will do.
And it will do so with surgical precision.
Engine sound at will
The sound of its V6 boxer, with 320 horsepower (10 more than the Boxster S) is very achieved and can be enhanced with the 'sport' option and through a system that modifies the roar of the engine, already released previously in the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, either from standing still or in recoveries.
The suspensions are firm, but not harsh or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the roads that we crossed with the Boxster Spyder was quite punished, but the car digested the potholes well.
The electronic aids barely made an appearance all the way; and that in some of the curves we find ice at dawn and gravel, already well into the morning.
In short, an ultralight car, one of the most fun to drive that one can on the market and that is something more than a simple modification of the Boxster S.
The car will go on sale in February 2010, priced at 70,831 euros.
'Bag Girl'
Intimate to Karl Lagerfeld, image of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional 'starlette' of the fashion shows of the 'maison', the singer lavishes her malota face with as much contumacy as her Chanel bags.
More than 'Bad Girl' or 'It Girl', she's a 'Bag Girl'.
Baskonia wins a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral achieved a brilliant win by 82-91 in its visit to the complicated Maccabi Electra court, despite the numerous casualties that Dusko Ivanovic’s team had, and in this way it is placed in the leadership of its group, after the great performance of Mirza Teletovic, who with eight triples scored was the best of his team (29 evaluation).
The Victorian team was able to make up for the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with large doses of involvement and collective work although it had to suffer until the end to win.
In addition, the great success from the perimeter, with 16 triples scored had a lot to do with the final triumph.
The match began in the face for the Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a, who were placed from the beginning ahead in the scoreboard.
That the first four baskets of the Victorians were from the perimeter already foreshadowed that they had jumped onto the Israeli court with hot dolls.
English and Teletovic were the main architects of the 18-20 at the end of the first half.
The second quarter was more of the same, but the Alavés team opted for Barac’s inside game and the work of Eliyahu, who was received with whistles and applause on the return to what was his home, to continue expanding his advantage at rest (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, although the 'minus six' of Splitter's rating already foreshadowed that this was not going to be the best night of the Brazilian.
But the game, despite being on track at rest, was not decided at all and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Victorians that on their court no one wins, and with 'the hand of Elijah' squeezing they managed to get into the game.
Eidson and Pnini played a decisive role in turning the 'yellows' around (50-49).
More inconveniences
Ivanovic’s, wounded but not much less dead, needed to spin a couple of plays with success to catch air, and in those came Mirza Teletovic’s machine gun, which with three almost consecutive triples and the help of English and Ribas returned the score to a reassuring income (54-67), which they managed to make up the premises at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Alavese left to leave the skin in the last partial and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already warned that they were not going to let anyone take away what had been deserved during the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign and tried to keep their team alive from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated by fouls, Ivanovic's team did not rush, they defended well, and although the Israelis approached in the final minute (80-85), the match already had an owner and the victory escaped from Tel Aviv for the first time in the season.
Injuries prevent Unicaja from fighting
Unicaja lost resoundingly in Greece against Olympiacos and gave it the lead of group B of the Euroleague, in a match marked by the losses of the cashiers, especially in the home game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team was not scared by the atmosphere of the Peace and Friendship pavilion and also by the entity of the rival, perhaps the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
An aggressive defense and three consecutive 3-pointers, two from the base Omar Cook and one from Guillem Rubio, dazzled the locals 12-18, minute 9.
Olympiacos were surprised by the intensity of Unicaja, although the arsenal of the locals in the indoor game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, turned the score 22-20, minute 13, at which point an action, with a fight, between the two American bases Beverley and Williams, meant the disqualification of both players.
The Greek team began to work showing its superiority within both areas, where the loss due to injury of the English center Joel Freeland and the three personal faults of Carlos Jimenez, were weighing down the cashiers.
Between the insiders and Lithuanian forward Linas Kleizas, with his triples, they increased the lead 44-32, minute 19.
An impossible comeback
The third period was very offensive with Olympiacos, who despite the 19 losses, was superior and even came to equal the difference of the game played in Malaga 66-48, 27 minutes, which shook the leadership of the group.
Unicaja was trying to overcome the absences and the last loss of Scottish center Robert Archibald, injured during the match.
Despite all the setbacks, Unicaja by Cook's direction and triples, and Lewis' contribution, left some hope 66-57, minute 31.
But it was practically impossible because Olympiacos when pressed and given its superiority in centimeters within the area was unstoppable.
The Croatian center Nikola Vujcic, managed to retrace the basketball average 81-62, 37 minutes, and Unicaja went out, handing the lead to Olympiacos.
How much should you charge for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they deserve according to their profile, thanks to a new application of Trovit, the search engine with the highest number of classified ads of real estate, employment and motor in Spain.
The How much should you charge? tool calculates the salaries of users from the more than 140,000 job offers available to Trovit in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where they must enter their profession, years of experience, age and city where they want to work.
In the week that the application has been in operation, the search engine has detected that in general the Spanish worker "feels poorly paid," explained in a statement the head of product Trovit, Albert Ribera.
According to the data available to Trovit from its search engines in the United Kingdom and France, Spaniards are the lowest paid.
A British computer programmer charges 45,226 euros gross per year and a French one, 31,059, compared to the 24,000 that a Spanish one receives.
In the same way, a driver charges 34,247 euros net per year in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the lowest-paid job in Spain is that of a waiter, with 11,592 euros net per year; followed by that of a dependent, with 14,725 euros; and that of an operator, with 15,667 euros.
The most searched jobs in the network in the last three months are the driver, part-time jobs and social worker.
Brazil sets date for Zelaya's departure
The Brazilian government has put a time limit on Manuel Zelaya’s stay at its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed president must leave the diplomatic legation no later than January 27, 2010, when his term would officially end.
Francisco Catunda, charge d'affaires of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he must leave before that date from the embassy, where he remains a refugee since September 21.
“He is aware that he has to leave on January 27, at the end of his term, he has to look for another destination.”
The station also quoted the former president, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the established deadline: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the government of Brazil," Zelaya said by telephone.
After the November 29 elections (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
This week, however, he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation was ultimately frustrated by Zelaya's rejection of the status of political asylee that the "de facto" government of Roberto Micheletti intended to impose on him.
Thank you very much
After the days of wine and roses since last spring in which asset inflation has been the dominant theme in the markets, uncertainty again reappears in the markets, which should not be surprising since it is its natural state, in an environment in which agents make decisions about the future by nature uncertain.
The medicine used by central banks to stabilize markets was to monetize debt by directly buying assets and indirectly giving liquidity free reign at near-zero rates for financial institutions to buy assets to discount.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases are all but over and, without questioning their unorthodox liquidity policy, they are starting to throw some sand in the gears like the ECB did with its year-to-year auction next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the global economy to sustain the economic recovery without such heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reversal of the reduction of risk premiums.
Stock market volatility and corporate bond spreads have picked up again, although they remain far from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialize private risk and public debt is again affected.
Again there is a flight to quality and the USA, Japan and Germany have been the refuge chosen by investors, causing a widening of the differentials of the countries of the eurozone with respect to Germany.
Spain had hardly been affected by this episode of instability but in that came Standard & Poor's and threatened a further downward revision of the rating of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty does not go wrong to silence moral hazard advocates who were again trying to create a charge of conscience on those responsible for world economic policy for having curbed the destructive effects of the credit restriction on the destruction of employment, when what would have to be done is to decree a new Thanksgiving.
However, what Dubai paints as a tribal struggle between the emirs to recompose power in the emirates and what Greece we have seen before.
A government that hides public deficits, elections and a new government that pulls the rug out.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Dur<0xC3><0xA3>o Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from a default on its external payments at the beginning of the year and to allow a euro member country to default on its commitments.
What makes sense is that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and make its citizens co-responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expect, we find ourselves in an episode of normalization of transitory risk premiums, after some excesses in leveraged positions, it would be within the expected.
In the case of Spain, while our public debt spreads widen like European corporate bonds, we should not worry.
If the European spreads decrease and ours continue to widen, then it would be a Spanish idiosyncratic risk.
Standard & Poor's is an anecdote. When our advanced indicators are forcing most educational services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and to revise upwards their scenario for 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, that they return to the burden with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy does not bode well for their warning.
Again, it looks like it will be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although for the moment "caution, driver friend".

The president of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene yesterday before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies in which the energy strategy of Spain in the next two decades is debated these days.
After his speech, which was followed by that of the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press a few brushstrokes of what he had raised in the subcommission behind closed doors.
For the president of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50 billion euros until 2020 and another 60 billion between that date and 2030, provided that the nuclear power plants are kept open today in operation.
If not, the necessary investments will not be 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
Of course, Iberdrola believes that in the next decade investments should not be aimed at increasing capacity in generation, but in distribution networks and international interconnections.
From 2020, the issue changes and we will have to increase the power.
Its focus is on both gas and coal plants with carbon dioxide capture mechanisms and, above all, renewable energies.
In this case, it considers that 18,000 MW are needed, yes, with other "support energies".
Galán, who considers that the bill of Sustainable Economy that the Government has just approved is in line with what his company has been claiming, did not want to make blood with the royal decree to encourage the consumption of national coal, which contradicts the policies of fight against climate change.
In his opinion, there is "a clear long-term commitment" in this sense, despite the "punctual" measures, as the president of Iberdrola called them.
Be that as it may, Galán believes that investment decisions, although they are long-term, must begin to be taken because they take time to mature and a stable remuneration framework is necessary to address them.
Ferrovial wins the Aer Lingus 'handling' in ten airports
Ferrovial’s subsidiary for airport services on the ground, Swissport, will play the role of preferred partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for cargo services in ten European airports where it has a presence.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are some of the highlights.
The agreement, of which the economic terms have not transcended, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a collaboration protocol to create the Center for Innovation of Intelligent Infrastructures
The alliance contemplates an investment of 20 million until 2012, of which 50% corresponds to Ferrovial.
One of the center’s tasks will be to investigate energy efficiency on highways and airports.
Acciona disputes its first motorway in Australia with Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first concession motorway in Australia, a market in which it already works as an energy company and water manager.
The work at stake is that of a tunnel valued at 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about 1.047 million euros).
The French Bouygues and the sister Hochtief are his rivals.
A five-kilometer tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane on the east coast has become the closest option for ACCIONA to settle in the country as a construction company and motorway concessionaire.
The City Council wants to have it ready by the end of 2014
After opting for public-private collaboration (PPP) to carry out the project, in a business plan overseen by Ernst & Young, the Administration already has a final list of candidates to take over the work and exploit the toll.
Pending the presentation of their offers next May, the planned investment amounts to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1,047 million euros) and in the last phase three consortia with a notable presence of European construction companies compete.
The group baptized as Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish in the league, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian construction companies, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists in underground works.
The Northern Direct consortium plays against the Acciona team, with the presence of the British Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium that has passed the screening is the so-called LBRJV, where the Australian Leighton (subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, in turn owned by ACS), the also local Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the gala firm specialized in civil works Razel share capital.
The Australian infrastructure market promises major works and privatisations, but carries with it a clear difficulty of entry if not through the acquisition of a local construction firm.
A strategy that has been followed by the aforementioned Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and which continues to be a pending subject for the Spanish giants of the sector.
Just ACS has achieved a position in that market through its 30% stake in Hochtief, owner of the aforementioned Leighton.
Assets of millions
Acciona is committed to a geographical area of the utmost importance for the sector, in which it already has an outstanding presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination business.
Among other assets, it has its largest wind farm, Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the group of companies in charge of raising and managing the Adelaide desalination plant, with a budget of 700 million.
Its intention now is to consolidate those two areas and take advantage of synergies to enter the fields of construction and operation of infrastructures.
The underground toll road, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and called the Northern Link, is intended to link the western Toowong Highway with the ring road at Kelvin Grove (see map) along 5 kilometres of tunnel. This is the largest action to reduce congestion in Brisbane traffic.
The calendar set by the Administration sets the award for the summer of 2010 and the start of the works in December of next year.
Although this payment step would open to traffic in the last months of 2014, it is not expected that the work will be completed until 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include two lanes per direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland Government will contribute A$500 million (€308 million) to its funding.
Brisbane offers business to Hochtief
Australia continues to bear remarkable fruits to Hochtief, who yesterday communicated the obtaining of a contract with the Government valued at 154 million.
The ACS subsidiary will enable, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the infrastructure of the national broadband network with fiber optic cable.
This action will offer fast internet access to 400,000 people and will give work to the German for 18 months.
In addition, the company has transferred the construction project of the King George Tower, 27 floors, in the Australian city of Brisbane. The works were still to begin and Hochtief has closed the sale in 129 million.
Already in the United Kingdom, specifically in Manchester, he will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and operation of two schools for 25 years.
The initial investment will be 75 million euros.
FCC wins 64 million tunnel in Slovenia
FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, has been awarded the construction of a 2.1-kilometer-long tunnel for a Slovenian motorway in the amount of 64.5 million euros.
The firm gets this contract days after taking over the expansion works of the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) for 130 million.
In this way, Alpine reinforces its expertise in tunnel construction.
The start of the works is scheduled for early 2010 and its execution period will be extended for 32 months.
Ms. Rushmore Awarded Renfe Advertising
Renfe has awarded the advertising and marketing services for the next two years to the agency Mrs. Rushmore for an amount of approximately three million euros per year, the railway operator reported.
The contract includes the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Mrs. Rushmore has been chosen among the 16 agencies that submitted to the contest convened by Renfe of which four were finalists, including TBWA who was responsible for creativity in the last three years.
From now on, Ms. Rushmore will be in charge of the design and production of the campaigns.
France Telecom fined $63 million for curbing competition
The competition regulator in France has imposed a fine of 63 million euros on France Télécom for anti-competitive conduct in the Caribbean regions belonging to the country.
According to this institution, the operator limited competition in fixed and mobile telephony with the signing of exclusive agreements, pricing plans and loyalty programs to consumers outside of regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company has accumulated more than 560 million euros in fines since 1994 for hindering its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday, in fact, has been increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar infringements in the past and that, therefore, it is a repeat offender.
App Store
On the other hand, the mobile subsidiary of the French company has followed in the wake of other operators and has opened an application store on the internet, with the aim of increasing revenue that does not come from voice transmission.
In principle, the Orange app store will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It will have to wait until 2010 to reach other countries, such as Spain.
Playing the Champions League has reported 476.4 million to Madrid and Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a since its origin
The Champions League has become a source of revenue for clubs since it was born in 1992.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have added 476.4 million since then, making them the third and fifth club to have won the most money in the competition.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only provides glory. It is also one of the main sources of income for big clubs.
So much so, that the competition has distributed 5,362.5 million euros to the 105 teams (12 of them Spanish) that have participated in the event since the tournament was created in the 1992/1993 season, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and F. C. Barcelona have come out of this distribution well.
The white club has been the third in the continent that has pocketed more money for participating, and the only one, along with AC Milan, who has won the trophy three times.
The Catalan, the reigning champion and the last winner of the defunct European Cup in 1992, is fifth in the standings.
The list is led by Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that, in addition, billed more money for participating in the last Champions League.
And that, despite losing both to Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country that has achieved more money through the Champions League, despite having achieved more titles than any other (five, by the four of Italy, the three of England and the two of Germany).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complicated money-sharing procedure applied by UEFA.
For this exercise, the body chaired by Michel Platini plans to enter 1.090 million for the Champions League.
Of this money UEFA will dedicate 413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the previous qualifying round (including Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received 3.8 million just for being there, in addition to another 550,000 euros for each party they play.
There are also bonuses to win (800,000 euros) and draw (400,000 for each team). The eighth finalists will receive three million each; the eight fourth finalists, 3.3 million.
The last four will be pocketed 4 million each.
The champion will win 9 million, compared to the finalist’s 5.2 million.
Thus, in terms of fixed payments, a club will receive at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a, on the other hand, pocketed 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
But there are also variable payments, to which 337.8 million are allocated.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish is one of the main ones, and has four assigned places.
The previous year’s champion gets 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other part will be paid according to the number of games played in this year’s edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% of Sos
The Nueva Rumasa group yesterday cleared the details of the stock purchase offer with which it seeks to acquire a cap of between 25% and 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
A percentage that does not require you to launch a takeover bid (opa) for all securities.
Specifically, Nueva Rumasa offers 1.5025 euros per share that would be disbursed in 10 years and that would be paid with an interest for said postponement of 1% per year.
Yesterday Sos shares closed at 1.85 euros; therefore, the offer of Nueva Rumasa values the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real valuation of Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 directors.
The Jerez group gives a period of 15 days for shareholders to communicate their interest in selling securities.
The CNMV said it had not been informed of the offer, even though the Ruiz Mateos company said it had contacted the regulator.
If realized, the disbursement would reach 611.7 million when the capitalization of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure his management.
In an attempt to remain on the sidelines of possible takeover offers and the judicial ups and downs of its former executives, brothers Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s and Jaime Salazar, it announced the election of Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Luisa Jordá as director of internal audit.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a high position in the food company.
It is a newly created position that will depend directly on the president of the group.
And it is not without controversy, as the company is still immersed in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of more than 230 million from Sos to companies of the Salazar.
In fact, it cannot be ruled out that over the next few months Sos will unveil new diversions of funds.

New tools to test cars
In these days of storms and accidents, not only car workshops win.
Every day thousands of cars that have suffered a loss are towed to a workshop, where an expert must assess the damage suffered and what the cost of repair will be.
No claim is the same, and calculating parts costs and labor time can be a long and complicated task.
The cost of a repair of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including parts and labor, can take two or three hours.
Instead, with the support of the latest computer tools it would be a matter of minutes
That is why almost 100% of experts use this type of system.
Service providers and solutions for claims assessment and maintenance are dedicated to collecting the information supplied to them by manufacturers, and then elaborate it and offer it to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the American group Solera, is the leading firm; 80% of the valuations are made with its products.
The other firms that compete in the field of valuation tools and elaboration of information on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
The work with the data supplied by the manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, in Spain they work with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides them with the information in different formats.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, to the point that in the last five years more versions, variants and engines have been released than in the previous fifteen.
As soon as a new car comes on the market, these companies get to work.
It is a very arduous task, because you have to catalog each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle and enter its price.
In addition, each model is made a "smart" graphic image where you can "prick" different parts of tourism.
If it’s a massive window model, the job can be ready in a week if the process goes too fast.
If it is a minority car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of the cars that are marketed in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models have information about Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
As for the mobile fleet that circulates, they exceed 99%.
To carry out the work of documentation and the elaboration of the databases, Audatex has eight centers spread around the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them is specialized in specific brands.
The national headquarters is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanical experts) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million euros annually in developing these databases.
2.5 million pieces of data are included each month, and customers receive updates every other day.
The development of this enormous flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and offer various products.
The most frequent use is focused on repair and maintenance, but depending on which countries there are also tools for management of scrapping parts or to calculate the venal or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that informs about the value of used vehicles in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer it in our country, but in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex it is easy to get an idea of the type of support they can provide to professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, being the flagship product AudaPlus, the standard claim assessment solution, aimed at experts.
It includes cars, motorcycles and light or heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the paint scales.
This tool is paid according to use, for each valuation.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it little, a maximum of ten times a month.
Then each insurance company, which carries out thousands of appraisals, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it left the assembly line only with its frame number.
AudaGlass focuses on the moons of vehicles, and AudaSubastas is a service open to the professional sector on the internet that allows bidding for vehicles declared total loss.
Its statistics service is very useful to identify trends, perform geodemographic analysis or know the deviations by brands or models.
You can study, for example, how many models of a certain brand have passed through the workshop because of breakdowns or how many have suffered serious accidents in a certain period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
It markets, among others, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and also provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official times of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is an Einsa Group company founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of damage, breakdowns or maintenance of the automobile.
The Gt Appraisal Guide is your historical reference product in the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its turnover has grown at a rate of 20% per year in the last three years, and in 2008 they invoiced 10.8 million euros.
At the beginning of last year they began their internationalization process, with the installation of an office in Paris.
Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company’s sources, 62% of its business is generated in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38%, in North and South America. They work with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.
Solera Group’s worldwide turnover (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach $557 million, 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country the company will enter 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera group was worth $1 billion on the stock exchange, and now its shares are listed for a total value of $2.4 billion.
It has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange since 2007 and is included in the Standard & Poor's benchmark index.
Online auction of damaged cars
Last October the Solera group bought Autoonline, an online platform for the sale of cars such as motorcycles or special vehicles.
The operation involved a disbursement of 59.5 million euros for 85% of the company’s capital, which could be extended next year to the remaining 15%.
The objective of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing an immense international market.
This valuation and sales service is aimed exclusively at professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, workshops, scrappers and professional sellers who must register before starting operations.
This platform was created in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website currently has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 experts.
3,000 ads are managed daily and in the Spanish market about 100 new ads are included every day.
According to Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been decommissioned cannot be re-circulated, but certain parts that are not damaged can be used as spare parts.
Cars with historical value can be discharged even if they have been discharged after a long process.
Workshop budget in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the Audatex company guarantees that the user obtains a quote in just four steps: identify the vehicle, look for the spare part, create a quote and generate a quote.
Ease of use is an essential condition for these systems, especially to convince older professionals, who to a greater or lesser extent are usually more reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, which are 666 cars, 109 SUVs, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, to use it you need a computer with an internet connection.
Once the model to be repaired is identified by its frame number, an actual graphic image of the model in question appears, and then the necessary spare part is selected.
The user can include variables such as the price of labor, surcharges or discounts, and then can print the budget to deliver to the customer.
AudaTaller is not a valuation tool like AudaPlus, but rather a catalog of references.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop-oriented one does not include estimated labor times.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is 350 euros per year, which the client can finance.
Currently the company Audatex is working to make these images three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics see with very good eyes, since it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn it around to see the inner face.
