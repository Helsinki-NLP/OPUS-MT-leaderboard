A Republican strategy to hinder Obama’s re-election
Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to fight electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter a myth and claims that voter fraud is less prevalent in the United States than the number of people who die from lightning strikes.
In fact, Republican lawyers have found no more than 300 cases of voter fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will adversely affect the participation rate.
In that sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Contrary to what happens in Canada, the American states are responsible for the organization of federal elections in the United States.
And along the same lines a majority of American governments enacted, starting in 2009, new laws that made the registration or voting process difficult.
This phenomenon has spread after the November 2010 elections, which saw the increase of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills restricting the exercise of the right to vote were introduced in 41 states during 2011.
New election laws require voters to present an identity card with a photograph, in addition to proof of U.S. citizenship.
On the other hand, these laws reduce early voting periods, invalidate the right to register as a voter on the day of the vote and remove the right to vote from citizens with criminal records.
Prior to the 2006 election, no state required voters to present a photo ID.
The State of Indiana was the first to demand it.
The Supreme Court of the United States upheld the constitutionality of Indiana law in 2008.
That is why the Republican authorities were quick to extend this practice to other states.
In recent years, these authorities have supported bills in 34 states to force voters to present a photo ID.
It is important to note that, contrary to what happens in Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity document, such as a Social Security card.
In fact, 11 percent of American citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, do not have any photo ID issued by a government agency in their state.
On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 lack an identity document with these characteristics.
But often, obtaining the required identity document costs more than a hundred dollars.
As a result, the new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people on low incomes.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000 a year, 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 do not have a photo ID.
And there's more.
In many states, students, the voters who vote the most for Democratic candidates, cannot use the photo ID issued by their institution.
On the other hand, those same states authorize members of fishing or hunting clubs who usually vote for Republican parties to use the documents issued by those clubs.
Prior to 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first state to do so.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove they are U.S. citizens.
These measures clearly seek to limit the Hispanic vote.
It appears that two out of three Hispanic voters support the Democratic Party.
On the other hand, Republican lawmakers in 2011 supported certain laws that abolished voter registration on the same day as the polls in eight states.
In addition, they limited the right of individuals and groups to create a service to help voters who want to register.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns contributed to the registration of about 10 million citizens.
The measures taken since 2009 resulted in a drop in the voter registration rate in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers adopted laws in five other states that favored reducing the voting period in advance.
For example, in the 2008 elections in Florida, 33% of the voters who voted in advance were African-American, while the latter represented no more than 13% of the state’s voters.
In the case of Hispanics, the same thing happened.
These represent no more than 11% of voters, which is equivalent to 24% of citizens who vote in advance.
However, whites, who represent 76% of the electorate, do not represent more than 46% of citizens who vote in advance.
Of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters have fervently opposed the passage of laws restricting voter registration.
In this regard, Democratic governors have blocked several bills.
The U.S. Attorney’s Office stepped in to suspend the most controversial laws.
The damage could be limited in part.
For example, only 16 of 34 states adopted the law requiring the presentation of a photo ID.
However, it is undeniable that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan character of the laws that have been voted on, since it is clear that they are intended to influence the 2012 results in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that states that have adopted such laws account for 171 of the 270 votes needed in the electoral college to win the presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty whether these electoral-system-wide legislative changes will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential election.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will adversely affect the participation rate.
In this sense, the measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate Cancer Screening: Getting Tested or Not Getting Tested?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes presents erroneous results, with false negative results or even false positive results, after which it is decided to perform useless medical interventions.
It is more than enough reason to make men, already reluctant per se, doubt whether or not screening tests should be done.
To take the test or not?
We asked for advice from two experts.
The studies conducted in the United States found a high rate of infections among the sample groups, making it difficult to interpret these data and make firm recommendations.
For its part, the European study showed some difference in mortality between patients who had been screened and those who had not.
The study, with follow-up at 12 years, also showed that there is a 30 to 40% chance of metastasis if the screening test has not been performed.
I recommend, therefore, the test from the age of 50, or from the age of 40 if your father has suffered prostate cancer.
Men of African-American origin have a higher risk rate.
The key is to make a good decision once the cancer is detected.
There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are indolent.
It is truly necessary to make the patient understand the degree of risk of his cancer. He should be offered all possible options and not necessarily treat prostate cancers that do not threaten long-term life, in which case he should opt rather for active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not treated, as the cancer is not aggressive or life-threatening.
Instead, we suggest active surveillance of the disease and, if it progresses, offer treatment.
We are increasingly determining precise criteria for deciding who should and should not be treated.
I recommend taking the test anyway.
But it’s important to talk to your doctor to determine whether the test should be done or not.
Movember has created, in collaboration with the International Society of Urology, a tool that allows you to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe for preventing cancer.
Despite advances in research, adopting healthy lifestyle habits is still the best way to reduce your risk of getting the disease.
We estimate that if everyone ate well and moved enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
"If no one smoked, that rate would rise to at least 50 percent," said André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
Instead, we assessed that about 10% of cancers are hereditary.
Many others remain totally inexplicable.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Tobacco use is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for other types of cancer.
It greatly harms people’s health.
“Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,” spokesman André Beaulieu said.
A hopeful fact: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is halved.
The weight
Fat and obesity also favor the onset of the disease, according to the SCC.
They increase the risks of cancer of the breast, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"Research shows that regular lifelong physical activity protects against breast cancer," they add.
The Food
The body also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In large numbers, they increase the risk of colorectal cancer.
Charcuterie products should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat for smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"They can damage cells in the body and lead to the development of cancer," they explain.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin complexes and cancer.
At the moment, however, his research is inconclusive.
According to the SCC, studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While in one of them there was a decrease in the risks of prostate cancer, in another what was observed was, rather, an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been clearly determined.
On the other hand, M. Beaulieu stresses the importance of talking about each person’s concerns and family history with their doctor.
"Doing the screening test does not cause cancer."
The Higgs boson in detail
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson generated a great commotion last summer, and rightly so.
It is believed, in fact, that this boson is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.
And what is more, it is the particle whose existence the standard model predicted: our best or "least bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter, which has not yet been observed empirically.
But it is not entirely clear to physicists that it is Higgs.
We know without a doubt that a new particle exists and that it closely resembles the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, new data unveiled this week at a major physics conference in Kyoto seem to confirm that it is, although more data is still missing to be completely sure.
Anyway, we assume it's Higgs, since the chances of getting it wrong seem slim. We'll see what it's all about.
There is, in this great world, a widespread and inescapable law that implies that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
There’s no way to break that rule and don’t try too hard, because you’ll end up hurting yourself.
Although particle physics is a very complex world, it has been shown that there is also a law of these characteristics: the Pauli exclusion principle, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state"; a "state" that consists, roughly, of some of their characteristics.
Physicists classify particles into two categories.
On the one hand we find the good citizens called fermions, who wisely obey the principle of Pauli.
And then there are the bosons, a dirty bunch of anarchists who have no respect for anything, or at least not for this principle, which means they can be found in the same place and at the same time.
According to the Berkeley Labs website The Particle Adventure, which, by the way, is extraordinary, bosons are divided into two groups: the mesons, which we won't talk about here, and the "force particles," by which the great forces of nature propagate and with which the Higgs boson would be somehow related.
These bosons, it could be emphasized here, are not the exotic bugs we might believe.
In fact, if he manages to read this chronicle, it is thanks to an extraordinarily banal boson: the photon or "particle of light" that acts as a "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it “disorders” the electromagnetic field in that precise environment; a bit like when we throw a stone into a pond.
In this "disorder" is born an electromagnetic wave (of light, infrared, ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon; that is, one of the "force-carrying" bosons.
More stable field
The same thing happens with the Higgs boson, with the difference that it is another field, the Higgs field, which needs to be "disordered" for this boson to appear.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field. To activate it you need to reach extremely high energies, a bit like an icy pond in which only a thick rock could slide on the surface.
That’s why it takes an immense particle accelerator like CERN’s (the big hadron collider is a 27-km-circumference ring!) to reach such energy levels.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between the Higgs and mass.
In fact, not all particles or materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others do not: a piece of paper, for example, will never by itself stick to the door of a refrigerator.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have a mass, while the rest (like the photon, by the way), do not.
Now, what "can all these investigations contribute?", Mrs Plamondon asks.
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the Standard Model (SM), and also allows physicists to scrutinize the differences between the observations and predictions of the SM.
For their part, many fervently want them to meet, because the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" that covers certain holes in the model.
This, it must be said, still has enormous shortcomings, as it does not propose any explanation related to gravity (ups!) or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the matter in the Universe (another ups!).
But we haven’t found such differences at CERN so far.
Implications
The repercussions of such research on our day-to-day lives are hard to predict, but we don’t think we’re wrong to say that it won’t have any.
In the early 1960s, the pioneers of lasers in laboratories had absolutely no suspicion of the revolution their work would bring about.
They envisioned scientific applications, but nothing more.
In fact, as physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Laboratories, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed) in 1962, said, at first the laser was rather considered a "laboratory apparatus".
Just imagine...
And in addition, the applications can also come from all the instrumentation that surrounds the research.
For example, Willard Boyle himself developed a light-gatherer in 1969 in the course of his research into optics.
Although it was not at all his original intention, this pickup now serves as an "eye" for all the digital devices in the world, which earned him the Nobel Prize in physics in 2009.
This does not mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC necessarily want to transform our lives, but that we never know...
Palliative care. The best way to die...
In its Dying in Dignity Commission, Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate should resume soon while a bill is being prepared.
Now, within that essential domain, there is still much to be done.
Le Devoir tried to see him up close.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his Montérégie apartment.
The prostate cancer that was destroying him had given him a two-year respite.
“They had given me five years to live, but I’ve already been like this for seven years,” he says, lying in his bed in the Victor-Gadbois palliative care center in Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
“But it’s always a shock, we can’t be prepared for this,” he continues.
The disease has wreaked havoc on him: a huge weakness that prevents him from going to the bathroom alone and even eating on his own.
Sitting in front of an appetizing lunch, he resignedly accepts to be helped to eat.
Brave, he even smiles, talking to strangers who give him attention, bring him medicine and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
“My biggest wish is to be cured of diarrhea, it’s humiliating,” he confesses.
A few hours later, the team found a cure.
“In the course of our lives we learn that a man pees on his feet,” says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois center.
Going back to their childhood, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
“That depends on the person’s ability to accept that regression,” he says.
Because, in the opinion of most people who work in palliative care, the big moments take place at the very heart of that regression.
All patients entering the Victor-Gadbois Palliative Care Center have cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
In that state, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer offer “curative” care.
Ms. A., 89,’s greatest fear is to die “conscious and drowned.”
But the disease has made her discover her children.
“I have good children,” he adds.
“I have no more desires left in this life,” she says, before agreeing to have a mask put on to help her breathe.
And he expects, in the coming days, a last visit from his son who lives in Italy.
In Victor-Gadbois is offered, with a group of volunteers, body care and food aid.
They are palliative care that is given when nothing else can be done.
To help make his death more comfortable.
In Quebec we have a palliative care bed for every 11,700 inhabitants.
It is very little, since we know that we will all end up dying one day.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors at the center.
Whether at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The dying man is offered brandy or Pepsi mouthwashes, according to the lawsuit.
Diabetics are no longer in control of their sugar levels.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served a beer to Mr. X, who died in the course of the night.
This morning, his son finished his beer at the feet of the deceased.
“We help both patients and their loved ones,” says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
At the Victor-Gadbois centre, the days go by without ever being the same.
Beside a 94-year-old man savoring his last family reunion in the courtyard, well placed between his pillows while everyone drinks to his health, a 36-year-old tragically dies, surrounded by his parents, his wife and their two children, after having tried everything to survive.
“For the past six months, there have always been three to five beds occupied by people under the age of 45 with cancer,” Dr. Christiane Martel said.
53% of patients who are admitted to the Victor-Gadboisarrivent center come from home and 47% from the hospital.
Access to palliative care
77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient reaches the terminal phase of their life, whether at home, in the hospital or in a care facility.
And several agencies, such as the Victor-Gadbois Center and the Greater Montréal Home Palliative Care Society, specialize almost exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely this relative lack in health care in Quebec that makes many doctors specializing in palliative care fear the adoption of a law that regulates euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by eminences of palliative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has been circulating to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec’s health system is not competent enough to ensure that anyone is entitled to quality palliative care before euthanasia is accepted.
"Recently," he says, "I saw a patient spend 14 days in the ER suffering great pains without having done what was necessary to relieve her.
I fear that patients may wish to die just because they are not receiving the proper care.”
And at the same time, many oncologists are obstinate with their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognosis.
Hél<0xC3><0xA8>ne Richard’s hopes of survival were already at an all-time low when she left a grueling chemotherapy treatment.
“When I told my oncologist that I wanted to stop the treatment, she told me that she was very sorry that she wanted to stop fighting,” he says.
"However, she had told me there was nothing else to do!"
There is no almighty care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who request to die thank their caregivers for not attending to their demands once their pain has been relieved thanks to a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful when it comes to the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at home in Grand Montréal, patients do not respond to pain treatments in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors usually resort to palliative sedation, which serves to sleep the patient until the moment of his death, either sporadically or permanently.
We can’t pretend that we don’t understand that part of suffering.
Increasingly, the unrelieved disease is going to have the possibility of having that palliative sedation.
The sick who are not relieved all say the same thing: "I want to die."
But that doesn’t necessarily mean “I want euthanasia,” but “I want relief.”
This report has been made possible thanks to a journalism grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials of the road network, entrepreneurs of the BTP, fundraisers of political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia count, day after day, what they know of a formidable "system", of which the construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mafias are part.
An "industry" that was too expensive for Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It is curious how the system is pulverized once we have hunted the big media," jokes Jacques Duchesneau, deputy in Quebec and former head of the Montreal Police.
He led the scandal in 2011, which was made possible by a thorough investigation into embezzlement linked to highway contracts in Quebec, which then-Liberal Prime Minister Jean Charest had only agreed to delay.
The “Duchesneau report” established a direct link between industry, clandestine party funding and corruption among officials.
“Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, only the transport ministry would have saved a billion dollars in contracts,” containing some of its instincts to keep a proportional share.
The Charbonneau Commission "has already taken down two mayors", he adds, while hoping to be able to "demonstrate the existing stratagems behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, created in 2011, also applies with its team of government interveners, researchers and analysts.
This unit works in addition to the police of "Marteau squad", which, since 2009, have made the "sewer cartel" of Montreal moderate when inflating contracts.
In recent weeks, the unit has proceeded to file serial fraud and corruption charges against city officials such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of an outlying city.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his post as mayor of Laval, Quebec’s third city.
It is suspected that repeated bribes have been pocketed in exchange for public contracts.
Engineers from the Montreal road network and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, have been formally indicted.
The latter has caused a commotion by explaining to the commission the mechanics of the "system" of obtaining public contracts.
He himself paid for three years 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary linked to the mafia who transferred the money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito distributed money right-handed and left-handed during the 2000s, awarding more than C$88,000 to provincial parties, especially the ruling Liberals.
He also admitted to organizing an illegal fundraiser for former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Inflation in the cost of sewerage contracts
In Montreal, the “system” of corruption worked effectively.
Gilles Surprenant, a former public works engineer, explained it perfectly to the commission: in ten years he received gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and bribes from construction companies for a total of 736,000 dollars, all in exchange for sewerage contracts whose costs he inflated.
Other highway officials have admitted that they received money for inflating bills by 30 to 40 percent for fake extras.
In addition, an organizer of the mayor’s party, Martin Dumont, accused M. Tremblay of deliberately turning a blind eye to a parallel budget and filling his coffers with dirty money.
In the wake of these revelations, M. Tremblay resigned in early November and led Montreal into a huge crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected politicians in Montreal to sound the alarm.
As mayor of the Rivi<0xC3><0xA8>re-des-Prairies district in the east of the island, she has opposed since 2010 the sale of municipal land acquired for $5 million and resold for $1.6 million to developers in the midst of a real estate boom.
70% of election campaign money was dirty money
Of the investigation that will finally be carried out, she says that she pulls "a thread to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop gangrene and catch the culprits."
He added that the process is “painful, but positive.”
We are cleaning the wounds but it would take a clean investigation unit in Montreal and be very alert so that dubious practices are not repeated.
How to do the cleaning.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, declares that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is uneasy above all about the role of the "elected politicians up to speed with the stratagem".
Estimating at 70% the proportion of dirty money that was allocated to the financing of electoral campaigns in Quebec, ironically: "I have been told that this is nothing more than a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to parties to $100, but that will not change the donation, according to him, "as long as election expenses are not strictly limited, there will be dirty money in politics."
He advocates a complete overhaul of the system for awarding public contracts and financing parties: "we cannot fall any lower; getting to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow us to rebuild the house with a stronger foundation, with more controls and laws."
If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, M. Duchesneau invites those who laugh to look in the mirror.
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season he has acquired a new entity with PSG.
How would you explain that advance?
It could be explained by an individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of PSG.
Great players have arrived.
I walk by his side day by day.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
And those elements push me every day to raise the level of my game.
In a game, that's easier.
Everything goes so fast in football.
But I don't get hot.
From my beginnings at the INF Clairefontaine pre-training centre to my time in Saint-Etienne, I have always advanced by leaps and bounds.
He's going to profit from the competition recruited by Carlo Ancelotti.
This summer’s recruits are used to playing very high-level matches.
They know that every workout is crucial.
That makes a player like me want to fight and give everything.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in terms of my positioning.
He's backed by adjuncts like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man the team needed?
Of course you do.
Ancelotti inspires respect in all technicians.
Today, there is no one like him in League 1 and he is among the best European coaches.
He has a great experience and has won numerous titles with the best clubs.
He has worked with great players.
I think he will take other titles in Paris.
In January I had a very comforting conversation with him.
I had just come out of a series of injuries.
The confidence he has in me also explains my good performance.
What do you think about PSG in the first half of the season?
In League 1, Lyon has taken away our position as leader.
We are still in the ambush.
One of our biggest goals is the Champions League: we have qualified for the round of 16 with style.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
We will try to get as far as possible.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we have a lot to say in front of many and very good European teams.
We want, to start, to finish first in our league against Porto to be able to receive the round of 16.
Can PSG become a great European club in the short term?
You already have the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris has to win titles and be there for the long term.
That is not the case today.
At the economic level, PSG is committed to its means to make this project a reality.
Not winning the cup in League 1, as in the last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, it would be a big disappointment.
This year we will invest all our efforts in taking that title of champions.
Last season we didn’t get very far.
In May we were disappointed, as we had the optimal conditions to finish first.
We had a strong season.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points we should have been champions...
But another team, Montpellier, had a much better season.
This year I think it will be the good one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux fight for the title, I think we have the weapons to take it.
Do you think the media expects more from PSG?
It is normal to expect a lot from us if we think about what has been invested in the players we have.
We have totally accepted it.
After we won 4-0 at home to Troyes, to still find things to reproach us with is a bit frustrating.
We wonder what else people are waiting for.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We are trying to start a game project.
A team is built with time.
In the Champions League we have shown that we can respond and be present.
Look at Manchester City who, after two seasons, have not managed to qualify for the round of 16, and they have also invested a lot!
In view of the sums reversed, we would imagine you with 15 points of advantage to the day.
That would be to neglect our adversaries and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well the previous season, have been "driven" by this new PSG.
That shows that League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we can say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we have ended up taking the trophy.
PSG seem totally dependent on the successes of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
We'd better say we have a Zlatan dependency.
That means Ibrahimovic is very competent and scores a lot of goals.
He's come to prove he's the star of League One.
And he’s proven in every team he’s been through that he’s a great player, a world star.
In the group we respect the man and the player.
And he also respects the men he has around him.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
That pushes others to increase their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows us all to progress.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with the French team?
It's been a disappointment.
I was very excited to participate in this tournament.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from accumulating playing time.
I saw things there and came out reinforced.
Today I managed to play good matches in the national team.
It's what I've been waiting for since my baptism with the blues.
We learned the lesson of what happened in Ukraine and it is because of that that we have exemplary behavior today.
What vision do you have of the first month of Didier Deschamps at the head of the "blues"?
He's getting results.
They are well placed in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The coach is rigorous, close to the players and inspires to win.
As was the case with Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make comparisons.
Blanc achieved his goal of qualifying for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the national team to Brazil.
Did the draw (1-1) on October 16 in Spain set the stage?
That game gave us confidence.
Each fought for all.
Before that shock in Spain, I had not lived a similar game in my entire career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
Quite the opposite to current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing burdens between the parties.
Moreover, as is often the case with technologies, the political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, composed of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency convertible to dollars, euros, etc. and a secure exchange protocol in the manner of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files from peer to peer.
Nearly 200,000 transactions have been recorded thanks to 15,000 computers in the network.
And about a thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a form of payment.
The price of bitcoin, having reached the top of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to 2 dollars five months later, before returning today to around ten dollars (quotations are censored on the page bitcoincharts.com).
It’s nothing impressive when compared to global changes in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) took an interest in it in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
In it, bitcoin was described as “the most successful virtual currency”, “competing with the dollar or the euro” and “similar to conventional currencies”.
Bitcoin differs from other systems with virtual currency types such as "credits", used to advance a video game and which can be won by playing or bought (and sometimes even redeemed).
The social network Facebook also developed this type of system.
But in every exchange a central authority controls and treats the changes.
With bitcoin, all network nodes are simultaneously custodians of ledgers, verifiers, currency issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Every transaction between two users is actually made between two electronic addresses in the form of e-mail.
A user can choose a different address for each payment, thus guaranteeing anonymity.
A set of information linked to this transaction is electronically signed through a double-key encryption system.
The network can then verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that bitcoin changes are recorded in the public ledger, which is disseminated throughout the network.
The key milestone is to write that new transaction in that book.
It goes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge thrown at computers and the winner, a kind of provisional central banker, will have the privilege of adding that complementary line.
This is a file chopping phase, that is, the transformation of a large file into a shorter and unique digital footprint.
Computers "take" the new transaction and add a number before "slicing" the set.
The goal is to find the number that offers a particular footprint (plus zeros at the beginning).
Once that number is found, the other nodes easily verify that it is the good one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the string of sets of the other transactions; any modification would change the footprint.
If, to commit fraud, a user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (in less than ten minutes), the network would only accept as valid one of the two transactions; the other would be orphaned, since both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solves the challenge takes 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, that reward is split in two regularly, likely before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is thus limited to 21 million, but they are divisible to the hundred millionth, which leaves a wide margin.
The difficulty of this challenge is also revealed in each increase in computing power.
The life of the network already has its ups and downs.
Websites offering services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins have been stolen on deposit.
“The flaw used does not affect the same protocol,” says Pierre Noizat, who just launched Paymium, a real-currency payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also takes into account the possibilities of money laundering thanks to this anonymous service.
But cash has the same flaw.
Big players like Wikipedia reject payments of this kind.
Others, such as the WordPress platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the ledger and showed that about 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November the "giant sales" were launched.
“They changed $30,000,” rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, author of a pedagogical book on this currency, strongly believes in the potential of this technology in addition to the network of transactions.
Their system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a contactless mobile payment, but uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which thus come out cheaper.
The bearer also manages its identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system is easy to implement in shops, which do not have to install new terminals or software.
All they have to do is provide an address that a phone can “photograph and recognize,” says Pierre Noizat, who claims to have thousands of users.
There is a general movement of revision of hierarchical systems by more horizontal systems.
“It will take a while for Bitcoin to prevail, but in 2013 there could be a change,” he predicts.
Moreover, in its report the ECB plans to reassess the various risks, now considered high, if this currency succeeds.
We're out of Afghanistan.
And then what?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans are due to leave by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without expecting anything from us.
We have punished above all the Afghan peasants, whom we have considered terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, plus the wounded and maimed.
The Taliban have foreign extremists and former refugee chiefs in Pakistan, but often also peasants who reject the presence of the foreign army, as in Soviet times.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if their causes are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks or Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes even helped by local insurgents, they will no longer be so when Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the Nijrab base, which I observed from the top of the almond-planted hills thanks to the French credits, was made by order.
Truck and tank convoys returned to Kabul unscathed, guarded by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban inflow into Kabul from the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since his irresistible breakthrough between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was then empty and the country engulfed in fire and blood because of the fighting between different factions.
Their takeover of the country had been perceived as a kind of liberation, the return to security.
Afghans have paid the price for the obscurantism of their peasants surpassed by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation is no better today.
The old mujahideen, the present government and the present Taliban share the desire to keep women in an inferior position.
The main personalities of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become speculators, taking government land to resell as plots for refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting along with huge US subcontracting contracts.
They are discredited; most of them have not fought.
The people, as I have heard in the countryside, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have known how to take advantage of American generosity: the flight of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They have lived through the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan and have appreciated its advantages.
With about 65 per cent of its population under the age of 25, Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, state schools are filled with both girls and boys.
It will be necessary to give work to those young people who will not want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, is avid for mobile phones. Television and its Turkish leaflets depicting a modern world have huge admirers across the country.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who want to run the country be considered legitimate?
The former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already busy reconstituting the provincial militias, which will flee from the central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain decentralization in the image of Western nations. However, the United States has wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with a strong presidential power, removing the position of prime minister that existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, in particular on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country had been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and even earlier.
No industry has re-established its services, no reservoirs have been fixed, and major irrigation systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported and nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.
Priority is given to private initiative.
In a country ruined by 30 years of war, government control would have been necessary.
Rumors spread that Afghanistan possessed immense mineral wealth.
And that only increased the feeling that Westerners were there to seize them.
Without energy to extract the iron or copper ores from the ground and without means of transport to export them through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have already almost abandoned the Mes Aynak copper mines, leaving international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) to excavate the immense buddhic site and remain there as the province’s most important employers.
Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports largely depend, will also need to restore normal relations.
French troops left on November 20.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls' schools, boys' schools, a French department at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, health and agricultural fields and support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in order to try to "win hearts and minds" and to carry out the impossible task of making aid and offensive actions coincide, a service of "civil and military actions" of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), suppressed in 2012, brought and had brought through a small French NGO numerous works of collective interest and agricultural rehabilitation actions in dozens of mountain localities.
Those jobs, greedy of obtaining local labor, have been able to help contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, sun protection and increase of cultivation areas.
What will we leave as a souvenir after two million euros of military spending?
A rather modest budget will contribute to the improvement of local, very harsh living conditions in those valleys often more than 2,000 metres high.
The Embassy received dozens of written demands with small agricultural proposals made by local communities in Kapisa province.
In order for them to free themselves from the insurrection carried out by foreign groups, something that the farmers have told me they want, it would be necessary to maintain a small, well-controlled civilian aid that reaches them directly.
A constitution with forceps in Egypt
It is a new double or nothing from President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever about the constitutional declaration, which provisionally grants him full powers, he decided to play the whole for the whole.
It caught everyone by surprise on Wednesday, when it announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the next day.
Just one week ago, the Head of State had given the Assembly two more months to complete its work.
And for almost two years Egypt has been using a provisional text, several times modified, which weakens institutional stability and leads to judicial entanglements.
This new initiative has only increased the fracture in the country.
For his opponents, the president perseveres in his “autocratic delirium” and continues “betraying his word” and “trampling on the law.”
Supporters say it is a move to end the institutional and political crisis faster and speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held in the next 15 days.
A very short period of time that forces the Brothers to give up their project of explaining the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the president, it is also a way to regain popular and democratic legitimacy while the controversy wreaks havoc throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in his favor, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Considering that this resource has been voted on very quickly, it contains an ultimatum for the Egyptian people: "either vote on my text or I keep the full powers", powers that will supposedly come to an end with the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in that strange environment that 85 members of this largely Islamist Constituent Assembly voted on the text yesterday.
Most liberals did not attend the meeting.
In mid-November, a little before the constitutional declaration, they had closed the door because they felt that they could not assert their views.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society did the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 substitute members were added in a hurry yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
As expected, the articles voted on unanimously.
The commentators are amused, on the other hand, by the fact that one of the few discrepancies of the day has been expressed practically at the time of prayer, so much so that several members of the committee came to think that the clock of the Constituent Assembly was wrong.
The text, which was still being voted on yesterday afternoon, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, the subject of all eyes, remains ultimately identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, which stipulated that “the principles of Sharia constitute the principal source of law”.
Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental demand, hoped that “principles” could be replaced by “norms”, which would have allowed for stricter enforcement.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a guarantee of their goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
Liberals call it hypocrisy and consider it nothing more than an advertising ploy.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They refer, in particular, to article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular for anyone who has to confirm its conformity with the laws of Sharia.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing because "the people called to speak are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here we glimpse the premises of a theocracy.”
The liberals’ fears are further heightened by the fact that the next rector of that university would be much less moderate than the current one.
“For now, there is no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution we are in the framework of the civil status.
Most of the jurists who have worked on that text are not ulemas but university students, some of them trained in the French system,” explains Alexis Blouet, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that there may be some ambiguity around Article 220, as the terms used mimic the religious vocabulary.
"We are referring specifically to the term iqh [Islamic jurisprudence, ed.].
And the question that might arise in the future would be to what extent are the civil judges competent to rule above all this.”
Beyond its religious character, the text voted yesterday has received many criticisms that refer to the extended powers it confers on the president of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood will claim that they are few in comparison to those who were during the previous regime.
Another point of contention: the powers vested in the army.
According to the wish of the military, the revision of the defense budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a national defense council.
Nor will the prosecution of civilians in military courts, as requested by associations for the defense of human rights, be prohibited.
They also expressed their concerns about the text, which they consider to be a liberticide.
The crime of blasphemy remains and, from now on, insults are prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially that of the press.
In addition, no articles emphasize the protection of women, Human Rights Watch’s Heba Morayef said.
According to her, the only positive thing has been the prohibition of torture under article 36.
The word did not appear in the previous Constitution.
Although the Egyptian president was supposed to go out last night on television, demonstrations are planned for this noon.
Supporters of the head of state demonstrated on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for the holy land, the navel of the world and a sea of brine
The Promised Land combines the majesty of biblical truths with modern comfort and pristine nature.
"AIF" identified the five most important reasons for visiting Israel.
Reverence in the Holy Land
It is worth visiting the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that anyone who enters this "baptismal pile" will receive divine grace.
And Galilee, the place of the miracles of Jesus: the conversion of water into wine at the wedding, walking on the waters, the appeasement of the storm and the full nets.
In this very place, Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
But the greatest number of holy places are found in Jerusalem.
Believers here walk the Via Crucis or Way of the Cross of Jesus (Latin "V<0xC3><0xAD>a Dolorosa").
It begins at the Fortress of Antony, the Praetorium, where the trial took place, and continues through the streets of the Old City, going to the Holy Sepulchre on Mount Golgotha, the place of crucifixion, to the Anointing Stone and the burial place of Jesus.
In this same place is also the symbolic Christian navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of humanity.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem, built on the place where, according to a Christian legend, there was a tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem there is also the most sacred place for the Jews, the Western Wall; the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
As is tradition, people of different religions leave here notes with their wishes, which will then come true.
Take a vertical trip
The ruins of the Masada Fortress was what was left of a secret refuge against enemies, which Herod the Great had built in 25 BC for his family.
They are located on the mountain cliffs at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
And to get there by their own means, can only those who are dedicated to climbing.
Others can reach this historic summit on the funicular.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m is the famous Hermon ski resort, where in the winter months there is a large influx of tourists.
There, from the foot of the hill bus services are offered.
The total length of the ski slopes is 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, on the top of the mountain supposedly inhabited pagan gods.
Visiting unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
In one trip you won’t be able to visit them all.
But it is worth visiting at least five of them, the most interesting.
Among them is the Israel Museum, located near the Knesset (Israeli Parliament).
In it are preserved the ancient Dead Sea Scrolls or Qumran Scrolls, discovered in the caves of the Judean desert, and about 500,000 archaeological and anthropological pieces.
It is worth visiting the Museum of Art in Tel Aviv.
In his exhibition of paintings he has canvases by Impressionists and Expressionists such as Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall or Picasso.
In Acre you can visit the museum-bathroom Al Basha, which are some rooms of old Turkish baths with model figures of visitors and bathers of that time.
In Caesarea it is worth visiting the exclusive Ralli private museum, where you can admire the sculptures of Rodin and Dal<0xC3><0xAD>.
There are no tour guides or souvenir shops there.
Admission is free, and donations are categorically not accepted.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, shows one of the most dramatic pages in history.
The most tragic section is the Children’s Memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter it and you find yourself in absolute darkness.
The stars are shining.
And the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they lost their lives ring out.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health
The three main tourist areas of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of them there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanographic museums.
It is curious that in the Red Sea they bathe even in the winter months, since the water temperature does not fall below 21 degrees and the air warms up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and there they bathe all year round.
By the way, this sea, the most extraordinary in the world, is at the lowest point on the planet: 417 m below sea level.
The blue waters there are a brine that easily sustain even those who do not know how to swim.
The surrounding landscapes are truly beautiful.
People come here to pass courses of treatment with salt water, brine and healing muds and to fortify their health in cases of dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to put in order their broken nerves.
Touching the Mysteries of Antiquity
They are preserved in the old part of Tel Aviv, the citadel of Jaffa, on the Mediterranean coast.
The famous sea route linking Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia passed through it.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark and Perseus rescued the beautiful Andromeda with whom, in this very place, he led a long and happy life.
Tourists love to wander the narrow streets that bear the names of the signs of the Zodiac.
They say that if you touch the walls in the street of your "same" symbol, fortune will be favorable to you.
In Jaffa you can find newlywed couples who come from all over Israel, and even from other countries to photograph themselves.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can stroll through the Roman theater, "take" the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman procurators, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourists will remember
If you travel to Israel, do not worry if your English leaves much to be desired: in this country about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
The money for this trip is not recommended to take it in euros, but in dollars, which can be easily changed to shekels (currently 1-3$,8 shekels).
Urban transport is mainly composed of buses, but in Jerusalem there are fast trams and in Haifa there is the only metro line in the country, which consists of six stations and connects the Lower City with the Upper City.
Actually, it's from an underground funicular.
Travel on any type of public transport costs 6 shekels and for this price you can travel by transfer for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on Saturdays.
From Friday night until sunset on Saturday, markets and shops close and public transport disrupts their work.
But Sunday morning begins a new work week.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels only kosher food is served, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes in which milk and meat are combined.
There is a wide selection of dishes based on beef and lamb, soups and desserts prepared with coconut milk, the traditional Hebrew cream called hummus, a wide variety of sauces, falafel, which are balls of ground chickpeas, fruits and vegetables.
In the streets of Israeli cities you do not see stray dogs.
Instead, there are many well-fed cats that "walk to their liking" in imposing ways.
At night you can see them sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
purrs love crowded places and do not refuse treats.
Renting a car, depending on the brand, will cost from $37 (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
In addition to insurance, it comes out for $15 a day.
And the rent of a bicycle will go out for 15 shekels a day.
Tickets to the museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
Israel in numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
The majority of those who came to tour the country and rest were citizens of the US, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and Ukraine.
The Promised Land, from January to October 2012, was visited by 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, an amount that exceeds by 51% the same rate of 2010, before the cancellation of the visa regime on February 9, 2011.
‘The Great and Powerful’ Will Take You to Moscow: Immigrants Save for Language
While deputies and human rights defenders argue about the consequences that the law would bring on the mandatory examination, scammers have already appeared in the country who trade with "false" certificates.
Every year, 13 million migrant workers arrive in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asian countries: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to help their families who have stayed at home.
From December 1, a law comes into force, according to which every working immigrant must take an exam to check his knowledge of the Russian language.
For now, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service delivery sector, community service institutions, household services and retail trade.
However, over time, as promised in the Federal Immigration Service, exams will become mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, it will not be enough to take the examination of the language, but also that of Russian history and that of the foundations of legislation.
Knowledge of the language must be confirmed even to receive and renew the work permit.
The exception is citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
Persons who succeeded in obtaining their education certificates and diplomas before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 shall not be subject to this law.
Usefulness, fatality and defense of rights
The network of examination centres will operate under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, Peoples' Friendship University, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants will be able to take the tests in all cities, right now in Russia more than 160 such centers are open.
The initiative on the introduction of the examination was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Immigration Service.
But rights advocates, long before the law went into effect, often managed to ask the press this question: And what will this actually bring?
What changes will the mandatory knowledge of the language bring, both for Russians and for immigrants themselves?
In the first place, respond representatives of the Immigration Service, this will reduce the number of people who suffer "labour slavery".
Many people today talk about defending the rights of working immigrants, explains Victor Sebelev, head of the representation of the Russian Federal Immigration Service in Tajikistan.
The defense of your rights must begin before your departure.
Only an organized selection system will solve the problem of immigrant workers in 90% of cases.
The problems are those immigrants without profession, education, those who do not know the language or pass the medical control.
Without understanding the language, Sebelev says, the future immigrant will be doomed to find unscrupulous people who, under the guise of helping, put a “paid trip” into a creepy, narrow-minded brood, where he and dozens of others like him are consumed for months without food or documents, working 12 to 14 hours a day.
We received countless complaints from our immigrants.
“In their homeland they are promised one thing, but when they arrive they are deceived, they are deprived of their passports, they are not paid the promised salaries,” confirms the Head of the Directorate of Labour Immigration of the Immigration Service of Tajikistan, Tolib Sharipov.
Don't get mad, boss boy!
Meanwhile, however, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who wish to work in Russia recognize that they not only do not know the language of the country they intend to go to, but also write with difficulty in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much their fault but their own misfortune: few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to receive normal primary education.
This is because their families don’t even have anything to feed the children, let alone dress them, shoe them, and buy them what they need for school.
Arriving in adolescence, these guys venture to work at the first opportunity.
It is difficult, if you do not know the language, recognize them.
“One feels humiliated and inferior.”
However, when it comes to the language law, rights advocates point to an important point.
The exams will be held only for those immigrants whose status is legal.
If they do not have that status, there will be no examination and, consequently, no official work.
Meanwhile, the majority of migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or forbid passage to strangers"
Many visitors claim that receiving official status in our country is not so easy.
The cause is bureaucratic obstacles and the difficulties of the language itself.
In addition, legalization costs money: from twelve thousand to sixteen thousand rubles.
However, a false inscription can be made quickly and for only fifteen hundred rubles.
The employees of the Russian police know that we usually carry false documents, we are not registered and extortion cases appear.
"They ask us for a hundred or two rubles for cigarettes or tea," Tajik citizen Umed Hushkadamov told reporters.
"Come on, don't be stingy, buy a painting."
On the first day of the entry into force of the language law, it became clear that not only immigrant registration documents can be false.
Several "false" certificates of knowledge of the language have already been seized by officials of the Federal Immigration Service.
The forged documents had been printed on standard colour printers.
Of course, they came into the hands of the new owners not as a gift: each immigrant, wanting to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is two and a half times more expensive than the official examination procedure, which will cost the immigrant worker three thousand rubles.
The main task for the near future is to protect the system against corruption so that “diplomas” cannot be bought, government officials and rights advocates converge.
So far, the authorities can promise immigrant workers that they would not have been able to successfully pass the exam the first time more time to study the basic language course.
In addition, immigrants who do not speak Russian will be offered jobs that do not require active communication with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not take drastic measures against the illegal arms trade
The percentage of crimes committed with registered weapons is quite low
The Ministry of the Interior proposes to apply the law with greater rigidity in relation to the owners of weapons for civilian use.
This is the government’s reaction to the recent incidents: Squeezing shots during wedding celebrations in which luckily there were no victims, and the massacre initiated by the Moscow lawyer Dimitri Vinogradov, in which Squeezing seven people lost their lives.
Police want to ban the use and possession of traumatic weapons in public places and raise the minimum age for obtaining a license to carry weapons from 18 to 21.
This idea was supported by the head of the Duma committee on security and anti-corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that reforms in the law on the possession of weapons will be brought to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to counter this problem by applying the “hard-handed policy”.
An open letter has appeared on the net, whose authors, representatives of various social organizations of shooters, demand that such measures of "senseless rigor" be given up.
The percentage of vandalism using registered weapons is minimal, criminal lawyer Vasiliy Lésnikov told Russia’s BBC news service.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, during six months of 2012, 142 crimes were committed with the use of firearms registered in internal organs, compared to the total of 1168 crimes registered for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that stricter legislation in the civilian weapons sector will not be an inconvenience for the offender to turn to the black market.
Now, according to his words, in Moscow you can find any weapon at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior claims that the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officials
The black market in arms is supplied through various channels.
The main channels are years, says retired Colonel Victor Baranets, who for ten years worked in the Ministry of Education and the High Staff.
Screenshot of website accepting weapons orders
The first, "army or military vestige", i.e. weapons that were stolen during military actions in the Caucasus.
“The weapons were stolen by Russian officers and by the Caucasians themselves,” Baranets says.
The next type of "black weapon",the ones stolen by criminals and representatives of the security forces.
Baranets explains that this includes weapons stolen from police warehouses and those stolen directly by law enforcement officials.
Illegal weapons go on sale from military arsenals.
In many military arsenals there were often explosions.
“There are proven versions that some fires were deliberately set to cover the fault,” says a former military officer.
According to Baranets, the gun manufacturers also put their bit in.
“Now private arms factories have proliferated that are not competitive on the international market and distribute weapons under rope to the black market, including that of Moscow,” says the expert.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
A lot of guns and machine guns come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan.
"There they have their own production, sometimes handmade, and a mafia has formed that has organized the flow of weapons," explains the former military.
Where do the guns come from?
Experts have calculated what is the approximate share of each of these sources of illegal arms supply to the black market.
A report on this topic was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Public Management Planning.
The specialists analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminological bibliography and public access data from portals whose theme revolves around weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to investigators, come from the armed forces and security forces.
Half of the black market weapons have gotten there “because of officials whose work is related to weapons,” the report says.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from places where there are armed conflicts, 14% of the cases are stolen during the production of weapons and 5% correspond to "illegal archaeology".
The clerk of one of the gun shops, who asked that his last name not be mentioned, says that the weapons found by illegal excavators have not been bought by anyone for a long time because they are too old.
More often, he says, suppliers head to military warehouses when they need a match.
Through some ensign, the supplier buys a unit, for example a TT gun.
They remove it from the register and pass it over the fence.
“This one takes the gun to the city and sells it for 900 euros per unit with two chargers,” he tells us.
“But, of course, the police are aware of all the issues, so periodically, when the crime detection plan has to be fulfilled, they make trial purchases from illegal arms dealers,” the clerk adds.
"Like in a luxury boutique"
The seller and the buyer usually meet through acquaintances.
"I visited websites and blogs until a guy proposed to me to go to the platform 'Begovaya', where there would be a man who would take me to a 'esquinita' where we could negotiate.
About the price of the gun, I found out only there."
Military commentator Viktor Baranets
"To get a gun I need a friend who has contacts," says the shop clerk. "I have a friend like that, but I don't trust him very much."
There are vendors in the markets, but you also have to get there, let's say "from Mr. Ivanovih, who asked me to tell him that a tooth had fallen out on his daughter."
I can even get a pair of steel mittens through a trusted person.
He also supplies them only to me because he knows I'm not going to give him away.
Newbies look for weapons in different ways.
Former military man Viktor Baranets was put to the test as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
Schemes, in his words, have not changed.
He was given a photo album where there was "not everything".
“I felt like I was in a luxury boutique,” recalls the military man.
The buyer, in Baranet’s words, is not offered cat-for-hare: everything there is can be tested.
I, as a potential customer, not only buy; we go with the seller to the forest, where we put a target.
“They give me a chance to shoot and when I make sure the gun fires well, we start negotiating,” he said.
Sofa Shop
Web search engines lead to "Vkontakte" sites and groups, where it is offered to buy weapons "for different purposes".
For this, no documents or personal meetings are required.
"It is enough to have a certain amount of money," they write in the title of the ad "Buy a gun or a machine gun."
There users place their orders and ask questions.
And they sell to minors?
"Without permission, of course," asks the user "Iván" (spelling preserved).
"I buy pistol TT. Moscow", laconically asks his question "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and captures at two hands those who wish to buy firearms.
And people go, like hungry fish to the bait, and then, to extract coal in Siberia
military and ex-military commentator Viktor Baranets
I have heard about these systems: usually the website is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People do the ordering.
The buyer makes the payment through an ATM.
“In response, they send him a photo and instructions so he knows where the gun is hidden,” said Dmitri Kislov, press secretary of the right-to-arms NGO.
Viktor Baranets claims that if you place an order online, you run out of a gun and are thrown in jail.
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and captures at two hands those who wish to buy firearms.
“And people go, like hungry fish, to the bait, and then to extract coal in Siberia,” he says.
Makarov for 100 dollars
In the purchase of illegal firearms, according to experts, one can spend from 100 to 900 dollars.
According to Dmitri Kislov of the NGO "The right to arms", a Makarov pistol can be purchased for 100-300 dollars.
We have to wait a month and a half.
It is sent from military warehouses by middle-ranking chiefs.
According to official statistics of the ministry, compared to the period January-October 2011, the total number of such crimes in Russia decreased by 7%, which constitutes 22,900, and the number of identified cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
Employees at fast-food restaurants and supermarkets in the U.S. are on strike.
Up to a quarter of U.S. teens find their first jobs as cashiers at McDonald’s
In recent days, a wave of protests against the low wages paid in Walmart supermarkets and in restaurants of popular fast food chains, such as "McDonald's", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken" has begun in the United States.
For now, no one dares to say whether or not this wave will reach the nine points, or if it is destined to lose strength and soften in its early stages.
The protest actions have the support of the trade unions and a number of left-wing NGOs.
In addition to the rise in modest wages received by Walmart workers and those of the fast-food system, the goal of the organizers of the protests is the creation of labor unions in these companies.
For now, this sector of the economy has hardly been occupied by the trade union movement.
Forty-six cents a year?
The actions began last week, after Thanksgiving, the so-called "Black Friday". That day, in the United States began the orgy of sales that captured millions of inhabitants, and which was sometimes accompanied by clashes.
That day, some workers at the Walmart corporation, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, quit their jobs and formed protest pickets alongside unions and left-wing activists at the corporation’s stores, whose products target modest and moderate income earners.
Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products in their stores are on average between 8% and 27% cheaper than those of the largest supermarkets.
That’s why many low-paid Walmart workers shop only at work.
The availability and assortment of products have made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
In the words of two critics, Walmart can afford to sell products at very low prices, in part because it pays little to its workers.
The latter also complain about poor working conditions, such as the lack of forklifts or hand-held scanners.
That “Black Friday” the participants of the demonstration demanded the increase of wages and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation went from 30 to 100 dollars per month.
For a typical Walmart worker, who gets $9.5 an hour, this expense is excessive, they said.
Scientists at the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart raises the average wage to $12 an hour, it will cost the corporation $3.2 trillion.
This is about 1.1% more than you spend on wages now.
If Walmart places the wage increase on consumers’ shoulders, each visit to the store will cost them only 46 cents more.
In one year they will spend the ridiculous amount of $12.39 more than they spend now.
Walmart supporters are pleased to say that the protest took place in only nine states and did not cause any losses to the corporation.
“Black Friday” lasted in its stores from 8 p.m. on Thursday through midnight the next day, and during that time, Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, its cash registers made nearly 100 million transactions on “Black Friday.”
The company’s representative, Dan Fogelman, said in an interview with the left-leaning Huffington Post website that fewer than five Walmart employees left their jobs and that the protest had been just “another PR stunt” organized by the workers’ union.
"Free box!"
The protests continued this week in New York, in which the targets were not precisely the Walmart department stores (which in this progressive city do not appreciate them, and for that reason for now there are none), but the "McDonald's" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says it sells billions of portions, and then they don't even give you sick pay and they don't pay you for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, Member of the New York City Council
Currently, according to federal and New York law, the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants are increasing over time, but only slightly, and on average, ordinary workers in New York get $8.90 an hour.
No one earns less than them in this city.
How it is possible to survive in New York with that money, for me is something incomprehensible.
There was a time when nearly a quarter of American teenagers went through McDonald’s and worked there, behind counters, part-time after school, even though they still lived with their parents.
Few saw this as the main source of income or planned to stay there for long.
Now, I constantly stumble upon some interviews with McDonald’s workers who complain that they have to live off this salary, and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, in a forum of the Wall Street Journal there is a comment whose author points out that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know what to feed them.
Participants in the protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at McDonald’s on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and fast-food chefs start paying at least $15 an hour, or double their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that workers’ unions be created in the fast-food sector.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from impeding this right and punishing union activists with wits and firings.
On the other hand, administration rarely makes their lives easier.
But, for objective reasons, it is easy for unions to embrace the fast food sector.
One of the main reasons is the excessive turnover of staff.
Discordant
Loud protests took place that same day at other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the action took place midway through the rally at McDonald's near Times Square, which was attended by several local Democratic politicians, particularly City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said, "McDonald's says it's selling billions of portions, and then it doesn't even give you a hospital or pay you for your honest work."
The demonstrators received support from other prominent New York Democrats, for example from Mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio, who said that "we must support fast-food workers so that they can receive fair wages and the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves."
As the New York Times described it, this has been the largest demonstration of its kind in American fast food history.
But only a few hundred people participated, not even all of them employees of the fast food service, in which tens of thousands of people from New York worked.
It is not yet clear whether this will serve as a spark to provoke a mass movement.
"For now, fooling the brain is not so easy."
The topic of augmented reality, so popular among fans of modern technologies, is currently perceived normally mainly through the prism of special glasses.
In early summer, at its annual conference Google demonstrated a moving model and later, in November, it was learned that Microsoft had also filed an application to claim the corresponding patent.
However, from a conversation with the head of the 3D interactive technology group at Microsoft’s Cambridge lab, Izadi Sharamom, it was elucidated that for the scientists of that company, the glasses already belonged to a past stage.
They are attracted by the prospect of manipulation of virtual objects in the air with bare hands and the creation of open virtual spaces.
- Please, in general terms, what is the object of study of your research group?
- We are dedicated to human-computer interaction, but we also try to expand the limits of this interaction.
For now humanity in its great mass has been caught in the stage of working with the pixels of the flat screen, sometimes touching it with the finger.
But we want to look 5-10 years ahead and guess the cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors represent a step forward and today no Xbox is sold without Kinect, since everyone is interested in gesture control.
- What does the future hold?
Even though Kinect has taken the interaction to the physical level, much of it still occurs on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is still not very good.
We are trying to change this, we are working on truly three-dimensional visualization systems, based on different technologies, including design.
We must free the world from computer science to ours, to the physical, to make it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the space that surrounds him.
Then we can complete the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable way.
First of all, to hell with those silly virtual reality helmets!
What do you think about voice control?
A very popular detail, but don't you think they overestimate it?
- Of course it can not be considered a panacea, it remains pending to solve the issue of privacy, since you do not always want others to know about our actions and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but each in its own field.
For example, for controlling devices in public places, we had a project where we thought about gestures, but not loose movements, but shorter ones.
In addition, the gestures were captured not by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet that recorded the movement of bones and muscles.
For now it is very large, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But, in general, the future is for a combined type of control, for example gesture + voice.
- What's that like?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass you this soda can?
You will talk and show it at the same time.
- Normally I just talk.
- Oh, that's gonna be very hard to recognize.
- That is, you want to force users to adapt to what the machine can or can not do at this time?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual approach.
I think in the near future we’re going to have to work primarily on designing new types of sensors that can accurately determine a person’s reactions.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, as they provide good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- If we talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what complaints do you have about modern cameras?
Are you lacking resolution, depth, or something else?
- In principle, the current generation is what can be the beginning of our work with three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be nice to get 8 megapixels at the speed of 1000 fps.
But the question is not in the megapixels, but in the quality of the matrix and in the depth.
From this latter point of view, not all current technologies are good enough for us; this gives more work to algorithm designers.
That is, we have to remember not only the resolution on the X and Y axes, but also on Z.
Also important is the speed, the number of frames per second.
The human movements are quite dynamic and the current ones of 30 fps are really scarce, especially for the gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our laboratory in Redmond, made a contact sensor with adjustable processing delay of 1 to 100 ms and it is worth mentioning that the modern sensors produced in series are closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands to what extent this affects human-machine interaction.
For me it would be very useful for my work an equivalent of such a device, but that does not require contact so that the frames per second are more.
Do you need to increase the number of cameras?
The Kinect now has three “cameras,” one of which is in fact the infrared emitter and the second the reflected signal receiver.
But the third camera is actually a simple visible fingerboard sensor.
This is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially, more cameras could solve the problem...
Or on the contrary, increase it and increase the required amount of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible Kinect analogue, play with the curvature of the cameras’ location and see how this would help determine the three-dimensional position.
- As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not presented its glasses to the public.
Don’t you think that, from the point of view of the daily use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most visible platforms?
- Of course, spending all the time holding up a smartphone in your hands, is not very comfortable, but I think: the best option would be a "transmutable" augmented reality when, based on a cloud platform, you could switch from glasses to the smartphone,
Glasses are very personal devices, that’s their strength (private things only you will be able to see them), but also their weakness: an augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark from the movie "Iron Man", but also to any simple mortal.
There is a problem with this idea that critics often point out: there is no tactile response!
The hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my lectures I often say that augmented reality is the seventh irruption in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth might well be the addition of tactile sensations.
Meanwhile, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of the second hand in quality of support for the image.
Record the touch perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are truly geared towards bringing tangibility to these "air images." For example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays aimed at a specific point where the finger is located gives a similar feeling as if someone were blowing it on the fingertips, but that feeling is still very weak.
There are also wristbands that influence the nerve endings of the fingers, this also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to trick the brain?
Make him think he feels what he looks like he should feel the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried it yet.
Here is another challenge that we will have to struggle with for a long time, how to make a person physically located in a very small space believe that he goes to an open space, almost endless. We are also working on the idea of treadmills (not like those of gyms), mobile platforms, as well as that of giant balloons.
For now, deceiving the brain is not so easy, we still have to work for many years.
That’s what makes working with virtual reality attractive to researchers, who find many things in a state of total conception.
Subjective personal taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "Vanguardism of St. Petersburg", dedicated to the citizens who are in front, at the forefront of art and culture.
In this list of the best are brilliant figures of the art and scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements reach beyond the city: they often find recognition in Europe without Russia even knowing them.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city meets Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed in red from top to bottom, who can be found near the Russian Museum, near the Summer Garden or at fashion gatherings and inaugurations.
Kirill Miller’s paintings always draw crowds, wherever they are displayed.
Kirill Miller is one of those purely sociophilosophical storytellers from St. Petersburg, creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of the avant-garde of St. Petersburg of the late 80s - early 90s.
In addition, he is an urban man, whose appearance on the streets of the city awakens in the inhabitants smiles and raises everyone's mood.
Recently, he took in his hands an organ and became the organ maker of St. Petersburg, as he has matured to make such a difficult role, for his bohemian existence, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you going around the city dressed in red and not yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose the color red because I am a fashion designer and I am dedicated to appearance and image.
In this world, the color red is a compromise between the artist, image makers and society.
Although in society, everything that is not a little gray arouses aggression and agitation of properties not good.
But my provocations are aimed at getting a conversation started.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to debate.
When did you realize you had to be an artist?
- In an exhibition at the Nevsky Palace of Culture, where my works were exhibited.
I realized that this was my path.
Then the wave of old unofficial artists was over, and new ones, free like me, were still misunderstood.
I became friends with artists of the new wave, with the later ones being exhibited in Gaza and Nevskiy, which led to "Pushkinskaya-10", and the new wave is over.
I joined the theater for the clothes, the music of all genres, but not for the lyrics.
And all this came together in your art clinic... for me it was important to be in the cultural center of St. Petersburg, where the best creative minds were to be gathered.
In 1995, I occupied a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there were no reforms, there was a music art club, a bohemian club, the bohemian house of St. Petersburg.
Many were born there: Noms, Tequila Jazz, I remember the way Schnur brought "Van Gogh's Ear" to the project.
Schnur and his friends sang light songs under phonograms, wore tight pants, among them was the current fashion composer Igor Vdovin.
When the group started playing live, it became "Leningrado".
Trachtenberg was the animator of many programs before the time of Hali-galivskih.
We gave them to Trachtenberg and it was the beginning of his great career; basic education and training he received from us.
Gallery "D 137", the "Club Griboyedov", are the remains of the Art Clinic.
There were our employees and regular customers.
I'm a hero of the last century, when culture meant something.
In the year 2000, the survey was done in the press, the award was "The people of our city".
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" I was chosen, so ended my culmination.
In these new times it is not comfortable to work; I am a man who likes the truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In our times it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are separate. One can be popular but very uncultured.
- There's something recognizable about your work.
- Many of my paintings are hits, in them the actuality and the occurrence are clearly expressed.
I'm going to do a scheduled exhibition, "The Russian Museum in Clowns."
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be sociable, but now being so is painful and scary.
But in the clowns everything is muddled and the tragedy is eliminated.
I love the grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world through a totalitarian and compulsory change of clothes.
Now one is followed by clothing, oriented outwardly, but not inwardly.
And, perhaps that person should not even shake his hand, but spit in his face.
And deception will be eliminated when changing clothes.
- We recently saw you in the role of urban organizer. - A cultured city must have such a hero.
Who better than me to be!
- Fine but, maybe commercial art can be beautiful?
- Now commercial art must be scrupulous, sweet, tactful.
We are witnessing the disintegration of cultures.
Before people were grouped in herds, the Bohemians wanted one thing, the simpletons another.
Now everyone has split into micro-communities, it’s hard to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar bill to please everyone.
Now you have to think about who you want to like.
Now, each cult hero has his 100 fans.
- And to hear Stas Mikhailov arrive by the thousands!
- The abandoned ones will see it, there the sex-social sphere works.
And at a cultural event 300 people go, 10,000 will never come. As a result, less management, less money, everything withers.
I have my fans, the most important thing is not to deceive them, not to spoil what you have achieved.
When I was young I made such paintings that a collector had them hanging on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings, which people usually end up with.
Now they often confuse the concepts.
They say spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There is no culture of consumption, that’s another story.
I am a man of the culture of yesterday, I grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, they refused money just to paint pictures.
I am in favor of this culture.
- Kirill, what is St. Petersburg missing?
- Good experts in culture.
There is a concept: an official of culture.
But not all of them can devote themselves to culture.
When kings were right everything was different, kings might not understand the culture very well, but they knew that it was necessary to keep the right experts.
In Moscow there are now very good consultants.
We have people in St. Petersburg who might well be experts, but they are closed, because experts at a higher level are needed to properly evaluate them and pave the way for them.
Subjective personal taste is now thriving.
The same Erarta, but the difference is that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to look for other museums.
- What's St. Petersburg to you?
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital. In Moscow there is much more culture, there is land.
But on our stones it is difficult for art to grow.
We need cultural terrain and now we have more writers than readers, this is wrong.
In Europe there are a lot of people with curiosity who go to exhibitions and concerts.
In our case, this class is tiny.
We have to make art fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project will be implemented with a grant from St. Petersburg.
Giving birth in space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with humans on board set out in search of a spare planet.
In order to preserve humanity, the main question is asked: How to continue the species in conditions of weightlessness or on the same spare planet?
I think there's little to choose from.
In fact, only two are true planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically.
"These are Venus and Mars," says Sternberg P.K. (IAES) State Astronomical Institute chief researcher Vladimir Surdin.
But if conditions on Mars are better for life, on the surface of Venus the temperature is 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
The problems of reproduction in space with the flora began to be addressed.
Experiments with plants have been carried out for half a century.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit differed in no way from terrestrial varieties.
Then came the breeding of insects in the orbit, small fruit flies, drosophila.
In 1979 quail eggs were sent into space to check how the embryo develops under weightless conditions.
We get a normal chick as a result.
But then the problems begin.
"The problem is that this chick has to find support, it has to stand on its own feet and start moving," explains Vladimir Sychev, the director of the laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IPBM) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
Finding no support, the chicks flipped randomly.
And after 10 hours in newborns there was a total atrophy of instincts.
The chicks did not react to light or sound.
And the misfortune was that after four days they simply died.
"And twice we got the chicks born, but then we left because it was impossible to work there with them," comments Vladimir Sychev about the failure of the experiment with chicks in space.
The last time a biological miniarche flew into orbit was 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013 the experiments will continue.
However, in the biosatellite "Bion" only species of the same sex will travel.
There was an experiment with rats, which were sent into space already with fetuses.
In principle, nothing supernatural was found.
"This was precisely in biosatellites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies like this must be carried out," comments Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats had offspring.
However, it has not yet been possible to address the problem of reproduction directly in space.
It's a tough challenge.
Animals, losing their usual habitat, simply cannot realize their sexual instinct.
Man, however, unlike small animals, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens has abstract reasoning and is able to create an appropriate emotional background.
Similar experiments are not conducted for ethical reasons.
Women have been in space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was Tereshkova.
And the most precious thing that humanity has is the female organism.
Our seagull flying, and no one on Earth could say: if it is after a flight to space.
You may or may not have a baby after this flight.
“After all, no one has answered this question,” comments aerospace veteran Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, just one year after the flight to space, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The girl’s father, Andrian Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second female cosmonaut, Svetlana Savitskaya, who twice was in orbit and even worked in open space, had a son.
However, the risk persists.
We are few, are counted the astronauts to whom after long flights everything has turned out well, and a healthy generation comes growing.
"And if you can say more, it is dangerous even in orbital flights," sums up the cosmonaut pilot, hero of the Soviet Union, hero of Russia, Valery Polyakov.
However, humanity must look for some new avenues in biotechnology, in radiological protection, in the creation of artificial gravity.
The Hydrolab of the Cosmonaut Preparation Center is a mandatory stage in preparation for flight.
In conditions of zero buoyancy, cosmonauts practice their work skills in space.
Water simulates weightlessness.
If for an adult water is a comfortable environment, although still hostile, for a newborn child it is his natal element.
The small amphibian-men seem to confirm that life on earth arose from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is about 9 months inside his mother in the amniotic fluid, because it will be easier for him to get used to water later.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth to the moment of the first bath only 2 weeks pass.
“This is too little to forget something,” says Marina Aksenova, a newborn swimming monitor.
In short, if weightlessness is a more natural state for a newborn, for women gravitation, the force of gravity, is necessary.
In weightlessness the abdominal and pelvic muscles decrepit very quickly, the ability to expel the fetus is reduced.
Well, we omitted that, relying on the action of stimulants for childbirth.
You can, of course, give birth in a special chamber, this will push it.
"And then what?", Valeri Polyakov asks himself this original question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the sensation of gravity, the body does not generate the skeleton or the muscular system.
A newborn in orbit is impossible to dress him in a special suit for training, as adults.
He will simply be deprived of what is vital to him.
“And this experiment that we are going to do together, by allowing the birth of a child in a strange environment, will result in us bringing to Earth a disabled, a totally maladaptive person,” predicts the head of the bioethics committee of the Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical question.
However, over time this will become a reality, as humans on their ships head to a distant planet that will be home for their space-born children.
Head of NK<0xC3><0x9A>: Inspection of the system "<0xC5><0xA1>varc" has not found the guilty politician
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and quality legislation, although implementation is lagging behind.
This is stated by Miloslav Kala, vice-president of the Office of Supreme Control (NK<0xC3><0x9A>) in an interview for Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
"The law will never be perfect", but its application must be correct. "This is, in my opinion, what we lack", thus describes the current situation.
Joint inspections by Czech and German inspectors also reach similar conclusions.
As an example of a wrong practice, he mentions Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as' attitude towards the system of being autonomous only on paper, which is known as the "<0xC5><0xA1>varc" system.
The prime minister recently said that the ODS (Civic Democratic Party) would not bother businessmen with inspectors. So is it forbidden or allowed?
"The law must be regulated in some way and if it prohibits something, in that case, neither the president of the government can prevent the action of the office that has the obligation to carry out such controls or demand obligations," Kala said.
At the meeting of the Control Committee in the Congress of Deputies, you spoke about the joint project between the Czech and German teams, in the framework of which the legislation concerning public awards in both countries was compared.
What exactly is it?
This is a parallel check that we started about two years ago.
Put simply: European legislation regulates how public awards are to be organised, this is followed by the legislation in force in each country and then by the practice itself.
We have put everything together and, although the control has not yet finished, we have obtained very interesting differences. Generally, the legislation of our country is "stricter and more complete", however, the concrete praxis in some parameters is better in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to incorporate increasingly strict rules, but that it is necessary to concentrate on the application of the law itself.
What can this project actually bring? What do you think are the conclusions?
It is precisely such a common control that could help us to stop investing efforts in the implementation of laws, the reduction and improvement of limits, even if this does not have such a positive impact.
Savings economics means getting a suitable thing at a reasonable price (which does not always mean that the price is the lowest) to avoid enrichment and, in the long run, criminal actions.
But not by reducing the limit of the awards means that we are going to get it.
Perhaps because the system is saturated with so much “paperwork,” those who want to look for flaws in the system will be able to do so more easily than if the boundaries remained as high as they are now.
You talk about the problems of our country with the transfer of the legislation that regulates the practice of public awards.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is it an office similar to our NK<0xC3><0x9A> or is it organized in another way?
As for the offices, such as the NK<0xC3><0x9A>, where the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court of Accounts) operates, with an organization similar to ours, with a college too, the only thing is that in its case it is structured in a somewhat different way, but in principle both offices evolve in parallel.
The competences are also somewhat analogous, however, as far as Germany has a federal organisation, the courts of auditors are even at this level. In this respect it differs slightly from our system.
The Federal Court of Auditors (FCA) can only control federal money, which here we call state funds.
Public funds, which are administered by the regions and municipalities, there, in Germany, are controlled in the Federal Court of Auditors.
In terms of local legislation, is it simpler than ours?
In general, I would not like to make a comparison without concrete data. However, Germany remains a model in some respects, but it is not possible to specify exactly what is better.
Could it be better, for example, in terms of the quality of inspectors?
I'm sure not, but, I repeat, I don't like to make such comparisons.
Needless to say, even those countries we take as a model have to deal with a large number of problems.
If they didn't, it wouldn't be of any benefit to them to collaborate with our office, would it?
With regard to the legislation of our country, what did the amendment of the law on public awards mean for your Office?
Given that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, it has not yet been manifested in the control actions.
Since we carry out ex-post checks, there must be a certain delay.
For now, it is observed in the process of preparation of future controls: we have started a new tool of "detection of non-economic risks", through which we have passed almost 14,000 public awards, which have been analyzed. The changes will be perfectly reflected here, as the limits are modified, the conditions of some types of the selection process are rectified and the like.
Do you consider that the approval of this law is beneficial or that, rather, it is a mess for the bureaucratic system?
I think this law is surely a step in the right direction and I hope it is.
The problem that can arise is that the regulations are "hardened" and it is impossible to comply with them.
Already with the previous regulations, the controlled persons were linked to the contractor (for example, in the case of the regional operational programmes of the regional council), and every law not respected in the matter of public awards meant the violation of budgetary discipline.
Does it make sense then to harden the law in this way?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack or take advantage of it and not punish those who make a formal ruling, which has no bearing on decision-making.
Such a system will only create more bureaucratic pressure.
And how do you get out of this?
We will see where this initiated path leads us.
The Prime Minister has recently stated that the SDGs would not bother entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called <0xC5><0xA1>varc system, with reference to the fact of being autonomous only on paper.
Is the <0xC5><0xA1>varc" system prohibited or allowed?
The law must be regulated in some way and, if it prohibits something, then not even the prime minister of the government can prevent the action of the Office that has the obligation to carry out such checks and demand obligations.
You can say, “We change the law and we allow it,” but you can’t say we’re going to act like it.
In the law on public awards, the rules are quite strict as to how formal action should be taken, and that is how it should be in order to protect public competition.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic that the candidate with the best offer is excluded for not meeting the formal requirements.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct. This is, in my opinion, what we lack.
The roads have ice plates, although they are mostly passable
In several places in the Czech Republic the roads have ice and snow plates.
Although most roads are passable, caution should be exercised in some.
Karlovy Vary Region
Today morning the roads in the Karlovy Vary region were passable, but they featured ice and snow plates.
The temperature drops and will oscillate between five and ten degrees below zero. During the day the thermometers will rise slightly.
It has stopped snowing in the region and in the low areas the snow cover is thin.
On the other hand, on the ridges of the Montes Metálicos the snow reaches almost 30 centimeters.
In some places visibility was still poor due to fog, according to information from the region’s road operations control center.
The R6 expressway and the first-class road in the region are now unimpeded.
However, extreme caution is recommended, especially on some bridges whose surface may be icy and slippery.
In addition, all the second and third category roads are also passable, including mountain roads.
However, in some of them there are still sections with remnants of ice and crushed snow.
Attention needs to be increased on the road, especially in the higher areas.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové Region
On some roads in eastern Bohemia there is a danger of frost and in higher areas and in the mountains a layer of snow may have formed on the roads, the Directorate of Roads and Highways reports in its pages.
Road operators warn drivers of the danger of ice sheets forming, especially in higher areas of the Pardubice region.
Frosts can occur in the vicinity of Lan<0xC5><0xA1>krouna, <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Orlic<0xC3><0xAD>, Poli<0xC4><0x8D>ky, Svitav or Vysokého M<0xC3><0xBD>ta, and especially on the second and third category roads.
The I/43 and I/34 roads in Svitav have been chemically treated.
There is snow especially on the mountain roads from Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e to Orlické hory.
There is a layer of tamped snow on the highest areas of the roads in the municipalities of Rychnov nad Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>nou and Trutnov.
In the area of eastern Bohemia, the sky today will be between clear and partially cloudy, with no precipitation.
Temperatures will usually range between three below zero and a positive degree, a weak wind will blow.
Pilsen Region
The roads in the Pilsen region are passable today morning, although caution should be exercised and it will be necessary to adapt to the weather.
In the early hours of the morning there will be frost, temperatures will range between three and nine degrees below zero.
After snowfall and the subsequent drop in temperatures, some roads could also be covered in ice.
In some places drivers will encounter fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is what emerges from the information of the control center of road operations in the region.
The D5 motorway is passable almost without restrictions, although extreme caution is recommended, especially on the road between kilometer 80 and 131.
The surface of most first-class roads is dry and ice-free.
In the area of the Pilsen and Tachov road bordering Germany there may be stretches with ice plates.
The second and third category tracks are wet, so, in this case, you can also see sections with ice plates.
Drivers should be more cautious, especially on less busy roads in the <0xC5><0xA0>umava area.
Olomouc Region
Drivers heading to the higher areas of the Olomouc region will encounter partially discarded snow.
After the chemical treatment, there was still snow in the port of <0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské and on the road towards Videlsk<0xC3><0xBD> k<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xBE>.
Road operators removed snow overnight; about three centimetres of snow accumulated on the <0xC5><0xA0>umper road, according to road managers.
In the rest of the region, most of the roads are unimpeded.
“In the higher areas of the <0xC5><0xA0>umper road, there are remnants of snow.
Drivers in the port of <0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské will encounter half-discarded snow in the direction of Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k," a road administration official from <0xC5><0xA0>umper told the <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
On the ground and at night their colleagues also went to the Jesenická and, after the chemical treatment, the tracks of the highest areas are now clear and wet.
On the Olomouc road the roads are unhindered, on the <0xC5><0xA0>ternberská road drivers should drive with caution on the forest sections, where the roads are still wet.
<0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem Region and Liberec Region
Northern Bohemian road operators have reported complications on different sections early in the morning.
Apart from some places where it has snowed or iced, according to the police database the mountain road between Telnice and Kn<0xC3><0xAD>nice in the <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem region is closed.
Temperatures remain sub-zero, even in the lower areas, so ice and snow obviously remain on the roadway, while in the lower areas, especially in the south-east of the Czech central massif, there are no problems and the roads are usually dry.
For the time being, no service complications have been recorded.
Road operators have warned of the presence of ice in the vicinity of <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>t<0xC3><0xAD>.
According to meteorologists, the conditions have been ideal during the night. During the day rain and snow are expected to melt and at night the sky will be clear and there will be ice.
Unfavourable conditions have been announced from the general roads on the I/13 road, on the border between the <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem region and Liberec.
The road between Telnice and Kn<0xC3><0xAD>nice had to be cut by the branches of the trees that had arched over the track with the weight of the snow.
<0xC5><0xA0>imon Ornest: In our concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
It is said that in a little less than a month the end of the world will come, what do you think about it?
It’s just one of many alarmist news stories that we like to hold on to.
The music group The Tap Tap likes to make jokes about this and we like to say that we are the only music group in the world that manages to gather enough positive energy to postpone the end of the world or to avoid it.
In addition, in December you organize a really original project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you explain it to our readers?
This is a state charity that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential that has the end of the Mayan calendar enunciated for December 21 at 11:10 in the morning.
The day before, on December 20th at 9 pm, we will organize 3 simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end at approximately the same time as the Mayan calendar ends on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean, 12 hours ahead of our time zone.
Who came up with this idea?
Initially it was my idea, then we were forging the project all together with our designer Honza Augusta.
In addition to wanting to gather enough positive energy and avoid the end of the world, we also want to reflect, together with society, on the state in which we will leave the world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar we have also created a unique collection of items: boots, t-shirts, bags and original keychains against the end of the world that can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz, another way to support us.
The group The Tap Tap, along with other performers, also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world, which is entitled "End of the world, canceled".
It is currently very popular on YouTube, will you be able to hear it at charity concerts?
Of course it is, and it will be just the last, well, as long as everything goes well and the world does not end...
It will be sung by all performers at the same time in all three concerts.
The anthems will be linked together simultaneously thanks to the special live broadcast on Czech Television.
Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Hanák has written the lyrics of this song and plays the leading role of Jesus in the music video, where he also sings Xindl X...
How did this collaboration come about?
We work together even with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, apart from organizing many charity events and concerts...
We are fully committed to participating in this project.
It has been shown that most of them are interested and enjoy working with us.
What will the money raised at the concerts against the end of the world be used for?
To equip the educational center without barriers Studeo, which we completed in its sixth consecutive year with the civil association Tap in Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v <0xC3><0xBA>stav.
The pupils of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v <0xC3><0xBA>stav school are regularly visited by teachers with whom they carry out fun and interesting activities.
Students do not have sufficient financial means to pay teachers and we make an effort to make it possible.
In the framework of the completion of the works in Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v <0xC3><0xBA>stav, there will be an independent building to which we will move with this project.
Several groups and performers perform at each concert.
What are the selection criteria?
We try to develop a program that is attractive to all generations, including children.
For example, Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango and Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Such<0xC3><0xBD> will perform in Prague.
For more detailed information, please visit www.kpks.cz.
Do you have any other similar “spectacular action” planned in the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the festival Pra<0xC5><0xBE>ské jaro, so here we will surely prepare an attractive program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play at the Bohemian National Hall in New York and myself, personally, taking advantage of the fact that we are in the United States, I would like to complete it with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not exactly minimalist, so far you have acted for example in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group made up of people with disabilities.
How is the logistics and organization of these trips?
It is not as difficult as it may seem at first glance.
There are five members in an electric wheelchair, the chairs must travel in the luggage compartment and we also carry a lot of weight, the boxes with the instruments...
However, so far we have managed well, <0xC4><0x8C>SA and British Airways were perfectly prepared, which does not stop surprising me.
Even in Moscow, from where we recently returned, everything went smoothly.
Thanks to the trips abroad you can compare the different attitudes of society towards the disabled and other aspects.
What have you found so far?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here; in Russia we have witnessed that, in the east, there is still a long way to go.
Unlike Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, there it remains infrequent for a person to travel alone through the city center in an electric wheelchair.
Something as common as, for example, giving preference to someone in a wheelchair in an elevator, there it is not.
Fortunately, a civil association had been set up which endeavoured to discuss the problems of persons with disabilities.
In what respects should we take the example of more advanced countries?
There are a lot of things we go after...
But it is important to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the people it directly affects.
In London and Madrid it is very normal for people with a serious disability to go out on their own in public and be able to go to the service, to the museum, wherever...
But it is not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to actively participate in social life, in this regard, with The Tap Tap we are a little ahead!
A respectful or barrier-free society is one thing, but when the time comes for eminent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers to emerge, it will begin to really change everything.
So far, they are isolated cases of people who have great willpower.
The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, but if we look back a few years, what led you to form the group in 1998?
I entered as an educator in Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v <0xC3><0xBA>stav, where I had a lot of young people around me who wanted to dedicate themselves to something.
And since I am a musician, I play, among others, the saxophone, I founded an amateur group with a co-worker.
And over time, as our moderator Lá<0xC4><0x8F>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D> says, it got a little out of hand (laughs).
However, the popularity did not reach until these last years, or am I wrong?
It is true that it helped us a lot to connect with famous singers and also actively work to promote the group.
We come to the conclusion that the work that is not seen, is as if it did not exist.
Thanks to the support of the European Union, we can also afford quality teaching, equipment, etc.
Did you intend to go that far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning I saw the potential there was, that something could be done differently.
The show business world is full of things that look like each other.
It is logical, in its own way, that everything new is welcomed with caution and takes a long time to accept.
There are few extraordinary things, but I dare say that The Tap Tap is one of them.
The impression of someone seeing us for the first time is clearly compassion, it's a natural reaction...
But compassion is totally superfluous because people with disabilities are not abandoned beings who suffer and for whom we should have compassion.
There are people who are able to live a full life and develop, on the condition, of course, that they have the necessary means.
I always say that if something goes well for people with disabilities, then it is not only a breakthrough for them, but for the whole society.
Did it help the fact that you are a demanding boss, as many people describe you?
If we want to do quality work, we have to be rigorous in many aspects and demand some discipline.
I think it's completely normal.
Some people arrive with a romantic vision and with their head in the clouds and when they learn that they have to go two days to rehearse, go to the preparatory test and spend a lot of time traveling and in concerts, the initial euphoria quickly leaves them.
But that’s how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and get something done.
The Tap Tap currently has 20 members.
How many of them were already at the beginning of 1998?
Only one: Lá<0xC4><0x8F>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D>.
We are an open group, people come and go, you can’t help it.
Who has will and desire will always find the doors open
It will be the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21 hours
It will take place at the Incheba Arena in Prague, at Fléda in Brno and at Plynojem in Ostrava and will involve 12 groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic
The three cities will connect at the end of the evening via videoconference to sing together the song of the group The Tap Tap "End of the world, canceled"
The aim of the concert is to gather the necessary resources to finance multifunctional equipment of the STUDEO barrier-free educational center in Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v <0xC3><0xBA>stav of Prague, whose cost amounts to 25 million Czech crowns.
Admission to the concert costs 400 CZK and children up to 12 years old have free admission in the early bird option at Bohemiaticket
Poland and the Cosmos.
At last week’s meeting of European Space Agency (ESA) countries, Poland was accepted as the 12th member of ESA, the second member of ESA from the former Eastern European bloc, after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on 12 November 2008.
Poland began an intense collaboration with ESA in 1994 and during the following years participated in the agency’s project commission.
However, Poland’s journey into the cosmos began much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts were already engaged in space flights before World War II, although their work was not always understood.
I recall, for example, A. <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld's lecture at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory in which, on 6 December 1933, he presented his ideas on the pioneering study "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left attendees indifferent, and years later <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld recalled that Dr. Jan Gadomski had been the only one who had shown interest in his work.
In 1934 <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prize in France for his "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned above, later became a great promoter of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and wrote a series of books dedicated to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a promoter of cosmonautics, he was known throughout the world and his contribution to science was rewarded when his name was given to one of the craters on the far side of the moon.
Already in 1925 a dresina was built in Poland that was to be provided with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, it is not known who was the author of the proposal and neither are the details of the project.
It is not clear if the rocket was to be used for the start of the dresin or for its braking.
The information about this dress is limited to the collection in the press of the time.
From 1933, the Polish artillery began to focus on missiles.
The research was funded by Komorka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and Prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim.
From the preserved material, it becomes evident that the investigation reached the stage of practical tests.
However, with the arrival of German troops, the investigation was interrupted.
In 1937 appeared in the specialized press the prototype of a photoelectric hunting missile designed by the engineer Rohozi<0xC5><0x84>ski and the following year the study "Rakieta - torpedo powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki was published.
Both projects were intended for military use of missile engines.
Shortly before the war, the Provisional Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) was responsible for all missile technology projects for military use and coordinated all work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, it was interrupted by the start of the war.
Other studies dedicated to cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
In the November 1954 issue of the journal Problemy, reference is made for the first time to society with four very extensive articles devoted to astronautics.
In one of them, Prof. M. Subotowicze, proposed the creation of a society that would be dedicated to cosmonautics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was obvious that cosmic research was a discipline with prospects for the future.
From the beginning of 1956 the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) aspired to become part of the International Astronautical Federation (founded in 1951) and in the autumn of that same year the PTA became a full member.
The following year the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became the vice-president of the International Astronautical Federation.
He held this position until his death in 1959.
Starting in 1956, the PTA participated significantly in the development of the RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna) sounding rocket, which was a success and became the first Polish rocket in which scientific research was carried out.
The first RM-1 type was completed in 1957 and was first launched on October 10, 1958.
The rocket had an apogee of 1,800 meters, about 80 cm in length and did not reach 5 kg in weight.
Later, the RM-1A version was completed and in the summer of 1959 aerial tests of the two-stage RM-2 rockets began in the B<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>d<0xC3><0xB3>w desert.
The rocket measured 1.4 meters and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another type of rocket under development was to be the subject of real scientific study. The RM-34 rocket was to have a peak of 14.5 km and its mission would be to control the wind from above.
In 1962, however, work was suspended.
The successor to the first RM-type rockets was the Meteor-1 rocket, which was built during the years 1962 and 1965.
It was designed as a two-stage rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types were developed (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differed from each other by the space available for scientific apparatus.
In the Meteor-1A the space available for the volume was 0.4 liters, in the Meteor-1B 0.34 liters and in the Meteor-1C 0.62 liters.
The maximum apogee in all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968 the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Air Institute, whose first aerial tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a useful weight of 10 kg up to 60 km in height.
The Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were later built.
It is also necessary to mention the entry of Poland into the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the formation of the national committee of COSPAR two years later.
Within the framework of the Interkosmos program, Poland joined the research of cosmic space on Soviet artificial satellites and, in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Remek.
The suspension of the law on social work is not the solution.
Last week the constitutional court suspended the social work law.
The resolution sparked a heated discussion in society.
Of course it will be interesting to examine the existing problems from a broader point of view.
Liberal economic systems in the EU, as in the globalised world, are based on the principle of greater economic competition and less regulation.
Consequently, this means that different economic forms and national economic systems are in permanent conflict with each other.
The cause lies in the principle of free trade and the free and unlimited movement of private capital, together with unbridled financial speculation.
The effect of large differences in labour costs (wages) produces economic tensions.
Under this concept it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, with the import of cheap goods, tries to shorten distances and to do so "causes a drop" in the price of the competitor with the aim of taking over most of the market and, in this way, increase its profit margin.
On a large scale it means, for most entrepreneurs, moving production abroad, buying cheaper there or disappearing. The result is high unemployment in those countries where the price of labour, compared to other economies, is higher.
Because private capital has no social responsibility and is thus not responsible for the unemployment that this phenomenon generates, the social expenditure of the state necessarily increases.
All this situation leads to the total disinterest of the entrepreneurs to pay taxes and compensate for the economic and social damages they have caused in their desire to obtain profits.
The situation is universally so well known that it is not necessary to present specific statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital create situations, in certain economies, in which the governments of these countries are forced to compete with the aim of artificially reducing the social level of the population itself and, in this way, attracting foreign capital to the country.
Put another way, governments make private capital available to their own population without regard to social decline.
This is particularly evident in the changes in the laws in force.
The aim is to force the population to accept the dictates of private capital, especially with regard to wages.
This takes place, on the one hand, through the system of economic obligation in the case of long-term unemployment; on the other, through the restricted right of employees with regard to labour rights.
The result is increasing poverty along with increasing differences between the poor and the rich.
For a number of years, there have been food delivery points in Germany for poor people who cannot support themselves with their own work.
The number of people receiving this type of aid is already one million.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there is a fairly frequent case: people employed at such a low wage that the state must pay the rest to reach the minimum necessary to survive.
A scandal of this kind was made public in connection with the situation of auxiliary employees of the German federal parliament.
The savings measures of practically all the southern EU states undoubtedly lead to the same situation. People, pressured by an abysmal decline of their social level, are forced to emigrate as in the nineteenth century or to live on a lousy wage at the limit of society, in the hope that one day they will arrive in the country private investment capital.
Is it necessary to ask where it comes from?
In the case of other EU countries, then poverty passes from one country to another or never arrives, since Chinese, Indians, Brazilians, Turks, Moroccans, Egyptians or Africans continue to work for a tiny part of a European salary.
This also affects all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media claim to the full that the state should not contribute capital to the economy, that running the economy leads to its failure.
Private capital defends tooth and nail the thesis that the state should not intervene in the economy by meddling in control.
Then it is necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence with its selfishness in the political march and, therefore, in the whole state.
In this case the answer is clearly affirmative.
The proof is the existence of lobbies, in practice very powerful and ubiquitous, in all states.
The result is a desperate situation that manifests itself in the realm of corruption, in mutual favors, in legislation that is virtually reprehensible everywhere but not punishable.
In Germany, the situation is as follows: State ministries, in the absence of financial resources, entrust the drafting of bills to private legal firms, which are often linked to industry.
These kinds of bills are then passed in the Bundestag, the German parliament.
Thus, all power does not emanate from the people, as advertised in the constitutions of Western democracies, but from the strong financial groups that represent their own interests.
It is obvious that democracies with a liberal orientation quickly find themselves in a situation like the one described by Appianos in his work The Crisis of the Roman Republic in the Times of Caesar and Pompeii: "The state had been disintegrating for some time and the administrations were busy by force."
In exchange for bribes, illegitimately obtained favors and help to finance stones or swords.
Bribery and corruption spread unimpeded and people went to the polls with the vote pre-approved"... "there were no people with character who aspired to a position in the administration, so once, because of this disorganization, the state was eight months without consuls"... "Although Caesar always thought it necessary to go to the polls with the vote pre-approved"... "there were no people with character who aspired to a position in the administration, so serious that once, the state was eight months without consuls"... "...
The conclusion, as in antiquity, is that present-day society is based on inconsiderate preferences of individual profit without regard to common interests.
Private capital is not capable, in its essence, of understanding and claiming the benefits of the whole of society.
The result is the same as then, an unprecedented decline of the elite, with no effort being made to reform it in depth.
The causes of the rise of fascist and communist regimes must therefore be sought in the unbridled liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
With respect to the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of a liberal type of democracy, as a definite pause, waiting for the next blow.
The really devastating fact is that the current elite completely ignores the losses of hundreds of thousands in lives, social and humanitarian catastrophes that we have witnessed, as well as the crimes against humanity as we know them in ancient and most recent history.
The suspension of the law on public awards is not the solution; at least not in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both internationally and within the EU, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue looking for other ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is, therefore, systemic.
The solution lies in concrete socio-political reforms, which strengthen both the participation of state capital and the influence of citizens in government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.

After the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, diverse reactions have emerged, as always.
One, on Israel’s side, argues for the right of self-defense and pigeonholes Palestinians into the role of terrorists; the other supports Palestinians and alleges racism on the part of the State of Israel, genocide perpetrated against Palestinian Arabs and branding Israel a terrorist state.
I do not want to focus on who is to blame for the periodically recurring killings and who is the victim; after all, today's citizens of Israel, including the autonomous territories, were born into the current political situation and did not experience the beginnings of violence.
My intention is to offer readers a look behind the curtain, a look to discover who is taking advantage of the tensions that have dragged on for 95 years (calculated from the Balfour declaration in November 1917) on a small area of land in the Middle East.
Some of my considerations are based on historical facts, others on conclusions I have reached on the basis of my own way of understanding the matter, about who or what group of people is the main driver of events in modern history.
In the history of mankind the history of power struggles is in the front row.
In every age we can find a Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
But what is no longer so evident is whether it was always these characters who directed their steps autonomously or if behind their throne there was someone who directed their actions towards a certain objective.
We must accept that we live in an age that concentrates the wealth of the world in the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration of money and the power that this implies has not been achieved in a single generation.
Among these astronomically rich families stands out one that could be considered the most prominent (if there is still someone behind, I do not know, but I do not rule it out): the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about them.
Of course.
In the 1990s, they bought the first news agency (Reuters) to stop associating their name with very serious criminal acts. Power and wealth, or both, covered their backs, which for them always meant a strengthening.
They have significant stakes in almost all the central banks of the world and in those countries in which they are not represented, a war has been declared or is being prepared: before the attack on Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq there were 5, after overthrowing Gaddafi there were only four, but in the meantime Russia has subordinated the central bank to the Russian government.
Everyone who has tried to oppose this family has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the Rothschild’s Bank of America central bank status, began printing money during the Civil War, and was assassinated in 1865 in the theater.
JFK began printing money and wanted to suspend the federal reserve system (FED) and was assassinated in 1963; Congressman Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after wanting to sue the FED for having triggered the great economic crisis of 1929.
Their desire for world power led them during the years 1859 - 1871 to draw up a plan with three world wars, designed by the Freemason Albert Pike, decorated with the 33rd degree.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great monarchical states throughout Europe; the second wanted to eliminate colonial supremacy, especially of Great Britain, and the third was aimed at reducing the population of the earth between half a million and a billion people (such a quantity of slaves for their well-being and luxury would be enough and would not consume so many resources), in addition to the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than a pre-eminence).
The method with which the group of the richest families operates, together with the Rothschilds, follows the dynamics of the triggering of crises and the subsequent offer of a solution (order ab cao - order from chaos).
These solutions are, however, wrong, and always lead to a worsening of the situation. If not, it is enough to remember that the FED was created so that a crisis such as that of 1907 would not be repeated.
So, after the successful assassination of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Franz Ferdinand, in Sarajevo and after World War I ensued, they smashed Tsarist Russia with the start of the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended suddenly and unjustifiably from the military and economic point of view, the capitulation of Germany (the wars to end tsarist Russia were already unnecessary) and the subsequent dismemberment of the great power of Central Europe, the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
In order to prepare the ground for the Second World War, they allowed the bankers and politicians to create, in a covert way, a conflictive situation in the wake of the enormous war reparations imposed on Germany, which created the optimal conditions for the radicalization of the impoverished masses.
In the late 19th century, the Rothschilds spearheaded the founding of the Zionist movement, a branch that aspired to the formation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of ancient Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The aforementioned Balfour declaration laid the groundwork for mass immigration of Jews to Palestine and the first conflicts with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist attacks were taking place on both sides.
The Second World War broke out: it is difficult to know whether Hitler pulled too much of the rope to which he had been tied by the international bankers in the beginning or whether everything he did was part of a plan. However, the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the optimal conditions for the acceptance of the Jewish state in world society.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, similar to the way in which the war reparations imposed on Germany paved the way for World War II, the proclamation of the state of Israel created the focus for a third war.
If the international bankers were to succeed in starting it, the Jewish nation, as in World War II, would become a victim in the front line of combat, now along with the Arab or, generally, Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is a huge laboratory, a machine of welding and chaos, not only within the framework of its country, but also on an international scale. Let us take as an example how Israel's supporters and detractors are sharply divided.
Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict? Where does injustice engender injustice in a spiral of endless violence, if at the beginning of everything was the greed of some individuals and their desire for world power?
At this point it is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and its leaders, because, as happens in our country, international bankers only present their candidates in the elections.
The current president of Israel B. Netanyahu is the typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, who does everything possible to declare war on Iran and, considering that Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to become a global conflict and, if we take into account that Iran controls only the Strait of Hormuz miles, through which passes 20% of all world oil (the shipping corridor)
In what light are now shown the words of David Rockefeller in 1994: “All we need is a general crisis and the people will agree to a new world order.”
The new world order in your imagination is a world of lords and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the population serves a handful of people who are part of the well-off financial aristocracy.
A world in which each new individual is implanted with a chip at birth that controls their entire being.
And it forces everyone, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to have a mark on their right hand or forehead, to be unable to buy or sell, unless they bear the name of this monster or the figures of his name.
It is necessary to understand it: whoever has two fingers in front, add up the numbers of this monster.
The number marks the person and this number is six hundred and sixty-six."
Argo Movie: If It Gets Raw, Call Hollywood
In November 1979 a group of Islamist student protesters occupied the American embassy in Tehran and took 52 graduates hostage.
His release was to be in exchange for the dethroned Shah Mohamed Reza Pahlevi, who after the revolution fled to the US, a country that had sponsored his regime for decades.
For the American administration, the situation offered no positive perspective: throwing the shah overboard could not be allowed to do so, since, if it did, it endangered the confidence of its allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to the constitution of the theocratic regime, was not within their reach.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which subsequently intensified further with the failed attempt to free the hostages by force.
The imprisoned diplomats were released 444 days after the Algerian government’s negotiating intervention.
In the US, their fate caused a wave of solidarity and animosity against Iran.
The failure in Iran contributed decisively to Jimmy Carter's defeat by Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film "Argo" by director and actor Ben Affleck thematizes an episode of this story, which garnered a small success for America.
Shortly before occupying the embassy, six employees escaped from the building.
After a complicated journey, they ended up in the residence of the Canadian embassy.
The CIA, in collaboration with Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, for which a cover story helped an extravagant point: they left with Canadian passports, as members of the film team that examined the location in the country for the filming of a sci-fi blockbuster.
Combination of genres
The plan outlined by “exfiltration” expert Toni Mendez required Hollywood collaboration.
To make the lie seem truthful, it was written about the film project in specialized magazines, press conferences were organized, the fictional production company even had a real office.
Details about the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film has been made from the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck’s film is a singular combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller; on the other, a so-called "caper movie", the story of an episode that went well, a hoax (an example can be the series Ocean's Eleven).
In the film, moods are combined. On the one hand, we find well-documented sequences from Tehran. In the sequence of credits, emblematic photographs of the time of the events are shown, which were captured in the same way in the film; there are not many differences in this regard.
On the other, typical Hollywood scenes somewhat lighter, marked by irony and a slight exaggeration.
And besides, scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions: dressed men analyzing the situation at the negotiating table, in the corridors of the office, by phone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in an excellent way.
The actor, who had been the object of ridicule, has become a respectable director and his way of acting has ceased to be the target of ironic comments.
Argo is his third feature film, after "Adi<0xC3><0xB3>s peque<0xC3><0xB1>a, Adi<0xC3><0xB3>s" (2007) and the thriller "The Town. City of Thieves" (2010).
At the same time, it is Affleck's first film in which the action has no place in the city of Boston, where he was raised.
Also, the sensitivity of capturing the atmosphere of the place was a feature that placed the directors of old films above Hollywood standards.
And Affleck proves it in Argo, where Tehran "wheels" in Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, in the reconstruction of the true events. The introductory sequence of the taking of the embassy is impressive for its synoptic ability that, at the same time, conveys the emotion of bewilderment and lack of foresight that arises when, somewhere, the story takes a step forward.
Affleck and his collaborators achieve a similar effect in the fictional scenes (the imposter team in the Tehran bazaar).
Too much action in too many places
The director had to accept the fact that an explained story doesn’t offer much in the cinematic sense of the most intriguing scenes.
Sometimes it adds something to reality: here everything doesn’t come out so elegantly (the scene in which the crisis lurks at the airport in Tehran, the deflection of a call to America and the unbridled search behind its track become madness).
Argo’s weakness is the lack of control that arises from the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a very funny role as Hollywood collaborators, although their characters deserved more space and are by no means the only ones in this film.
For these reasons, Affleck’s film loses a bit of a dramatic streak, but it is a film that can be followed with moderate interest, valuing its realization and the retro style of a thriller that evokes the 70s.
But to collapse, that will be difficult.
As an evocation of a real history and as proof of how exaggerated the notions of omnipresence and omniscience of the secret services can be, it is enough.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circus
The www.bankovnipoplatky.com server, which every year presents a survey on the most absurd bank fees, has now decided to announce the contest on "the most absurd regulation or ideas of the EU workshop".
"It occurred to us after the last event, the EU plans to approve a quota of 40 percent of women in management positions in large European companies," explained Pravo Patrik Nacher, the organizer of the survey.
Among the absurdities nominated is, for example, the recent decision of the European court to unify insurance policies between men and women.
Until now, women have taken advantage of better life insurance prices because they objectively pose a lower risk.
“Other amazing ideas from the EU workshop can be put forward by people until the end of this year.”
The election will take place at the end of February 2013,” Nacher said.
Among the controversial EU regulations is, for example, the mandatory addition of bio-components to the fuel which, as a result, harms the environment; another ban is the use of lifetime mercury thermometers only because they contain a small amount of a hazardous substance or the guideline overshadows the size of chicken cages, which has contributed to the considerable increase in the price of eggs this year.
There has been criticism of the factual ban on the use of the term "butter spread" or the removal of the classic light bulb from shops.
A quality banana should have a length of 14 centimeters.
The Union apparatus often makes such decisions under pressure from one or another mercantile or industrial lobby, whose demands in Brussels are normally defended by some state or group of states (the Czech Republic, even with the threat of a veto, vindicates the demands of its banks).
The interests of a lobby were behind the request, for example, that higher-quality bananas should be at least 14 centimetres long in the EU and could not exhibit "abnormal curvatures".
The European Commission defended itself by saying that with this it only seeks to harmonise the national rules not homogenised to date, which only complicated their marketing.
The rules referring to fruit and vegetables in the EU, despite opposition from some states, have been softened on the basis that the existing directive entails a waste of foodstuffs.
The candidate to win the survey could be last year’s EU prescription that in inflatable balloons that are marketed it is mandatory to warn that children under 8 years of age are not allowed to inflate them without adult supervision.
The EU was referring here to an American study according to which, when talking about toys, balloons are the main cause of infant death by suffocation.
A similar restriction on the use of silkscreens by children up to the age of 14 is also in force.
Curious occurrences are born even in our country
Equally absurd is the regulation concerning European officials: anyone who has any official function in the EU can not use the name of Macedonia. In order not to hurt the sensitivity of Greece, we must talk about FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovn<0xC3><0xAD>poplatky.com server, in collaboration with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, nominated in the survey, among some absurd proposals mentioned above, the prescription of the Union on the volume of food supplies in the territory of a Member State.
The EU determined the maximum volumes of food supplies that can be found on the territory of the Czech Republic on the same day as our entry into the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the volume established for canned mushrooms, posing a threat of a substantial fine.
The survey organizers were also interested in the occurrence of paying those countries that do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a grant for the application for grants.
These ideas did not arise in Brussels but in Prague.
"We are at a disadvantage because we don't have the sea.
We are asking the European Union for compensation," then-agriculture minister Jaroslav Palas (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) said in autumn 2004.
He argued this with the fact that in our country a lot of grain was produced and, as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, the state had full warehouses and had to export.
According to Palas, since the Czech Republic is far from seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
In the end, the European Commission was willing to help the Czech Republic and organized a public tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The grant to receive a grant was proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry for Local Development led by Minister Pavel N<0xC4><0x9B>mec (US-DEU). Specifically, it is intended for the drafting of grant applications from Brussels.
EU: Rare prescriptions are an exception
The guidelines of the Member States are often criticised, the EU's regulatory efforts and also more effective functioning and development across the Union deserve our recognition, according to several experts.
According to experts, the most serious problem is, for example, the collection of EU subsidies for projects that have nothing to do with the deepening of European integration, but which the member states have achieved in the negotiations on budgets.
The Czechs, like other countries of the Union, are also in the fight for the right to the designation of origin of their traditional products, even though our country has not always been victorious in these struggles.
The Czechs, after six years of disputes with Germans and Austrians, successfully defended the designation of origin of the Olomouc cottage cheese, but had to change the name to the national rum, whose tradition in our country dates back to the nineteenth century, and was renamed "tuzemák".
Only products made from sugar cane distillate can be called rum, but not those made from sugar beet.
In the official list of protected designations of origin of the EU, together with the feta and gorgonzola cheeses known throughout the world, the marzipan of the German city of L<0xC3><0xBC>beck or the ham of Parma, there are already for example the Karlovy Vary biscuits, the carp of Poho<0xC5><0x99>elice and T<0xC5><0x99>ebo<0xC5><0x88> and even the variety of l<0xC3><0xBA>pulo.
As protected maras of the EU, you can be proud of the gingerbread of Pardubice and the wafers of Ho<0xC5><0x99>ice v Podkrkono<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD>.
People want me to save the republic, but I'm an amateur, says Okamura
Senator, how did you come up with the idea of running for president?
It's not about being a senator or president.
If everything in our country were fine, then I wouldn't run for office.
But I can no longer bear to see how it has been stolen in the last twenty years in our country, how thieves go unpunished, taxes are increased and the retirement age is increased.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
When I see something I don’t like, I try to come up with a solution to change it.
And since I’m already forty and my candidacy is independent, the only chance I have to change things is to run as a senator or president.
The Senate has already arrived, but soon after it has set out on its way to the presidency.
Are you not turning your back on those who voted for you?
I always said that my candidacy for president depended on the results in the Senate elections.
I later said that if I was elected senator, I would run for president.
But my goal is not function; function is the tool with which I can realize my own ideas.
That is why I need the greatest possible influence and the strongest possible mandate.
The problem is not just that we are a nation that we criticize in the bar or in front of the television, but that we trample on anyone who wants to initiate a change.
To this is added the media, which discredits you and confuses freedom of expression with the freedom to lie.
I am said to have bribed journalists or been an adviser to Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Paroubek.
Let's talk about your ideas.
He presents himself to the presidential struggle with financial theses and criminal responsibilities of politicians and the declaration of property over twenty million.
For that, the law must be changed.
As president, he does not have this competence and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve it?
As a citizen, I have been part of a pressure group to make the job of guide recognized as autonomous work, and we achieved it.
The problem is in politics: if someone arrives with a good proposal, either from the right or the left, they are purposely rejected and this affects the citizens.
As an independent candidate, I have greater potential to win the support of all parliamentary groups.
Without pigeonholes or party dogmas, I have the ability to pick something from each party that is best for our country and apply it.
Do you consider yourself a right-winger or a left-winger?
From the Czech point of view, I have the impression that people consider me more left-wing.
It doesn’t matter to me, whether it’s a little bit left or a little bit right.
What matters to me is that we move forward.
I don’t care if someone is right-wing or left-wing, I want to bring people together.
I always openly support any good solution, regardless of whether the proposal comes from the KS<0xC4><0x8C>M or the ODS and, likewise, I will be against bad ideas.
You're joking when people say you're a populist.
But you're not proving it with what you're saying?
When you create a business plan for the company, you also have certain goals and ideals.
And you try to get close to them.
There will be those who call it populism, but all the proposals of which I speak already work in the world or known experts talk about them.
But without the support of parliament, only slogans remain.
And with that it cannot survive in long-term politics.
Or do you think that if you address people and talk to them, you will get, for example, criminal and financial responsibility?
I don't have a choice.
Convince politicians, journalists and civil society and try to put them on my side to achieve it.
If he were elected president, there would be no problem in organizing a live television broadcast in which he would ask the leaders of the parliamentary parties to legitimize criminal and financial responsibility for politicians, officials, judges and state prosecutors.
And eventually, they would have to communicate why they don’t want to.
If there is a strong character who points out the disputes, you can put pressure on the political scene.
Take for instance the direct election of the president, which has been an achievement of public pressure.
At the same time I affirm that I am only an amateur, I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
For my opinions and ideals I try to find allies.
I just started in politics and I try to get as much support as possible for my program.
I try to get things done myself, but in case it doesn’t go well, in six years I’ll leave it and go back to the private sector.
It sounds a bit like Okamura is going to save the Czech Republic.
I'm no savior.
I know that with one person I do nothing, so I have visited a number of well-known personalities, in case they were perhaps encouraged to present their candidacy to the Senate.
I went to see Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, but he refused because he had a lot of work to do.
For my part, at least I have supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who brought to light the frauds with light heating oils.
I introduced myself on the basis that people are really dissatisfied, now I’m in the balance.
Sixty percent of the population did not go to the polls and, those who did, voted for the representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate we are two from the independent sector.
The people chose the Senate, so that it will be difficult to achieve changes.
However, I will defend my own ideas, such as the direct election of mayors or governors.
Are you considering forming your own party?
I haven’t considered it yet because I don’t have time for it, to check the unblemished past of each of the potential party members, nor do I have any money.
I have no money even for the campaign for the presidency, in my transparent account there are only 20,000 kroner.
You don't have any money?
Talk about property statements, how is yours?
I estimate my private property at about 60 million.
In Prague I have a land valued at 25 million, a flat valued at ten million, another flat valued at eight million, a collection of works of art valued at ten million, an Aston Martin of about 3.5 million and a <0xC5><0xA0>koda Superb valued at one million, and in the account I have a couple of million.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my dream of youth. I always liked James Bond, who drove this car, was gallant with women and, at the same time, fought against evils and injustices.
He drives an Aston Martin, his property is valued at 60 million and he has no money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the republic but you don't want to put too much money on your side.
It's not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to go into debt?
I have already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don’t have any sponsors shows that there isn’t much interest in my program.
And I have no obligation to pay for the campaign with money out of my pocket.
The expenses of the campaign cover in essence what I will receive as a senator’s salary.
But I couldn't live on it, for example, I couldn't pay my son for English school, which costs 30,000 kroner a month.
If I just wanted to make money, then I wouldn't run as a candidate.
So you'll continue your business so you can live?
Didn't you say before that you were going to stop this activity?
This has nothing to do with a higher salary.
As I promised, I have partly left my activities.
For example, the representative of my travel agency will become my replacement in the spring.
The people would want me to be the Samaritan to save the republic.
But I also need to live on something.
How much do you earn monthly as an entrepreneur?
Between 200,000 and 400,000, which I'm still winning.
If I were president, I would quit business.

The architectural studio MVRDV demonstrates that true adventures are not only in the head - in the example of the library of Spijkenisse and the newly completed "mountain of books"- 2 photos
“I think the building is fun, it looks futuristic, and there’s finally something interesting to see,” says Lisette Verhaig, a passer-by passing by on the street.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT technician at a large company located near the library, says: "In addition, the building is beautiful."
But I wonder why we need a library today.
We all have the Internet, tablets and e-books.
No one likes to go into those old-fashioned libraries, do they?
Spijkenisse, a sleepy city on the doorstep of Rotterdam that is hardly worth a fleeting visit, has the dubious honour of setting a record to forget.
The population of 80,000 has the lowest literacy rate in the Netherlands.
To counteract this shameful situation, a few years ago it was decided to contribute in some way to the general culture and copy the seven fictitious bridges that appear represented on the euro banknotes in the form of decorated miniatures of reinforced concrete.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And that’s how policy makers decided that there was only one way to improve statistics: build a library!
Winy Maas, from the Dutch architecture studio MVRDV, a master in the art of bar diagrams and responsible for fun and cynical buildings, took the subject with his usual serenity and appeared at the presentation of the contest in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face.
And as the jury looked around perplexed and shrugged, Maas proceeded to stack the books by size forming a pyramid and concluded his brief speech with the following words: “Dear fellow citizens:
Here it is, my proposal for Spijkenisse's mountain of books, the so-called 'Boekenberg'."
Nine years later, the 30-million-euro mountain rises in its intended location.
This is part of the revitalization project, which is completed with an underground car park, a supermarket, a post office and a couple of residential and townhouse buildings.
In early November the mountain of books was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project is also nominated for the "Dutch National Wood Award 2012".
In this way, the small city devoid of history, which until now had nothing to offer but a postmodern pedestrian area and an incredibly ugly town hall behind whose white facade one would rather intuit a dairy farm, now has a work of contemporary architecture.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The long way to the book
The first impression is that it is a book paradise under a cheese grove.
It is true that there is an elevator that transports us right to the center of this mountain massif, but true lovers of space and reading do not use it, but prefer to merge with its topography at every step of its climb to the top.
The fully glazed interior is bright and easy to see, the annealed brick floor and elegant streetlights unequivocally support the public condition of the library.
The urban environment is perfect.
When you look up you can see the park benches, dogs and children playing football.
And everywhere books, books and more books.
"Normally bookcases are arranged along the facade and in the center opens a huge dark room that is usually somewhat uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
What we have done is turn the classic spatial configuration upside down and take the reading area from the inside to the outside.
The interior of the mountain is very well used: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the environmental education center and the maintenance room.
Special mention deserves the black shelves that assume the functions of wall cladding, parapet and railing at the same time.
Sight, touch and smell are strange.
Even the most up-to-date architects and civil engineers shake their heads when they hear about this unknown material.
“We wanted to work with recycled materials,” explains Joop Trouborst, head of the project in the town of Spijkenisse.
And that’s how one day, on a Frisian farm, we came across the right by-product from agriculture.
For many years, in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands, a plastic fabric of a few millimeters thick has been used as a base to hold the roots of the crops.
It is a cheap and efficient material.
This fine fabric lasts two seasons and is then discarded.
For the library this fabric was pressed, for the first time in such quantities, to four centimetre thick plates.
With heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) changes color and becomes a dark, homogeneous and resistant material that smells like a mixture of new car and sneakers.
After 105 steps you reach the top of the mountain.
At the end of this continuous route of almost 500 meters around the mountain awaits us the reward: from the cafeteria you not only have a fantastic view of the city, but in it you can also enjoy some tasty Dutch croquettes and their ficus planted in huge pots.
These create a pleasant atmosphere while maintaining the right atmospheric humidity for this mountain of literature.
Donations for a New Soul
“Although it’s hard to believe given its large glazed surfaces, this building is an exemplary project when it comes to ecology,” says Trouborst.
The necessary heating and cooling are obtained from geothermal energy.
Although the mountain of books is located under a huge glass pyramid, even on the sunniest days the sun only shines for a few hours inside.
The huge wooden trusses located transversely to the glass fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade serve to shade and absorb most of the sun’s rays.
This creates a comfortable indoor climate.
The rest is a matter of automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the skeptical IT worker, has already dared to set foot in the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig has also been there.
Likewise, the professor of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde has visited the library. She qualifies the "Boekenberg" as the "late soul" of Spijkenisse.
The reason is that, on the occasion of the inauguration that took place a couple of weeks ago, all the inhabitants of the city were invited to donate a book from their private collection.
In this way it is intended to fill, for the moment, the optical gaps of a library that does not yet have its complete archive; currently it has 70,000 copies.
The concept has gone deep.
The shelves are full.
“There’s nothing worse than a half-empty library,” says architect Winy Maas.
"I think that thanks to our initiative now all the inhabitants have a certain link with this building.
Everyone knows that your book is part of the library.
Even if it’s just there to decorate.
In this way, the MVRDV study has achieved great success in that discipline that in specialized slang is known as "creation of an identity".
The city of Spijkenisse has written a piece of the history of literature.
No matter how young and uneducated he may be.
Finally a starting point to shape your identity.
Szabo: "The Germans must play a more prominent role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on U.S.-European relations, this puts Berlin in a rather tricky diplomatic position.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany hinted that it would vote against the proposal to grant the Palestinian territories UN observer status.
However, Berlin eventually abstained.
Why is that?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
Now, because of the special relationship that unites the country with Israel, Germany must be careful.
But at the same time I don’t think it supports the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being overly critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to establishing a no-fly zone.
It has finally been declared by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear stance when important international issues are at stake?
Yes, it is.
This is because at the moment it is reorienting its foreign policy away from a policy led, so to speak, by the United States and focusing on a German foreign policy.
And what makes things even more difficult is that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
The Germans are at a crossroads.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but are not used to doing so.
I think they are still groping about what their role will be, but they have already begun the path towards a “normal” foreign policy.
A foreign policy similar to countries like France or Great Britain.
What exactly does a “normal” foreign policy mean from the German point of view?
It is a policy that, when it comes to national interests, is willing to defend positions different from those of the United States or its European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy is strongly motivated by economic policy, i.e. exports and relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
German economic interests are to some extent different from those of other great powers and for that reason Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the stance taken with regard to the conflict in the Middle East and the UN vote?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf.
For this reason, it must be careful not to alienate itself from Arab public opinion and Arab elites.
This is important, of course.
But I would not give it so much importance since it is not a totally one-sided relationship.
However, they do play a fundamental role in German considerations.
Has Germany undermined its relationship with the US by refraining from voting on important decisions such as the vote on Palestine?
I think that in Europe, and even in the United States, the German position enjoys an enormous degree of understanding.
For this reason, I do not believe that there has been such a drastic rupture as in the case of Libya.
Germany may have earned some respect.
After all, all this has done is to show that it is a country that is taken seriously as an international actor and whose interests must be taken into account.
In Europe there are different opinions about the Palestinian initiative.
Instead, the U.S. has been clearly in favor of a veto.
Is there a disparity of opinion between the US and many European nations?
These disparities have always existed because of US domestic policy.
I think the Obama administration is secretly showing a great deal of understanding towards the European position.
But, because of the political situation here, it is clear that the government cannot defend this position in public.
I believe that the true disparity of opinions does not really have the magnitude attributed to it.
If we analyze the relations between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not at all enthusiastic about the policy he develops.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of its main partners in the EU, on the other?
I think that is precisely what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and homogeneous European policy, but that is not the case.
Therefore, they do not have the possibility of being part of a higher entity, but they must push things from their own position.
That is precisely what they are doing now with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will take a leading role in forcing Europe to adopt a European stance.
Of course, this is not at all easy for Germany, either simply because of the relationship it has with Israel.
This has always been a tricky subject.
But I think the Germans are clear that they must play the role of an independent figurehead.
Does Germany see itself in the role of an important international actor? Does Germany really want to take on a leading role?
Or perhaps you still find it difficult to accept that leadership?
Germany is not yet used to it, it is always somewhat uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country still finds it difficult to play a more important role.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, we see that every time Germany positions itself as the main actor, certain anti-German sentiments are unleashed.
This is not easy for the Germans.
This is an old problem and is that no one wants to be surrounded by enemy countries.
Seen this way, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must show a receptive attitude towards different neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.
The influence of the US in European politics is diminishing more and more, but the EU does not cover that gap at the moment, so who is left?
The Germans will have no choice but to assume a more prominent role.
Even if they don't like it, if they find it unpleasant or if it makes them an even more unpopular town, c'est la vie!

"Brand protection" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese brands
Armani is a world-renowned brand and so is Polo Ralph Lauren.
What is Armani Polo?
Behind this name hides a name officially registered in China but that has nothing to do with the original companies.
However, it enjoys protection as long as the true eponyms do not file a claim.
And even then it is not clear that they will be given the reason.
“Foreigners find it increasingly difficult to protect their trademarks in China,” said Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing law firm specializing in protection rights violations in the Far East.
Every week a new case comes to my table.
Imitators simply add a couple of letters to be able to register their trademarks.
In this way, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada, Prada-Kny is registered.
German companies are also legally copied in the same way, as has happened to the sporting goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a filing cabinet in which he keeps seats from the Beijing trademark office.
On 14 September 2010 a Chinese company applied to register the trademark Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name that was also used by the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
That the Chinese are world champions in copying and violating intellectual property rights is well known.
In the big cities there are department stores of several plants dedicated exclusively to the sale of counterfeits.
However, Pattloch’s cases are of a different nature: on behalf of his clients, he is fighting against the fact that the trademark office officially grants Chinese companies the right to take advantage of a name that is already registered elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Ming Pai" or accompanying mark.
The word has its origin in the Chinese term "Bang Dakuan",
It refers to women who have “fished” a rich man.
The Chinese government does not feel guilty.
“It’s detrimental to the business, you have to fight it,” Pattloch says.
"The brand makes water, the monopolistic position disappears and the damage to the image is enormous."
The financial losses and the procedural costs of the sectors concerned are multimillion-dollar, especially in the case of emblematic luxury products.
According to data from the market analysis company CLSA, with a volume of 15 billion euros per year China is, in size, the third market for luxury items and the fastest growing.
However, achieving the cancellation of registrations of dubious legality in the registration of trademarks is complicated and also involves a lot of money.
The process can take up to nine years and the outcome is uncertain.
Pattloch speaks of cases in which the court dismissed a lawsuit because so much time had passed that the name being sued had already become a “market reality.”
“If the plaintiff is unlucky, he may even have to pay the plagiarist money because the process has damaged the plagiarist’s brand in China,” Pattloch said.
Sometimes this is the law of the jungle.
Some of the best known cases have to do with graphic elements.
In 2009 Daimler-Benz lost a lawsuit against the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that has recently been absorbed by the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
That’s why today the Chinese can still use an emblem very similar to the Mercedes star.
Volvo’s buyer, Geely, initially used a blue-and-white logo that was largely reminiscent of BMW; the matter was settled in court and Geely had to modify it.
The clothing manufacturer Lacoste lost in China to imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo represented a crocodile looking in the opposite direction to the original.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty.
The CTMO trademark office in Beijing acknowledges that in 2010 they have had difficulties due to a shortage of equipment and staffing.
Last year, however, “the work emergency situation returned to normal.”
In this way, the number of unprocessed claims processes has been reduced by 22%.
Almost 57,000 of these cases were resolved resolved, 75% more than the previous year.
However, 81,500 claims remain outstanding.
Fighting this costs a lot of money
As is often the case in China, the numbers are staggering.
Last year the CTMO registered more than 1.4 million trademark protection applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
This would be a new record and means that China leads the list of new entries worldwide for the tenth year in a row, according to the trademark office.
It seems that this also happens with the number of valid logos, a figure that amounts to 5.5 million in total.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan would have been pocketed in rights.
Put another way, this means that on average each registration costs 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.
Fighting this costs a lot of money, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years the group has been fighting in court against a Chinese imitator.
While the Germans have managed to stop the illegal manufacture of imitation car parts,
the imitator has managed to secure the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
“We ourselves have caused this situation because in Germany surnames are not protected,” says Hanno Wentzler, President and CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO trademark office also dismissed the appeal of the Munichers.
In the next two instances they have agreed with Freudenberg, but the opposite side continues to fight today.
You have to be very careful
Now the case has reached the doors of the High Court of Justice, where it remains pending resolution.
Wentzler is confident that he can resolve the issue favourably and praises the professionalism of the courts.
However, he also states that “the procedure is extremely expensive, both in terms of money and time.”
It is difficult to estimate internal costs; the business archive has had to review files up to 100 years old in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg offered the opposing party a "six-figure sum in euros" with the aim of reaching an amicable settlement, but it was unsuccessful.
“This shows how much we care,” Wentzler says.
The dangers lurking in the Far East even threaten to affect Europe,
specifically if the imitators secure there the rights to unprotected marks.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer tried to register in Germany the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products.
The group has long since left this commercial field, but managed to prevent registration.
“You have to be very careful,” Wentzler says.
Both he and attorney Pattloch recommend that German companies be extremely cautious when doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark law, but what must be done is "to register also in China everything that can be protected", as Wentzler points out.
Otherwise, the subject can be much more expensive than a simple registration.
In fact, should Freudenberg lose the last round of his particular battle, then he would have to pay the opposing party license fees for his own name, as Wentzler explains.
That or in the segment in question would drive us out of the market.
World AIDS Day: Dancing, Singing, Helping
Imbongi Choir Rehearses in Heidelberg, AIDS Orphans Rejoice in Swaziland
The story of a link capable of overcoming much more than 8,733 kilometers away.
First you start with the dance: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, high heels and moccasins look for the compass on the parquet floor, and they quickly find it.
One, two, three, four.
Only then do the singers’ voices slowly begin to rise (contralto, bass, tenor and soprano), swirling, numbing and following each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old director, threatens to almost get out of his box by trying to put order with his energetic and gentle gestures.
It is Monday afternoon and in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg the choir Imbongi rehearses a new song.
The fifty singers, aged between 23 and 69, have also arrived, from the human geneticist to the master of the house.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each choir voice has a different text and also in a barely known foreign language: Zulu, a language spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some areas of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
According to an estimate by UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS programme, there are approximately 34 million people infected with HIV worldwide.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
There are 245,000 AIDS orphans in Swaziland.
More than 40% of the population is already HIV-positive.
The Voices for Africa association has found sponsors in Germany for the 180 AIDS orphans of the village of Esitjeni.
Seventy of them attend high school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can sponsor a child.
This contribution will cover school tuition, uniform and will guarantee you a hot meal a day at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means "storyteller" or "panegirist" in Zulu.
In this room, no one knows how to speak this Bantu language fluently, but they do know how to sing.
For ten years this choir has been rehearsing songs in this soft foreign language that sometimes manages to transport them to their place of origin: southern Africa.
8,733 kilometers away in a straight line from Heidelberg, in the northeast of the kingdom of Swaziland, there is a village called Esitjeni that depends on the voices of this German choir.
Forty percent are infected.
Approximately 2,000 people live there, some still in simple mud and straw huts, a large part of them children.
More than 300 no longer have parents because they have succumbed to AIDS.
Esitjeni is a small example of what affects Swaziland: the highest rate of AIDS infection and the lowest life expectancy worldwide, according to Unicef.
The population does not take kindly to circumcision, a practice that has been shown to halve the risk of contagion.
More than 40% of Swaziland’s inhabitants are carriers of the immunodeficiency virus, and dying at just over thirty has become commonplace.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005 the choir discovered this hidden population, but what they saw above all were many children on the streets who lacked not only the protection of their parents, but the main thing: food, clothing and training.
Without a school diploma, the chances in a poor country are more than slim.
In the beginning it was only the particular commitment of a few that made it possible for a child to go to school and enjoy a hot meal a day. All this for a few euros.
However, a year later the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa" which since then has professionally cared for AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about Sexually Transmitted Infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STDs include syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea.
The most common STDs of viral origin are AIDS, human papillomavirus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Slats and scabies are among the STDs transmitted by parasites.
What are the main groups of people affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea occur most often in men who have sex with other men.
The Robert Koch Institute assumes that at least four out of every five cases of syphilis recorded in Germany have their origin in sexual contact between men.
In the case of heterosexual adults, the most common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia, trichomonas, human papillomavirus, candidiasis (fungus) and gonorrhea.
HIV transmission among heterosexual adults in the country is relatively low; however, approximately 20% of new HIV infections occur in this group.
Among young people, chlamydia infections are much more common than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In our country, the human papilloma virus is also added to the most common diseases among youth.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory reporting.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been on a downward trend since 2007.
Approximately 2,700 cases were reported in 2011.
This is one tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate that it is a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause sores in the genital area, discomfort when urinating, discharge, abdominal pain, as well as blisters or warts.
They often do not cause pain or other symptoms and are therefore not detected.
How can one be protected?
Condoms can reduce the risk of contagion, but they do not offer 100% protection.
Some pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through dirt and physical contact infections.
For this reason, experts recommend regular medical examinations, especially if you change your sexual partner frequently.
If diagnosed early, most STDs can be cured and any late consequences can be avoided.
Through collaborations, donations and, last but not least, the fees that the choir charges for its performances throughout Germany, they come to raise quite a bit of money.
“In total, we have already sent some 200,000 euros to Esitjeni,” says Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a confident woman with leadership skills, manages the money sent from Germany.
She takes care that orphans find a good accommodation, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The "gogos", as older women are called in Zulu, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans in their care, offer them a home to live in and ensure that children come to school every day on time and dressed in their uniforms.
Those who have no one are left under the protection of Khanyisile, a single woman who, like the two cooks who are in charge of cooking every day for more than 200 hungry children, receives a salary from the association.
In addition, "Voices of Africa" has set up a sewing school, built two chicken coops and, in collaboration with the American health organization PSI, has managed to get many of the inhabitants of the village tested for HIV.
This is not obvious, since, despite how obvious this disease is throughout the country, it is not usually spoken about openly.
A king with 14 wives
“AIDS is an absolute taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it has to do with sexuality.”
Something strange in a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his opulent and over-indulgent lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This officially unaccepted way of life is largely responsible for the rapid spread that the HIV virus has experienced in recent decades.
But it is also due to the countless seasonals who travel the country from one side to the other and who take it wherever they go.
According to Annette Lennartz, “free condoms can be found in every corner, but they are hardly used.
It’s another culture, here they only accept skin-to-skin contact.”
To foster cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels every two to three years through southern Africa singing songs that speak of melancholy, fighting spirit, hope and confidence in the black race, songs that many in the southernmost tip of the African continent still remember from the apartheid era.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language; so much recognition not only brings with it an excellent atmosphere and a lot of joy, but it has also managed to wring a couple of tears from some rabid border soldier.
The trip always takes them to Ezitjeni, where the singers visit the sponsored children.
Although this small population hardly appears on maps, in the Ezulweni River valley it is well known.
"Draw closer to Esitjeni, there the light shines," says the locals.
And after traveling the 8,733 kilometers in a straight line back to Heidelberg to the rehearsal rooms of Bergheimer Street full of singers marking the passage, one realizes that it is also possible to see their light shine from there.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The Messenger spacecraft has found evidence of ice on Mercury.
The ice sheet is probably up to 20 meters thick.
NASA, the US space agency, has provided evidence of the existence of ice on Mercury.
Despite being the closest planet to the sun, there is also ice water, as shown by three studies published Thursday in the specialized journal "Science".
The MESSENGER probe has found evidence that an ice sheet has formed in the area of the planet that is permanently in shadow.
It seems to be at least 30 centimeters and probably even up to 20 meters thick.
The water comes presumably from comets or, most likely, asteroids that once collided with Mercury.
No one is linking the finding of ice to the possibility of life on the planet, says Messenger's lead researcher Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help shed light on how water and other components of life have reached other parts of the solar system.
Inadvertently for the inhabitants of planet Earth, probes, telescopes and small robots like the Phoenix are dedicated to exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send images to Earth: small windows into the vastness of space.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets that make up our solar system, in addition to the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which revolves around the sun just behind Neptune, according to the new definition of the term published by the International Astronomical Union in 2006 Ceres is no "planet".
This section of an infrared image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" in which infinite generations of stars appear: the oldest stars are shown as blue dots, although the most difficult to recognize is the pink color of the "newborn" stars.
This star-forming region, unromantically named by W5 scientists, was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6,500 light-years.
This tornasoled image of an extinct star was taken by NASA's Spitzer telescope.
The donut-shaped ring is composed of material that the star spits out in its extinction process.
In the huge Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, new stars are formed from gas and dust.
NASA’s Spitzer telescope took this photo of the galactic star formation zone.
The Pleiades, a group of stars also known as the Seven Sisters, are an object visible to the naked eye in the night sky.
However, with the telescope you can better appreciate the colors.
The Helix Nebula appears as a huge red eye appears in this infrared image.
It is located 700 light-years from the constellation Aquarius.
Its similarity to a terrestrial continent has earned it the nickname North America.
The combination of a normal photograph and an infrared image gives rise to a spectacular color.
This budding star could be captured in all its glory for the first time by Spitzer's infrared detectors.
Saturn and its rings: how they originated remains one of the great unknowns of astronomy.
They are probably the remains of one of Saturn's moons that disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and sharpest pictures taken by the Hubble telescope: the Swirl Galaxy.
Depending on the hues, some images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image released by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula located several thousand light-years away in the constellation Sagittarius.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin term "trifidus" (divided into three), since dark dust lines divide the hot heart of this star-forming zone into three lobes.
In the constellation of Ophiuchus, astronomers were able to photograph the signs of a cosmic carambola: 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two merging galaxies rush towards each other to end up colliding irretrievably.
This star formation was captured by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who do not like technical abbreviations can refer to it with the nickname of Molinillo Austral.
The Hubble Space Telescope image shows a section of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
The nebula located 1,400 light-years away is composed of dust particles whose size is between ten and a hundred times smaller than that of the dust particles that we can find in a house.
This image was created from optical images and x-rays taken by different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes located 430 million light years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, served for a moment as a model for NASA's Hubble Space Telescope.
Scientists call it the largest spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
In this nebula lies the brightest cluster of young stars in our Milky Way.
This area of star formation constantly produces new stars.
In this cloud of stars, associated with the Rosette Nebula, new stars are also continuously emerging; 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this galaxy so bright with a small black hole there is still no dust, only gas.
The researchers assume that it formed shortly after the big bang, when hydrogen could be found mostly in the universe.
Our window to the universe: the most important telescopes
It seems that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have not stopped growing and the images they offer us are increasingly deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest in the world.
His mirror, in the image, had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, stands the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows you to observe the cosmos through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias located on the island of La Palma is huge - only the mirror has a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
In spite of this, it reaches a diameter of about eleven meters.
The drawback of this more economical construction is that the telescope has a fixed elevation angle, so its mobility is limited.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas also has a fixed elevation angle.
Its particularity is its enormous ability to collect light.
Despite having a comparatively smaller mirror diameter, this capacity is comparable to that of the world’s largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of the Arecibo radio telescope (Puerto Rico) researchers can explore the universe in search of signs of extraterrestrial life.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) can help anyone who owns a computer, providing processing capacity.
A view of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here stands the Very Large Telescope, a telescope that lives up to its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can also illuminate the mid-infrared spectrum.
ESO will also host the so-called E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope).
Its primary mirror will span 42 meters and will be composed of a total of 1,000 reflective elements.
Until 2018 it is not expected to be able to take pictures.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes located on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
These have two mirrors, each with a diameter of 10 meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which along with them explores the sky with the help of the Subaru Telescope and the IRTTF.
On Mauna Kea it is planned to build a new telescope of enormous proportions and with a mirror diameter of thirty meters.
This is a picture of what it would be like.
However, the most important information about the cosmos comes from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, it has been sending images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets, mainly those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1,235 planet candidates had been located since the start of its mission.
The image shows the final preparations before the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not launch into space aboard an Ariane 5 rocket until 2018.
The primary mirror of this space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the functions of this telescope will be to search for the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the big bang.
The researchers assume that at Mercury's south pole there is also ice.
However, there is no reliable evidence, since the Messenger probe revolves around the planet in an orbit much closer to the north pole.
For decades, radar measurements have pointed to the existence of ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger probe (2004), the first to orbit Mercury, scientists are now certain that it is so.
Drink butter daily and live 168 years

A search for footprints in a country where 97-year-olds are still considered young.
The tour of the Talysh mountain region could be described as wild and romantic.
The minibus roars through the winding road that runs alongside forested hills, high-flowing rivers and the simple homes of local farmers.
Everything is green and juicy, one might even think it lies in the Black Forest.
However, we are in the southernmost part of Azerbaijan; from here the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here live the Talyshi, a people of which not much is known, apart from that they perfectly dominate the Persian and the Azeri and that they are very long-lived.
Our final destination is Lerik.
This small town boasts perhaps too massive architecture designed in the Soviet era and that does not seem to fit quite into such a picturesque mountainous landscape.
European tourists hardly reach this place, as the road from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is too heavy.
To travel the 323 kilometers that separate both urban centers, it takes eight hours because the road is one-way.
The astonishing wealth enjoyed by the country thanks to the oil of the Caspian Sea has not yet reached this remote region.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what it takes to become a tourist attraction.
“Baku became famous in May on the occasion of the Eurovision Song Contest and next year we will celebrate the Festival of the world’s oldest people,” says Fatulayeva.
This is the director of the Museum of Longevity, perhaps the only one that exists in the world.
Here is documented the life of eight dozen talyshis of the place who have exceeded 100 years of age. Fatulayeva points to a black and white image.
This is my grandfather, who lived 120 years.
One of his sons died at the age of 136.
However, the undisputed star of the museum is sheep herder <0xC5><0x9E>irali M<0xC3><0xBC>sl<0xC3><0xBC>mov, who seems to have lived 168 years.
However, there is no birth certificate that certifies this.
And if we take into account that the oldest documented man lived 122 years, it seems that M<0xC3><0xBC>sl<0xC3><0xBC>mov’s age is quite suspicious.
“He was born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973,” Fatulayeva explains.
The man was married three times and had 23 children, and apparently still had time to conceive another daughter at the age of 136.
Was <0xC5><0x9E>irali M<0xC3><0xBC>sl<0xC3><0xBC>mov wrong then in his age in a couple of decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard about the advanced age of this Central Asian inhabitant.
"In some regions of China, Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan there are also very old people," Scholz says, "even in Sardinia there are many older men."
Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence about age, especially when there is no civil registration.
Every day glasses full of melted butter
It is a fact that, surprisingly often, the inhabitants of the region around Lerik often reach a biblical age.
There are currently 20 people over 100 years of age.
Why do so many elderly people live here in the south?
Azeri tour guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that these are the special genes of the talyshis.
The director of the museum, Mrs. Fatulayeva, believes instead that the cause lies in food.
However, from a nutritional point of view, it does not seem logical that precisely the high-calorie diet of the Talyshi, who love meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of whom, in addition, drink a glass of melted butter daily, is so healthy.
Or is it perhaps the natural way of life that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a small settlement not far from the town of Lerik lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At 97 years of age, he is relatively young for what is stylized by these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 children, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
Sitting on the floor, she tirelessly moves a huge tub of butter.
Eight people live under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva’s sons and a daughter, both of whom became grandparents long ago.
They also jump from one side to the other two small children.
In the kitchen they prepare tea for the guests, a tea that they serve in typical domed glasses.
Mirzayeva’s teeth are white and perfectly aligned and under the handkerchief she hides two long braids of dark blonde hair that her son proudly discovers for us.
I have always washed my hair with milk, so it has never fallen out and has maintained its color.
“I’ve never used a shampoo either,” says Mirzayeva.
The pension is enough to live on.
He has always eaten only what he produced on his own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
In all my life I have never been to a supermarket.
Then she tells us about her husband, who was in the army.
The worst was the post-World War II era.
However, everything went back to its course when the "dear father", Heydar Aliyew, took control of the situation.
This kind of propaganda sounds strange in the mouth of an older woman.
In Azerbaijan, however, the cult of the father figure of the nation, who runs his country like a dictator, knows no bounds.
He remained in power until 2003, when he gave the witness to his son Ilham.
At least the elderly people of Azerbaijan do not know what poverty is.
Mirzayeva charges 230 manat (about the same amount in euros) as a monthly pension, an amount with which one can live well considering the situation here.
And perhaps Mirzayeva’s gray-haired son is right: “in our culture the elderly are highly respected.”
They live in a big family, they are loved, they receive all the necessary care and they are happy.
As if this wasn't reason enough to stay alive for many years...
The term “human rights” is missing from the Constitution.
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Demonstrations rivalling each other in Cairo underscore the country’s divisiveness.
The future constitution, with sharia law as its basis, is highly controversial.
The Egyptian president did not skimp on pathos.
“We have to get through the transition.
And for that to happen is my responsibility, to the people and to God,” he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, especially the Christian Copts, the liberals, the enlightened Muslims and the seculars.
All of them, hopelessly plunged so far into a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a theocracy on the banks of the Nile by the grace of the powerful Muslim community.
As Mohammed Morsi explains, almost asking for forgiveness, he has had to temporarily annul the powers of the Constitutional Court and expand his own “in order to save the revolution”.
However, neither Egyptians nor the entire world know very well what this 61-year-old engineer with a PhD degree awarded by the University of Southern California really wants to save.
Do you intend to deprive the judiciary of its power?
In fact, the 234 articles, whose approval has been forced by a constituent assembly composed of 100 predominantly Islamist members in a 15-hour nightly meeting, are truly troubling.
As in previous constitutions, the draft also says that the jurisprudence is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
What do you mean by “principles”?
This was and remains open to interpretation and it seems that Islamists will take advantage of this vague formulation, as well as the legal leeway it carries, to impose a stricter interpretation of sharia.
This is at least what is suggested by a new article added: in all matters relating to sharia it is mandatory to consult Al-Ashar University, the most important Islamic institution in the country with great power in all Sunni Islam.
It doesn’t have to be that way, but this may mean that the clergy would control the legislation, something that – in fact – would result in the incapacitation of the judiciary.
Much of the draft constitution is open to interpretation.
What is also problematic is that it seeks to maintain military jurisdiction.
During Mubarak’s dictatorship these courts served to exert harsh repression on the opposition.
After the fall of the dictator up to 11,000 civilians were detained in military prisons.
As the draft states, the state must protect “the true essence of the Egyptian family” and “promote its morals and values.”
It is such an imprecise formulation in legal terms that with the help of this article state institutions could even control the contents of cinematography and literature.
To be clear, this is nothing more than censorship.
Of course, no article explicitly establishes equality between men and women.
On the other hand, another prohibits offending or slandering the Prophet Muhammad and his legates.
However, it is not clear what an offence is and how it should be punished.
Equally dubious is the wording that prohibits "offense to people"
Is a caricature of the president or a joke about a lawyer enough?
A question of interpretation, like many other things in the draft that has been submitted to Morsi for his signature and that, according to his words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians to be submitted to referendum.
"The Revolution is Back"
For weeks the opposition has been closing ranks against the superiority of the Islamists.
Ten thousand people gathered in unusual harmony on Friday afternoon in Tahrir Square and vowed to scrap the act before it could take effect.
“The revolution has returned and we will end up winning,” said Hamdin Sabbahi, who is third on the list for the presidential election.
The Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, declared that the draft constitution should be “in the dustbin of history.”
On Twitter, he accused Morsi's followers of wanting to lead a "coup against democracy."
"When he calls for a referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," opposition leader Jasser Said said.
“We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers has not yet been expiated,” Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Chaled Ali as saying.
And several judges announced that they did not wish to oversee the referendum, so it would not be considered valid.
"The Qur'an is our Constitution"
For its part, the well-organized Muslim community called for a counter-demonstration, not in Tahrir Square, but after a prayer on the other side of the Nile, in front of Cairo University.
Many veiled women and supporters of the Salafists took part in it to the cry of: "the people demand the application of the divine law."
They demanded Morsi "cleanse the country", while proclaiming: "the Koran is our constitution".
A struggle for the sovereignty of the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all began, would have provoked a situation similar to that of a civil war.
It is clear that Morsi’s supporters did not want to risk something like this happening.
The Muslim brothers claimed that both those opposed to the draft constitution and supporters of it would have expressed their views loud and clear.
Now would have been the time to let the people decide at the polls which direction the country should go in.
In this sense, it seems that the draft of the Islamists is guaranteed the majority.
"The expression 'Human Rights' does not even appear"
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious with this forced constitutional process that should actually have lasted until February and have included all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers when they were held in prison or faced trial during Mubarak’s dictatorship.
Not because he shared his ideology, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
For this reason he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
“And now the expression ‘Human Rights’ does not even appear in the new constitution,” he laments in a conversation with the newspaper “Welt am Sonntag.”
The extension of Morsi’s powers to the three powers of the state caused this lawyer to resign.
The measures taken are flagrant violations of the rules of the democratic game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
“Instead of strengthening civil society, what the president has done is abolish it,” Saeda laments.
However, democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels abandoned, also by the international community, which observes the ideological struggle that is taking place on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could backfire on you.
A protester in Tahrir Square warns: “You are conceiving a monster that you cannot control.”
The Norwegian rakfisk: the smelliest fish in the world?
Norway’s five million inhabitants enjoy one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe but in the world.
Is it possible that the country’s success has anything to do with its avidity for an extremely foul-smelling fish?
Take a number of over-cured cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a mountain of dirty, damp football clothes.
Leave it there for a week.
Then you can smell the paralyzing aroma of rakfisk, one of Norway’s delicacies.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
The landscape is spectacular and that smell, always present, floats in the air.
The rakfisk is salted trout that is left to ferment in water for, depending on how foul-smelling you prefer it, up to a year.
As it gets darker and colder, Norwegians flock to a festival held here, in Fagernes, dedicated to this most, so to speak, captivating delicacy.
“You eat raw and then you drink a glass of aquavit from a drink,” says Havard Halvarsen, a city firefighter who is also known as the “Rakfisk General,” who is in charge of organizing the festival.
Everywhere we see people eating this fish that is kept in small cubes and drinking from a drink significant amounts of the drink.
“Some people like aquavit more than rakfisk,” says Havard.
Drinking can kill the smell.
I try some pieces.
If you can avoid passing it close to your nose, it’s not bad; it’s not much different than a portion of sushi that has traveled a few kilometers by bus.
Rakfisk is a product that comes from a very different time, in which poverty struck Norway and in which, before refrigeration existed, fish was kept during the autumn submerged in water and salt in airtight barrels.
Later, in the middle of winter, when it is already well fermented, it is taken out and, evidently with the senses inactive due to alcohol, it is eaten.
Just a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, and emigrated mainly to the United States.
Currently, the population is increasing rapidly; more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high wages and a complete system of social services.
A stream of Swedish people, the old rival and even not much richer than Norway, comes to this country to work.
Rakfisk is considered an important, if rather smelly, part of Norway’s past.
It is among the most expensive dishes you can buy.
But, in fact, everything is expensive. A cane of beer or a sandwich cost you a whopping 10€ ($14) each.
Norway does not usually appear on the international news agenda and most Norwegians like it that way.
Here people are still reluctant to pronounce the name of Anders Breivik, the far-right racist who shot and killed 77 people, including men, women and children.
Instead, they refer to the shooting as “the July 22 event.”
It is very hard for the Norwegians to believe that in their peaceful country one of their own was capable of committing such cruelty and murder.
Behind much of Norway’s current wealth is the growth, since the early 1970s, of one of the world’s largest oil and gas industries.
“But oil isn’t the only reason we’re doing so well,” says Anna, our waitress, as she passes rakfisk trays and, with her long blonde hair and striking blue eyes, represents the image of Norwegian well-being.
“We are, as you say, wise people.”
Her English, like most people in this country, is impeccable.
“We don’t like bragging, we don’t like ostentation.”
Norway has managed its oil wealth very cautiously; everything, except a small percentage of the money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
While everyone was wasting money they didn’t have during the years leading up to the worldwide financial crisis, Norway kept the wallet tightly closed.
“As long as we can ski in winter and hike in summer, we’re happy,” says Anna.
"And eat rakfisk," he adds with a cheeky laugh.
I’m in the snow queuing for something to eat; I’ve had enough rakfisk.
Now a moose burger is certainly something different and quite succulent to savour.
But at night, that stinky fish comes back.
The hotel I stay in is one of the many places where a rakfisk dinner is held in which diners vote for the best fish, or perhaps the one that most tests the nostrils.
A television has connected live with a presenter who wears a bow tie and is surrounded by dishes of rakfisk.
It looks like the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What are your scores for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here's our score, Havard."
There is laughter and applause.
A man falls from his chair, perhaps beaten by the aquavit.
Or maybe it's the fumes from all that fish.
Mexico: Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto faces a tough start
As Mexico’s incoming President Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto prepares to take office, BBC correspondent Will Grant looks at the challenges the new president will face and the different expectations of his people.
Traffic in Mexico City is especially bad these days.
In a city that, in the best circumstances, is already congested, a steel fence has been installed since Monday that cuts several of the main roads leading to the city and is causing enormous chaos on the roads.
The aim, however, was not to prevent workers from reaching their workplace, but to prevent protesters from reaching parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico’s new president, Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto, will receive the presidential band and take over the nation’s management.
He faces a complicated task.
Mexico has been getting good economic results during the outgoing government of Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, but the country is immersed in a war against drug trafficking that has already claimed about 60,000 lives in six years.
“My administration has a great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence,” Mr. Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto explained earlier this week to U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office.
“I’m going to propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve that goal.”
Before he rubbed shoulders with the U.S. president, Mr. Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a’s previous political experience was as governor of his home state of Mexico.
A heavily populated and rapidly growing state, it surrounds the capital; opinions about the new leader are divided on this territory in which he used to move.
A sincere man
In the bucolic city of Valle del Bravo, for example, he is fondly remembered.
Its residents attribute to it the merit of the growth of tourism in the place and the construction of infrastructures.
To get to the city you can drive on one of the new roads of Mr. Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto, which is a huge improvement compared to the cracked and bumpy roads that were rehabilitated.
Plaques with his name can also be seen at the entrance to a modern sports complex and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
“We are confident that he will achieve real and lasting change,” says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernández, a deputy from Mr. Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto’s party, the PRI.
“Particularly, in terms of security and the economy, we look forward to the interesting and real change that our country so badly needs.”
After an uninterrupted period of 81 years in power, the PRI was ousted by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Deputy Olvera admits that, after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are many expectations within the party regarding Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto.
It also rejects the opposition’s assessment of the new president’s lack of substance.
"He is a very sincere man, very committed and with an excellent vision of the country.
He’s a fantastic statesman and, above all, he’s a person who can listen.”
However, on the other side of the state that is not the impression that many people have about their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
Hidden under elevated stretches of highway is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems of the municipality are also hard and urban.
Earlier this year, the military was asked to intervene to help in the fight against drug gangs operating in neighborhoods and violence against women is especially serious.
In a desert plot, next to a garbage dump, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left abandoned in just the last two years.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto was governor, a much higher rate than that of Ciudad Juarez, unfortunately famous for its violence and a place that is synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
Mr. Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto’s critics say, at best, that he failed to address the problem of femicide while in office.
The most critical accuse his administration of turning a blind eye.
In a concrete house, typical of the deteriorated neighborhood, Irinea Buend<0xC3><0xAD>a has to make efforts to contain tears while showing me photographs of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes her partner murdered her.
“When I arrived at his house, it seemed as if his body had been cleaned,” Ms. Buend<0xC3><0xAD>a recalls.
“There were signs that she had been beaten and rigor mortis had already appeared.”
As her mother recounts the story, a photograph of Mariana looks down from the walls, next to a cross that reads a single word: Justice.
However, that is exactly what the family says he has been denied.
“The state authorities have treated me as if I were an old gossip, a troublemaker, a complainer.
What they want is for you to just accept what they say and shut up.”
“But that can’t be the case when there have been so many irregularities and so much negligence,” he says.
The presidential band that President Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto will receive on Saturday will be accompanied by an enormous responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has vowed to give them priority during his term.
“I hope he will be the same kind of president he was when he was governor,” says PRI deputy Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
However, that is precisely what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear the most.
Bradley Manning did not report abuse, prosecutors say
Prosecutors try to address allegations of abuse by Bradley Manning during his time in prison
The trial focuses on Manning’s time in Virginia’s Quantico Military Prison.
The defense wants the case dismissed on the grounds that Manning's incarceration was severe.
The army soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors sought to prove Friday that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leak of confidential information in U.S. history, missed multiple opportunities to report the mistreatment he now alleges he suffered while in military detention.
During questioning of Manning at a pretrial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Attorney General Commander Ashden Fein claimed that records of the weekly visits of unit officers Manning received during nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, show no complaints about his treatment.
The interrogation, which took place during a hearing following the defence ' s request that the case be dismissed on the grounds that his incarceration had been harsh and that it had already amounted to sufficient punishment, came a day after Manning had testified that he had planned to commit suicide while in detention.
The army intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while on duty in Iraq.
Later, WikiLeaks published the material on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of the information.
At Friday’s hearing, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms officers filled out after visits to Manning during his arrest at Quantico Military Prison, where he was held in maximum confinement from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers would have asked Manning questions and written down his answers.
When Fein asked about the forms on Friday, Manning acknowledged that he had called the treatment given to him by the caretakers “excellent” and the treatment received at the facility in general “very professional.”
The forms do not show any reports of ill-treatment, even though officers asked Manning directly about the treatment he was receiving, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed concern about some issues and that visiting officers had spoken to him about those issues and indicated that they would be dealt with, but that they had not recorded those issues in the register.
“They wrote ‘no issues’ (after I had talked about the issues) but this doesn’t necessarily mean I wouldn’t have mentioned any issues,” Manning said.
The judge, Army Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why she had not denounced the treatment she was receiving during the January 2011 meeting with a council tasked with examining suicide intentions that she had expressed on a form months earlier.
Manning responded that his intention during that meeting was to get the reduction of the “injury prevention” regime under which he was.
The military said it had put him under that restrictive regime, which is one degree below surveillance for possible suicide, to ensure his protection and the safety of others.
“I wanted the staff to know that I was okay and [wanted] to stop being under injury prevention ... so that I could enjoy what, in my view, is a better quality of life,” Manning said.
Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being moved to the military prison at the Marine base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he had considered suicide in Kuwait and on one occasion lost consciousness due to the heat.
He said that the fact that he was not allowed to know what was happening to him or what was happening in the outside world was very distressing.
“My world was reduced to just Camp Arafjon, to that cage,” Manning explained Thursday.
“I thought I was going to die in that cage.”
Manning claimed that, once moved to Quantico, he spent most days in a small cell, at least for 21 hours and often for 23 hours, unaccompanied.
Manning said he was only allowed to have a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, some clothes and his glasses.
He explained that he tried to move all the time, as it was forbidden to sleep or even lie down during the day.
Manning claimed that he always had a light from outside pointing to his eyes as he slept.
He said that if the guards couldn’t see his face when he turned around at night, they would wake him up to turn around again.
Manning’s lawyer filed a formal complaint in January 2011 about Manning’s treatment.
Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth Military Prison in Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge asked Manning about an allegation she had made in Thursday’s statement that, after being forced one night to sleep naked in her Quantico cell, she was forced during a morning recount to stand naked in front of the guards and other inmates.
Manning had testified that he had never been given the opportunity to cover himself with the blanket during the recount.
During the judge's questioning Friday, Manning said she inferred from the watchman's order that she should drop the blanket she could have covered herself with, but acknowledged that no one had ordered her to drop it.
Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before because of an attempt to prove to an officer that he posed no danger to himself.
Manning said he had told the officer he could have used the elastic on his underwear or flip-flops to self-harm but had not.
Manning testified that his underwear, flip-flops and glasses had been removed from his cell that night.
His lawyers are hopeful that the judge will at least take into account the experiences he went through during his time in prison and drastically reduce his sentence should he be convicted at the court-martial, which is scheduled to begin early next year.
The defense said it plans to have Manning plead guilty to misdemeanors and defend other charges deemed too extreme.
The hearing is expected to resume this weekend and prosecutors are expected to argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has maintained that Manning was held in accordance with the rules applying to any detainee who is in maximum custody in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include cooperating with the enemy, illegally provoking the publication of information on the Internet, leaking national defense information, and theft of property or public records.
If convicted of all charges, he could face life in prison.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis
Says many were forced to leave Mexico due to lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to criticize those who left; says they remember Mexicans from those difficult times
Navarrette comments that Mexican-Americans are caught between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had barely come down the esplanade and arrived at the immigration processing area and was already totally confused.
Signs showed the way to two queues: one for "Mexicans" and one for "Foreigners".
I sat there for a few seconds not sure where to go.
Growing up in Central California, I’ve been called “Mexican” all my life.
It’s ethnic shorthand, the same way my friends in Boston refer to themselves as “Irish” or my friends in New York call themselves “Italian.”
Later I decided on "Mexican-American".
But this was Mexico.
And, in my grandfather’s homeland, shorthand or scripts were not necessary.
He was simply an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to handle myself during an interview in this language.
But I don’t have the vocabulary level of a native and I can’t get rid of my American accent.
So I took my American passport and stood in line for foreigners.
I thought back to that moment this week when Mexican President-elect Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
The agenda of the day, as always when the leaders of these two countries meet, consisted of: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto was also keen to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons why right now a Mexican is as likely to stay in Mexico as he is to venture to the United States.
It wants to partner with the United States and Canada and create a European Union-style trading bloc in North America.
In addition, Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto promised to continue fighting drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not give details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of rancor.
Probably most Americans never remember that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to cede half of their territory at gunpoint.
But for Mexicans, who think in centuries, not minutes, the elements that remind them are everywhere.
So, the moment a U.S. official says anything that carries the slightest criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear complaints, both in the press and among the Mexican elite, about how Americans are usurping the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And the sons of Moctezuma put themselves on a war footing.
And yet, for Mexico, the relationship that really is a challenge is the one they have with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans who live in the United States.
Are we talking about grudges?
There's a lot.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for whom it does not.
The only reason there are so many people of Mexican descent living in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that, at some point in our family tree, there was a person, perhaps the father or mother or one of the grandparents, who was closed the door of opportunities in Mexico and had to march north.
And most of the time that person fit a certain profile: dark skin, a low level of education, coming from a poor town, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
Mexico is not.
And, even though we may be living the American dream now, having gone to good schools and had good jobs, we can never lose sight that what we are living is that, the American dream, and not the Mexican one.
Sometimes our identity may not be clear, but our loyalty is.
It's for the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many of the Mexicans belonging to the elite of the ruling class do not like us.
The feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look at us over the shoulder as if we were from an inferior category that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough and our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
In their view, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families had not failed in Mexico, they would not have left.
And now we would not find ourselves trapped behind this silk curtain, living well in the United States but still as lonely souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally came to the United States as a child, reminds me that there is this friction between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans because the former know more solidly who they are and the latter this bothers them.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she considers herself part of both countries.
Meanwhile, many Mexican-Americans I know feel they are not part of either.
We love to hear the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You have the best of each country, but you are not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico they see us as Americans.
In the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
Now, to further complicate matters, from what I have learned during my trip, some Mexican leaders and some intellectuals want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as improvised “ambassadors” of Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We would tell our fellow Americans how fantastic it is to visit that country and we would put pressure on political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yeah, sure.
That's not gonna happen.
There's too much rancor.
And, with wage inequality, rampant corruption and drug violence, many of us aren’t so sure it’s a fantastic country.
I'm afraid you're going to be left alone with this idea, friends.
That's fair.
If some Mexicans are still not prepared to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, then they have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans are still resentful of how their relatives were treated much less time ago.
Mm-hmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexican" than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas may well be an unlikely basis for peace.
Will there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain.
Amid the useless and usual discussions about who started first, piles of buildings have been reduced to rubble; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed and, for the first time, missiles from Gaza have fallen near Tel Aviv, Israel’s metropolis, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But, even though Israelis and Palestinians seem to be anchored in their old conflict, everything around them in the Middle East is changing.
The Arab Spring has left everything to pieces whether they like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have been caught up in the regional uproar.
Perhaps this will make their struggle even bloodier than before.
However, there is reason to believe that their deadly stalemate could be unblocked.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance, optimism currently seems very difficult to justify.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on Nov. 21 is maintained, this week’s clashes have bolstered hawks on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelis to withdraw, even though Gaza has been badly beaten.
And despite having killed some of its leaders and pressured Gaza’s 1.7 million inhabitants into one of the most miserable and populated corners of the planet, Israel has not been able to put an end to Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently ruled by its ruthless rivals from Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian faction.
Moreover, Hamas leaders might conclude that time is on their side.
Since Islamists have been gaining influence throughout the Arab world, Hamas has made rich and powerful friendships.
Turkey, a resurgent regional power that had previously been Israel’s closest Muslim ally, has embraced the cause of Hamas, as has Qatar, one of the Gulf’s wealthiest and most dynamic states.
Exultant Hamas members say the Islamist crescent is encircling Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where the Hezbollah militia-party dominates, to Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamist bent could topple Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies are threatening the king.
Especially on Israel’s southern flank, the growth of the Muslim Brotherhood led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and fundamental of Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, did not have much time for Hamas.
Instead, the Muslim Brotherhood is Hamas’s first cousin and its leaders are more reliant on popular opinion.
In future diplomatic actions, it is possible that Hamas will emerge as a protagonist that cannot be excluded, not even Israel and the United States.
In the meantime, Israel’s hard wing will draw the opposite conclusion.
As far as the military issue is concerned, they have put Hamas in its place.
Israel’s Iron Dome anti-missile system has proven its effectiveness and many of Hamas’ missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will sleep calmer... for some time.
As for diplomacy, the United States is stronger than ever; many European countries also blamed Hamas for initiating the latest wave of violence.
Above all, Israel has prospered, especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets fired from Gaza have killed some 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had too many suicide bombers, thanks in part to the barrier that corrodes the West Bank, the main piece of a territory aspiring to become a state of Palestine, and protects Jewish settlements that continue to rise despite being illegal under international law.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose Likud party has joined an even harder-line group led by Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to the Jan. 22 election, is in a good position.
Why pamper these twisted Palestinians by giving them a state of their own?
If they really ruled in the West Bank, wouldn’t they fire rockets just like their compatriots have done in Gaza?
It is better to have them behind that wall and give them a good punch if they raise their heads.
Perhaps the hard wing will prevail, although the Arab Spring could alter their calculations.
Even if the Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere do not have much appreciation for Israel, their priority will be to address the internal difficulties.
Israel’s defense budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors combined.
Starting a war with the area’s superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments improve their economies.
That the pragmatic Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama to get the ceasefire is a good omen and could mark the beginning of something.
Israelis, too, should think long-term.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving the Palestinians of their right to self-determination means creating a powder keg that will one day explode in Israeli-occupied territories, just as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state and demography worsens the situation as the Arab population increases.
The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to reject Hamas will pay an ever-increasing diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a push from people outside the conflict.
The solution remains the one preached by sensible people on both sides, most of the outside world and this newspaper: two states and the cession of territory by Israel for security reasons.
The hope, small in the short term, is that the ceasefire will give a little more momentum to outsiders who are fighting for this cause.
Egypt, which must begin curbing the entry of weapons into Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is in an unprecedented situation to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs outside the issue should also pressure Hamas and Fatah to join.
That would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the imminent attempt to obtain a virtual status category at the UN.
Mr. Obama also has an important role to play in getting Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term, he failed to present his own peace plan.
Back in the White House, he seems just as reluctant to devote his attention to her.
This attitude is a deplorable vision for the future.
A stable Middle East is of vital interest to the United States.
This implies a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine.
Generic tobacco packaging law goes into effect in Australia
Warnings about the risks of smoking and diseased body parts appear on green-off-white packets, which are the same for all brands of tobacco.
The Australian law on tobacco and generic packaging, a pioneer in the world, comes into force and replacing the logos and colors of the brands with a wrapper of a dull olive green, frightening images of body parts with diseases and representations of children and sick babies for being children of smoking parents.
With the exception of the various images and health warnings, the only difference between the boxes, mandatory since Saturday, are the names of the brands, all of them printed in a small font.
It is the world’s strictest regime applied to tobacco packaging.
The federal government of Australia claims that the goal is to deter young people from smoking by removing the traits that make this habit glamorous.
It relies on studies that show that if a person hasn’t started smoking before age 26, there’s a 99% chance they’ll never do it.
“You can see that children, even from a very young age, understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through its brand,” said federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies showing, for example, how girls related the logo of a crown to the idea of being a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and these changes will not affect the profits of multinationals too much, other countries are considering taking similar measures.
The tobacco industry has exerted enormous pressure against the law.
Tobacco companies said the law would encourage the black market in tobacco, in which cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible.
“The legislation will have serious unintended consequences,” said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco in Australia.
The amount of tobacco that counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will bring to sell on the streets of Australia will increase.
Other people say their business has benefited from the passage of the law.
Sandra Ha, of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family-owned company, said the demand for silicone mouthpieces and covers to cover up nasty package images had skyrocketed almost from scratch two months ago, when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a challenge to the law in Australia's Supreme Court.
Ms. Ha said that Zico had sold up to 6,000 units to wholesalers and was expecting more stock.
“It’s a good business for us.”
According to experts, the possible obstacle is the popularity of social networks among the demographic sector to which the plan is directed.
Following a string of Australian laws banning TV advertising and sports sponsorship and forcing most retailers to keep cigarettes out of sight, tobacco marketing has moved online.
Australia has banned internet advertising to local businesses and websites, but cannot restrict it to foreign sites.
“If you market tobacco and you only have this small window left to promote your products, the online space is the most compelling place to be,” said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noted an increase in reviews of brands from “ordinary citizens” posted on social networking websites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
One wonders if this is just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigars and has taken the trouble to make a video or if any marketing company is behind it all.
British American Tobacco of Australia said the industry is more focused on what the new rules mean than marketing.
The industry has even paid for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to reject the new rules; these countries are claiming to the World Trade Organization that they are unfairly restricting trade, even though none of these countries has a significant volume of trade with Australia.
The WTO is likely to issue a resolution in mid-2013.
Plibersek said the government had held talks with other countries that are considering implementing similar tobacco packaging laws.
In 2001, Canada became the first country to introduce the requirement to include images in packages.
They are currently mandatory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
In Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India, tougher laws are being considered.
In Australia many smokers are defiant.
“Photographs don’t affect me.
I just don’t listen to them.”
"You take the cigar and you put the package away," Victor El Hage says as he buys a package with a picture of a tumor in its mouth.
“Honestly, there’s only one reason I would quit smoking: because of my daughter.”
James Yu, manager of the King of the Pack tobacconist in central Sydney, says that uniform boxes make it more difficult for him to place them on shelves.
“It usually took an hour to unwrap a delivery; now it takes four,” Yu says.
“The government should have banned tobacco altogether and then, that’s it, okay, it’s over and we close the shop,” he says as he raises his hands up.
In a constantly connected world, it’s not so bad to get a little bored.
During the Thanksgiving holidays this year, I unexpectedly had to spend five hours at an airport because the plane we were flying on suffered a mechanical problem and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So I had plenty of time to think about boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spending half a day at an airport waiting for a flight to arrive is quite boring, even if you have the means to be entertained, such as books, magazines or iPhones, without forgetting duty-free shops.
But more and more academics and child development experts are praising the benefits of boredom.
According to them, it is okay that both we and our children get bored from time to time.
Getting bored forces the brain to look for interesting options and may encourage creativity.
Since most of us are currently connected to this or that screen, we don’t experience the benefits of boredom.
So, should we accept boredom in good spirits?
Oh, yeah.
And no.
But, we will talk about it later.
First of all, like many people, I assumed that now that we have more time for leisure, boredom would be a relatively recent phenomenon.
But, as Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of the book “Boredom: A Lively History” published in 2011 by Yale University Press, says, this is not the case.
“In fact, the history of boredom is very long,” he says.
On the walls of Pompeii there are graffiti in Latin about boredom dating back to the 1st century AD.
We must also consider how we define boredom.
“The problem is that it’s already been defined and discussed in a variety of ways,” says John D. Eastwood, a professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After reviewing the published research and pitching the idea to a 100-person focus group, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as the experience of “desiring, but not being able, to engage in an activity that fills you up.”
The difference between boredom and apathy is that the person doesn’t do something but wants to do it.
He points out that with apathy there is no desire to do something.
The main experience of boredom, he says, is “the alteration of the process of attention, associated with a low mood and a feeling that time passes slowly.”
Boredom can sound terribly similar to depression.
However, Professor Eastwood says that although they may be related, people who are bored tend to see the problem as a matter of the environment or the world, while people who are depressed consider the problem to be theirs.
Sometimes we think we are bored, when what really happens to us is that we have trouble concentrating.
In his study “The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention,” published in the September issue of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and colleagues referred to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape of a person reading a journal article.
Some groups listened in the adjoining room to a full-volume television program that had no connection, others listened to it with the volume low, so that it was barely noticeable, while the third group did not listen to the audio at any time.
The group that listened to the show with the low volume showed more boredom than the other two groups; they found it difficult to concentrate, but they were not sure why and attributed it to boredom.
“When you’re trying to focus on a difficult or interesting task, disturbance of attention can lead to boredom,” said Mark J. Fenske, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the study’s authors.
“On the other hand, when you’re doing something boring, like spotting faulty parts on a manufacturing line, distracting music can help keep you from getting bored.”
“In fact, we currently know that moving or doodling, actions that are often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can actually help combat it, as they make that person more physically alert.”
“Research shows that those children who are allowed to move learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to be still,” says Professor Fenske.
We all know what it’s like to get bored at some point: the delay of a plane, a monotonous speaker, an especially boring movie.
But some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To help measure it, some researchers developed in the 1980s a “boredom trend scale.”
The scale includes questions like “many of the things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous” and “there are so many things that interest me that I don’t have time to do everything.”
Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, says that using such scales, researchers have found that boys are more likely to get bored more often than girls, and specifically need more external stimulation and more varied.
But, in general, teenagers are a type of group that gets bored quite easily.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day through a search.
It found that 32 percent of teens said they get bored while at school or doing homework, while 23 percent said they get bored when not in school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether the current boredom rates, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he said what he did know was that “adolescence is a time when boredom is at its highest,” in large part because both kids and teens aren’t given a lot of control over what they want to do.
So, back to my question from the beginning: is it good to get bored?
Sometimes it is not, because, taken to the extreme, it can make us expose ourselves to absurd physical risks, such as betting or falling into the consumption of substances as a method to combat it, as research shows.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers talk about the connection between boredom and creativity, says Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying this issue for more than two decades.
“Boredom is the brain’s way of telling you that you should be doing something else,” says Gary Marcus, a psychology professor at New York University.
But the brain does not always know what is most appropriate.
If you’re bored and use that energy to play guitar or cook, that will satisfy you.
But if you watch TV, you may be satisfied in the short term, but not in the long term.
“So if your child is bored and you give them an iPad, they may not be bored anymore, but they won’t have learned to entertain themselves or dose themselves,” says Professor Fenske.
And “that ability to dose itself applies to other situations,” he says.
Not only does your child learn to entertain himself, but he learns to control himself better in other areas.
I don't think we really want to praise boredom.
But we shouldn’t be too critical of him either.
Our goal should be, rather, to feel comfortable away from the constant buzz of activities and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"In our view, we need to get bored more, but boredom is a desire too distressing and disturbing to relate to something worthwhile," he says.
He points out that what people are really looking for is a way to disconnect and enjoy a dead time.
“In an environment where we’re constantly overstimulated,” he says, “it’s hard to find ways to focus our attention when the noise stops.”
Colorado: No Instruction Book for New Marijuana Law
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old community college student and soccer player from southeastern Colorado, is facing criminal prosecution for something that will soon be legal statewide: possession of marijuana stones and a pipe he used to smoke it.
Orozco says that one day in September, he and some friends were driving through Lamar, on the plains near the Kansas border, when police stopped them.
Police found marijuana in the car and some time later Orozco received a subpoena for possession of drugs and related items (minor offenses each carrying a $100 fine) informing him of the date of the trial.
“They treat us like criminals,” Orozco says.
And they are?
In the weeks of uncertainty following Colorado’s vote to legalize the possession of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the answer in hundreds of minor drug possession cases depends less on the law than on location.
Hundreds of misdemeanor marijuana possession offenses are being overturned both here and in Washington state, where a similar measure was passed.
Police departments have stopped bringing charges against those over the age of 21 for small-scale possession, which will be legally approved once the law takes effect in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors from Colorado’s most conservative districts have pledged to move forward with marijuana possession cases and are still subpoenaing people.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains, are voting to prevent newly licensed marijuana shops from opening in their communities.
“All of this is changing so quickly that I don’t know what’s next,” said Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, just east of Denver.
Those in charge of regulations in Washington state are also turning the issue around.
And they continue to seek advice on establishing a system of production, manufacturing, distribution and sales licences, all before the deadline of 1 December 2013.
They say that, for better or worse, Colorado is ahead of most states in regulating marijuana use, first for therapeutic purposes and now for recreational use.
“Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide,” said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Washington State Alcohol Control Commission.
But Mr. Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions about what might work.
“There is no real precedent that serves as a model for us,” he says.
The Washington law, called I-502, takes effect on December 6, which also leaves a year during which you will swim between two waters, since the licensing system in that state will not yet exist, but the possession will be legal.
In addition, there are some delicate mechanical issues that need to be resolved during that period, such as how to maintain a balance between the state’s requirement to provide “adequate access” to licensed marijuana and its prohibition of conducting cannabis businesses within a radius of less than 300 meters from schools, parks, playgrounds or children’s centers.
“Nowhere will it be more difficult to locate a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the greater Seattle area,” says Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a newly created research group.
On November 21, Aurora police chief Oates sent an email to his police officers informing them that the city prosecutor would stop prosecuting people over the age of 21 for minor marijuana possession offenses and that the police would stop bringing charges against those offenses “with immediate effect.”
Police Chief Oates said they would enforce city regulations regulating the cultivation of marijuana for therapeutic purposes and would continue to pursue drug dealers and sellers.
In Weld County, in northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck represents a stricter view.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to prosecute marijuana possession cases, mainly to pressure consumers to decide to receive treatment.
Currently, 119 people face charges for possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many of them have other charges.
“Our office has an obligation to bring legal action against those offenses that at the time they occurred were offenses,” Mr. Buck said in a statement.
The response has been complicated even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana legalization initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the county’s largest city, no longer cite adults for possession of small amounts.
Pete Hautzinger, the county district attorney, supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss any of the pending possession cases.
"I don't think he's wasting his time in continuing to enforce the law until it changes," he said.
Even though 55 percent of voters supported the measure, it was never considered that bringing recreational marijuana use into the government and judicial system would be easy.
The contradictory reactions that arise throughout the state show a marked ambivalence among officials regarding the great ecological experiment in this state.
“It’s a cultural barrier with district attorneys,” says Sean McAllister, a Denver attorney who represents marijuana possession defendants and is a local spokesman for the National Organization for Marijuana Law Reform.
“They’ve spent so much time taking people to court that they can’t really accept that it’s legal yet,” he said.
As the first states to consider small amounts of marijuana in the same way as if it were alcohol, Colorado and Washington are preparing to become national test cases for drug legalization.
While attorneys and state officials have a new frontier of legal sales, they also look forward to receiving directions from the federal government, which still envisions considering the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Advocates of marijuana legalization are hopeful that the Justice Department will yield.
Although there have been some notable arrests of patients and sellers of marijuana for therapeutic purposes, the federal government has mostly allowed marijuana businesses to exist in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
“While anti-drug agents are unlikely to pull down doors to confiscate a small bag of drugs, they will likely be reluctant to allow the operation of state-regulated stores for the sale of marijuana for recreational use, permitted under the new law,” said Kevin A. Sabet, a former Obama administration drug policy adviser.
Several Colorado cities are not waiting for federal authorities to act.
Even before Election Day, some local governments approved moratoriums on any new marijuana stores, even though it will be about a year before any of them can open.
Last week, the western city of Montrose adopted a six-month ban and is likely to pass it next week.
“We don’t want to put ourselves in a situation where we authorize someone and then have a serious problem at the federal level,” said Bob Nicholson, a city council member.
“Our community voted against this amendment.
We are studying what the community voted for versus what the state voted for.”
A lot of questions arise about this.
Petronella Wyatt: 'I was bullied out of Oxford for being a Tory'
Don’t attack college students for their views just now
I don’t remember a time in my life when I didn’t dream of getting a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had been in what I assumed was the best place in the world to learn, a contemporary-era Greek symposium that fostered the two pillars of civilization: free thought and tolerance.
However, within two weeks of taking my place at Worcester College in the late 1980s to pursue a career in history, I had already packed my bags, which triggered the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and began to cry.
My friends were baffled.
The Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I had quit because I did not tolerate some college classmates having sex in the next room.
The writer A. N. Wilson jokingly announced that I had left because I was being forced to drink from peeled cups.
The truth was less fun.
I ran away from there.
Yes, I fled, because I had been subjected to systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of my fancy name, or the fact that I came from a private school.
I was harassed for only one reason, which in the cradle of the supposed illustration was somewhat intolerant and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a leading adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I supported the Conservative party.
You may be wondering what this is all about now.
Well, several reports indicate that a new generation of center-right students is suffering similar persecution.
The institutionalised and growing hatred of Conservative party students is such in Oxford that, last week, a group of them claimed the same level of equal rights as homosexuals, the disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of Corpus Christi College's JCR say they are "often seriously sidelined, personally attacked, and treated like unappreciated people" for their political views.
They want to create a position on their college’s equal opportunity committee to make sure they can express their opinions freely.
Their plight was not helped by a recent BBC2 documentary called "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" about student politics that portrayed the Tories as eccentric and neo-Nazi.
It showed graduate student Joe Cooke, former chairman of the Oxford University Conservative Party Association (OUCA), in a Rolls-Royce, wearing a silver suit and a cane with a silver handle.
At other universities, conservative students say they are treated as “Turkish heads” by the introduction of higher tuition fees.
Luke Black, a 20-year-old vice-president of the University of Nottingham’s Conservative Party Association, told a Sunday newspaper that “there is a growing trend of leftists in universities.
People assume we’re like the Bullingdon Club without even knowing each other.”
Samuel Roberts, a 21-year-old history student in Corpus Christi who filed the motion for greater protection, says this environment is “uncomfortable,” while Stephanie Cherill, a 19-year-old and OUCA president-elect, says the attitude of JCR members toward people who are center-right has worsened.
“This poses a threat to the environment of intellectual debate, as well as to the well-being of members,” he says.
During my first few weeks at Oxford I was more alone than one.
I entered college in September 1986, I was a terribly shy 18-year-old.
Hatred towards the Conservative Party was at its highest.
The previous year, the university had voted to deny Margaret Thatcher, a former student, an “honoris causa” degree following cuts in higher education funding.
The atmosphere would have made any Stalinist shudder with horror.
Already during the first days of the week of welcoming the new university students, when the new students meet and know the professors, I received a sample of the bitterness that awaited me.
I found that professors not only turned a blind eye to the mockery of conservative college students, but willingly participated in it.
The politics of the miners’ strike, privatization, and government opposition to anti-apartheid sanctions in South Africa reached as far as the seminary’s wooden halls.
The first one I attended had to be translated into English French texts of the eighteenth century and I was not prepared for what came next.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
Not one of them.
Pitt, a short man with a face that looked like cake dough, knew well how to expel mala bile.
“Do the Thatcherites refuse to learn French, or are they just fools?” he asked.
The other students laughed.
My eyes were burning with the tears I was trying to hold back.
“I suggest you go to French classes in your spare time, as long as you’re not too busy meeting people,” Pitt growled.
I returned to my room as a soul in grief.
That night I sat alone at dinner time in college; then I felt a slight pat on the back.
He was a second-year English student named James who introduced himself as a member of the OUCA.
“I know who you are,” he said kindly.
“I’m afraid that’s how it goes.
They mess with anyone who's suspected of being Tory.
For me it's very complicated, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so for you it will be even worse.
Many newly arrived Tories appear to be Labour.
Later, in a local pub, I tried cowardly to hide.
I insisted that I disagreed with everything Mrs Thatcher said.
That trick was useless.
A freshman in Philosophy, Politics and Economics who, paradoxically, had studied at Eton, said: “You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're contaminated."
Other students adopted that song.
I became the dirty pervert.
“How do the Tories have sex?” one asked.
“They beat each other up, don’t they?”
I felt the same way that homosexuals should have felt before the liberal law of the 1960s.
Could he one day lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to stay with people who think like me only after dark?
Should I become a laborer and repress my natural tendencies?
The three years that awaited me presented themselves as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only openly Tory professor was Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History assigned to my college.
He was hated for being not only a Conservative, but also a foreign policy adviser to Thatcher and one of the people who wrote her speeches.
He was barely there.
He detested the place because he considered it provincial and insignificant and because of its adherence to the Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997 he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
“You’re not going to be happy here,” he said.
I began moving daily from Oxford to my parents’ home in London, finding refuge in my more open-minded metropolitan family and friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
She didn't believe me.
When he studied there in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
“But it’s the best place in the world,” he said sadly.
“They would never do that, not there among my beloved dream needles.
Even my communist friends have always had an impeccable attitude."
His aching eyes began to cloud.
“Give him another chance.
I'm sure they did it just to joke.
It would break my heart if you left it."
Exhausted from so many trips to London, my emotional stamina was deteriorating.
A friend of mine, who also supported the Conservative Party, had succumbed to pressure and renounced his creed.
The following week, during a seminar in which another professor of History had hinted, quite seriously, that I was an “enemy of the people,” I decided to do the same.
Red with shame inside, I admitted that my parents had “brainwashed” me and called them “stupid old men.”
The truce lasted only a short time.
It was my father who put the last nail in the coffin of my college career at Oxford.
At that time my father wrote two weekly columns in Murdoch’s press.
My door was locked.
I was inside huddled in fear and, after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed my bags and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
Maybe you call me a weak crybaby.
But no 18-year-old should be subjected to such a level of intimidation and hostility in an educational institution.
What is even more tragic is that it was Oxford, which not only trained 14 Conservative Party prime ministers but, to this day, hides behind an undeserved reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Master of Sewing", which opened this week in London, ABC talks to Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian designer
Somerset House, former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer has recognized it during the inauguration of "Valentino: Master of Sewing", an apotheosisic retrospective that brings together more than 130 haute couture dresses created by his "maison" during the last 50 years.
“I love this palace,” he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the culmination of a story whose only protagonist is "il Signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his distinguished clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the rarefied and distant world of nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until March 3, private letters and photos abound with the signature of the most garnet of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino teaches those personal memories as trophies of his social ascent: from humble couturier in the northern Italian town of Voghera to idol of the international jet-set.
Being in love with royalty has nothing to do with it.
“At least they don’t turn off their cigarette butts on your magnificent carpet like some beautiful pop music celebrities do,” says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and entertains with generosity and elegance.
“We all loved being invited to their chalet in Gstaad,” explains the ex-wife of “Heini” Thyssen, intimate of forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And yet, she's a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza also does not forget the charisma of the couturier.
Many years ago, after a parade in Piazza di Spagna, in Rome, we went to his apartment for dinner.
We were twenty people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of the floor, the decoration, the food, the music, in everything his spirit was seen and felt.
“Each of the guests made us feel important and loved,” recalls the “top model,” who began working with him during Paris Haute Couture Week in 1995.
“It never goes out of style because their designs are works of art,” he concludes.
Parade of Alcurnia
Garavani’s life is not a story of obsessions, but of well-requited loves.
He loves people with good education and better titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous catwalk of sixty meters long that proposes a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and must parade down the catwalk to contemplate a dreamy "audience" who wore masterpieces of Valentino, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for his wedding to Aristotle.
In this audience of mannequins shine names such as Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosary of Bulgaria or Sophia of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the couturier, in 2006
Many of those customers say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "impossible to forget".
I remember it perfectly.
It was a pants, a shirt, a vest "gillette" and a jacket from the autumn-winter collection 1971-1972.
“It was a gift he gave me,” says Naty Abascal, one of the designer’s muses.
“I prefer him to others because of his femininity, because of his great love for women, because he enhances our beauty,” the former Duchess of Feria adds.
I really like the colors it uses, they have great light and are "donors" to the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and fashion writer Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget the first time she wore a Valentino.
When I was a teenager and lived in Italy, I dreamed of having the age and the opportunity to wear one of his nightdresses...
The time finally came in the late 90s.
I bought my first Valentino dress to wear at a party at the castle of my cousin, Prince <0xC3><0x89>douard de Ligne.
It was a red suit, with a ruffled skirt, draped corsage and word of honor neckline.
“It was a dream come true,” says Rodrigo d’Arenberg’s widow.
“Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his obsession is the timeless,” explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her couturier's party dresses with "the utmost care ... because a dress is not only a dress, it is also the set of memories that it carries".
The "King" of Fashion
The grand finale of the Somerset House exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller’s wedding dress at her wedding to Paul from Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (as the couturier calls his seamstresses) to make this ivory silk suit with inlaid pearls, twelve different types of lace and a tail of four and a half meters.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority of the specialized press, that dress represents a milestone of the haute couture of the late twentieth century, "the return of the clients of high society".
Obsessed for years with the "savoir-<0xC3><0xAA>tre" of the elite, Valentino is now his best specimen.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest rank distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any of the spouses of his clients.
“I’ve always been struck by its refinement, its calm, its neat and perfect appearance,” D’Arenberg acknowledges.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d'Orsay.
He was at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a great friend of mine.
“He was impeccable, time doesn’t pass for him.”
If a princess says so...
The Toughest Job in the World: Kawah Ijen's Human Mules
For four euros, the porters of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and health by carrying 70 kilos of sulfur through steep stone paths
There are people for whom their work is hell and others who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who make a living extracting sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, it has to descend every day to the bottom of its crater, where the sulfurous gas emanating from the bowels of the Earth solidifies when it comes into contact with the air.
After tearing off large sulfur rocks, which in total weigh about 70 kilos, he carries them in two baskets of bamboo that he carries on his shoulders through steep stone paths.
It is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 meters above sea level, but the exhausted porters take more than 40 minutes to ascend at turtle pace, keeping the balance and carefully measuring their steps so as not to slip and fall down the precipice.
They know that any misstep could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who fell off the cliffs of Kawah Ijen years ago.
Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 euro cents for every kilogram of sulphur they extract
Once up, they make their way among the tourists who photograph them as if they were circus monkeys and, tiringly carrying the heavy baskets, they walk three kilometers to the scale that a mining company has placed a little lower, at 1,850 meters high.
It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been exploiting the volcano since 1960 and, never better said, its workers, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents) for each kilo of sulfur.
It is then sold for 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) to the petrochemical industry, as this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to bleach sugar.
“As it is normal to carry 70 kilos, we take out about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) on each trip,” explains Anto, who usually makes three deliveries daily.
It takes three hours in each and ends up ground, but they allow you to gather 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems a misery for such inhuman effort, it is triple what you would gain on the field.
“The miners’ wage is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid at 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day and the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros),” clarifies the porter, who previously worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the stake was not so hard, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a reason that, in Indonesia, is as forceful as sulfur: "I married a young woman from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought her to Java to convert."
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly, and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases
At 27 years old, Anto has been playing the skin in the Kawah Ijen, whose sulfur has already begun to take its toll despite covering his face with a mask and special glasses.
He has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases released by the volcano.
It’s the price you have to pay to get your dream.
“I will work two more years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French,” he promises in more than acceptable English.
Punished for life, this friendly and intelligent young man could be a tour guide, waiter or hotel receptionist, but instead he does the work of a mule.
Sharing a filthy wooden cabin with other porters, he gets up every day at two in the morning because the sulfur does not stop flowing at night, when its characteristic yellow color turns blue and shines in the middle of the darkness.
Defying the shadows, Anto descends into the crater lighting himself up with a small flashlight attached to his helmet, which he himself has bought with his money.
About 400 porters carry the sulfur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater.
Despite its benefits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of sulfur to save costs or provides any equipment to the porters, who work on their own and at so much the weight.
In fact, they do not even see part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) of surcharge per camera that, along with the entrance of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), the guards of this natural park charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
“This job is for the beasts and not for the people,” said Madrusin, a 42-year-old porter who has been at Kawah Ijen for three decades since leaving school.
Able to lift up to 110 kilos, he says he will endure working "as much as he can" because he needs the money to educate his three children, between 18 and 10 years old.
I won't retire, I'll die here because the volcano has been my whole life
Although the sulfur burns the throat and darkens the eyes when the wind suddenly changes and traps the miners in the thick columns that come out of the volcano, they are so hard that no one complains of suffering from serious diseases ... beyond, of course, their usual breathing problems, osteoarthritis, knee pains and shoulder sores, which have been malformed by the weight of the baskets.
Swinging the basket on his back, Unainik can now only carry 50 kilos at the age of 53.
Each day, he and his companions blast 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three trucks move to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometers away on a goat path through the undergrowth.
“I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life,” Unainik proclaims, opening his mouth wide, where he is missing several teeth.
Of his five children, the eldest, aged 30, also works carrying sulfur.
Time passes, but misery perpetuates from generation to generation one of the hardest trades in the world: that of the human mules of Kawah Ijen.
Singapore looking for babies to save economy
Singaporeans blame career, stress and the cost of property and education for not having children.
“The population of Singapore needs to grow.”
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife, let us fulfill our civic duty and believe life!
It may seem implausible that these verses are part of a peppermint pill ad, but despite that — or perhaps because of it — the video went viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The phrases are part of a rap that uses local references such as "Let's put a bao (bun) in the oven" to laugh at Singapore's birth rate.
The advertising company that made the video, BBH, is hoping that with the announcement they will be able to draw attention to the problem in a fun way.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to get people to do “their national duty.”
This is purely an internet thing, so we had to make it fun and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world at reproducing ourselves, so we felt this was a topic we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as launching perfumes with pheromones or organizing speed-dating evenings.
Many of those ideas may have been creative, but they didn’t necessarily work.
So we thought, why don’t we do as creatively as possible to solve this problem, which is to compose a rap?
1.2 children
The one who doesn’t take it so lightly is the Singapore government.
It spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for marriages and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a wealthy, high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
Singapore's birth rate, according to its national population division, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2 – known as the replenishment rate – was in 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans have any more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of marriage and family policy at the National Population Division, says it’s because of a “better education” and “a wider range of career opportunities.”
“That has allowed people to have a wider range of choices in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond getting married and starting a family,” she explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to increased singleness, and delayed marriage and births, resulting in a decline in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at dramatically increasing immigration to cope with the declining population has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where barely disguised xenophobia abounds against many new immigrants, particularly the Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and not integrating.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year Singapore’s ruling party experienced its worst election result since independence.
Since the elections there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with higher quotas and levies for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the fall in the birth rate has known effects on a nation’s economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore’s example is also having some unexpected consequences.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, it has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development authority has moved to control the number of small apartments, known as shoeboxes, that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and have been very successful in sales.
However, there are concerns that they may promote a singles lifestyle and discourage developers who want to build large, family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of real estate firm EL Developers, says his “shoe boxes” sell much faster than larger units.
They are more popular, in the sense that units run out days, even weeks, faster than larger units.
This makes it much better for our cash flow.
However, he admits that the new rules give clearer guidance to developers, who were previously hampered if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
While these new rules may be a step toward raising the national birth rate, talking to Singaporeans working in the downtown financial district looks like they’re not going to have much of an effect.
“People are very stressed, houses are expensive and so is education, so a lot of people are putting it off,” says one young executive.
Other people may have children.
“But for me it’s important to have my own money and time,” says another young man in his 20s.
Men and women cite their careers, stress, and the cost of property and education as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, no matter how much the government tries to push its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, Singaporeans have the last word.
Private Offline is Private On Line
Privacy.
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy it is about the quality of private or "the sphere of private life that one has the right to protect from any intrusion".
What is private for a child under 16?
How do you apply this definition in your daily life and on social media?
Do you understand the dangers to which you are exposed by airing situations on the Internet that you would surely not share offline?
The newspaper interviewed five boys between the ages of 10 and 15 who were frequent users of the network.
In four of the cases, they associated the term with “something very mine,” on a personal level, and “in the user’s key and name,” when they applied it to social networks.
“My deepest secrets wouldn’t be uploaded to a post,” says Jorge, 10, as he tries to explain the meaning of private on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
“They are very secret secrets, my mom can know them, but not everyone,” she says.
In FB I upload beautiful images or games.
I also have fun with my acquaintances.
“I wouldn’t share a picture that’s not mine, or someone who’s making a fool of themselves,” he says.
The child recognizes that it is wrong to post obscene photographs, of naked people, of crimes or write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge claims to know the 35 friends he has on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
The mother is included, she has the key to one of the accounts.
I opened Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just upload them," he adds.
“Social media is entertaining, I can talk to distant relatives or my friends quickly,” he says.
He does not hesitate to answer that he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
I wouldn't listen to anyone recommending you to a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old Jose is different.
The teenager has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in the latter admits not knowing 20 of the people added to his list of friends.
“It doesn’t scare me, because we have something in common, music for example,” he says.
According to the boy, no one has hinted at him or asked for his home address or phone number.
“If they pressured me or demanded it, I just take them out of my account,” he said.
José became a follower of Ask, after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is no stranger to the experiences of what is now known as cyberbullying.
An acquaintance of a friend of mine was being extorted on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
“I never knew who he was,” he says.
The victim, according to Jose, did not close the account.
“It just gave him privacy.”
It then explains a series of steps to set up the account securely.
Unlike Jorge, this guy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would, if I don't like it or if I feel like it.
“Even though I know that’s cyberbullying,” he says.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, English teacher and graduate in Education and Learning, believes that to guide children and adolescents must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
“The Internet emerged as a means of searching for information, but with the emergence of these sites the rules of the game changed,” he says.
Porras points out that academician Marc Prensky, master’s degree in Pedagogy from Yale University and author of the work Natives and Digital Immigrants, coined these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are them, the children and young people who were born with the technology.
“We’re the digital immigrants that we have to teach them, when we’re still learning,” he says.
He comments that the issue is complex, "because we are asking them to have a defined criterion on what it is appropriate or not to disseminate, publish or say at an age that maturity does not give for that."
“Also be selective when what matters most to them is being popular, having thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences.”
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach children and adolescents what privacy is is through questions that make them reflect.
“Telling them not to do it doesn’t help,” he adds.
There are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, would you like them to post a picture of you like the one you posted about a friend?
Do you know what others post about you?
When you tag party photos, did you ask other people’s permission to tag them?
And one more thing, does everyone need to know what you’re doing every moment?
Another point is to make them see that they must act online as they do offline.
It's the same rules.
“One off the internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, the same should be true on social media,” he says.
Vigilance
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teacher and educational consultant, comments that it is essential that parents read the policies of social networks.
By understanding each of the sections, they have a solid foundation to talk to their children about the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
“For example, age and what is allowed to be shared or posted,” he says.
According to Guardia, it’s key to remind children of the “don’t talk to strangers” lesson.
UNASUR Summit ends without making the Lima Declaration public
The VI Presidential Summit of the South American Union of Nations (UNASUR) concluded today in Peru without making public the Lima Declaration, previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven attending presidents.
Efe repeatedly tried to access the document signed at the VI Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of UNASUR, but sources from the Foreign Ministry and the Presidency indicated at the beginning that they were going to deliver it after the closure, but later stated that at some point it will be published on the website of the Peruvian Government.
When consulted by the text, they pointed out that the content had been exposed by the president of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during brief statements to the press.
Journalists’ access to Summit information was restricted at all times.
During the day, only the video without sound of the presidential assembly with the message "private session, restricted audio" was broadcast in the press room.
The little information that circulated among the reporters was delivered by the press spokespersons of some of the governments of the UNASUR attending the meeting, although not the Peruvian.
The only document released during the day was the list of attending presidents, which caused the discomfort of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media asking for more data.
Subsequently, the Presidency of Peru sent an email to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it is about Humala's pronouncement, and not the official document that closed the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third South American-Arab Summit (ASPA), and on that occasion, despite being insistently requested by the press, the so-called Lima Declaration that they had previously announced was not disseminated either.
On the official website of ASPA it can be corroborated that the document was published last Tuesday.
In both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities made every effort to ensure that transmission systems were in place for all journalists, but limited the collection of information as much as possible.
The summit also concluded with a joint commitment by Chile and Peru to accept a ruling by the Hague Court that settles a border dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era, met during the regional meeting and ratified that they will respect the decision of the (ICJ), which begins Monday in The Hague to hear the arguments of both parties, in the process that Lima presented against Santiago.
“We will abide by and execute the sentence that defines the differences that we are bringing to this international court today,” said Humala, together with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has been, is and will continue to be a country respectful of international law, the peaceful settlement of disputes, treaties and international courts," Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era added, shaking hands with Humala, next to the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation of both presidents that they will submit to the ICJ came after Colombia denounced this week the Bogotá Pact by which it had agreed to submit to the rulings of that international court, after a decision on maritime limits with Nicaragua that it considered seriously wrong.
The summit was attended by the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the dismissal of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was in charge of opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit, shortly after noon in Lima.
The president read the final document in which he reported that 16 agreements were adopted and the lines of action were set for 31 projects between the South American countries for a total of 17 billion dollars in investments.
Among the agreements adopted he mentioned that the countries of UNASUR will take "important steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship for which we are expanding the agreements on residence".
He reported that actions are being promoted to improve "cooperation in the fight against citizen insecurity and against transnational organized crime, actions to make medicines more accessible, low-cost internet access in all corners of South America, and jointly and efficiently address the risks of natural disasters."
With a Europe in crisis, “the economic consolidation (of Latin America) should not have a triumphalist matrix but should serve to expand our productive matrix and envision a better future for our peoples,” Humala added.
“We have decided to privilege a group of 31 emblematic projects that will improve the connection of the spaces of South America, especially in rural and border areas ... uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits,” the Peruvian president said in a message read.
Among those projects, he mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and are located in the transversal axes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two point to a greater connection with Ecuador, although he did not give greater details.
The final document also mentioned the political situation in Paraguay.
“We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve to rejoin the Union of South American Nations,” from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated, and good relations between neighbors, was another of the issues highlighted by the summit.
In this sense, the president of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before starting his participation in the regional meeting that he hoped to meet with his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to treat in a respectful way the maritime dispute after a ruling of the ICJ, questioned by Bogotá.
“Tomorrow (Saturday) I may have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega,” Santos said.
“We will review all these paths, they are not exclusive, even the treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua,” he stressed.
“With President Ortega, I hope to be able to tell him that we will handle this in the most civilized and respectful way possible,” Santos said.
Santos and Ortega would meet Saturday in Mexico where they plan to attend the inauguration of the new president of that country, Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto.
Also, as part of the summit, the bloc’s defense ministers previously met to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defense in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are part of UNASUR, although the last country is suspended.
Peru holds the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from Europe to integrate a citizenship": Rafael Correa
The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which "South America, in this case yes, must learn from Europe."
Correa, who participated in the VI Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), held in Lima, told state TV Peru that Europeans "killed themselves in World War II" and in other conflicts, "but now they are practically a homeland."
He defended, in that sense, the project to establish South American citizenship encouraged by UNASUR member countries.
"We must achieve the free mobility of citizens and workers for any South American country, as is already the case with the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to return us to the past," he warned.
The Ecuadorian president was also in favor of the recomposition of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premise of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who have signed the San José pact on human rights.
Those who give professorships never commit to anything and, instead, we South Americans sign everything.
“It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under U.S. funding,” he said, referring to Ecuador’s political asylum granted to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa said he is not sorry for that decision because it has not betrayed his principles, but has respected his "deep democratic values and human rights."
He added that, at the time, “there were well-founded suspicions that Assange was extradited to a third country and his process was not respected.”
He also criticized the Swedish justice system for requiring him to be questioned on its territory for an alleged sexual crime when “Swedish legislation itself allows it to be done by videoconference, which could be done from the Ecuadorian embassy in London.”
Correa said there was a risk that Assange’s physical and mental health would deteriorate.
“I haven’t spoken to him since he’s been in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, nothing serious,” he said.
What there is is the danger that your physical and mental health will deteriorate because you are locked in a small space without being able to exercise outdoors.
“That complicates anyone’s health,” he added.
Correa noted that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, by granting a safe-conduct that allows him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities and stressed that there have been talks with London in search of a solution to the imprisonment of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate with human rights, that word we do not use in this case, but there have been permanent conversations.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garz<0xC3><0xB3>n, is doing a series of proceedings in different European instances," he said.
"If Britain gives the safe-conduct tomorrow, it will be over."
And if Sweden, as its legislation perfectly allows and as it has done in other cases, interrogates Mr. Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or interrogates him via Skype, this problem will end tomorrow.
Correa took the opportunity to reaffirm himself as a defender of freedom of the press and said that what he does not tolerate is "mediocrity, bad faith and lies, which distort freedom of expression."
“The greatest enemies of press freedom are not the evil and perverse politicians but the bad journalists on the basis of profit, blackmail and extortion,” he said.
In this regard, he welcomed the fact that it is no longer these journalists "neither the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador", and he said that if re-elected, "it will deepen the revolution to continue the path and the right direction".
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto on Paraguay in the UNASUR at least until its next elections, arguing that the body "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and coup d'état dressed in legality" because in reality "it destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy."
The Ecuadorian president also considered "perfectly pertinent" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to now negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries after the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which benefited Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty.
At the moment, we do not accept this ruling.
It is a problem between a South American country and a Central American one.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
We have to process them broadly to overcome them and move forward.
He also trusted in a good conclusion of the litigation for maritime limits that Peru and Chile maintain in the same court and opined that "it is right for Latin America to seek international instances if the two countries undertake to accept a judgment as harsh as it may be."
Referring to the eventuality that he presents himself as a candidate in the next presidential elections in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive term, he said that he sees that possibility "with a lot of optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite hard."
Correa said that if he loses the February 2013 elections, he will withdraw from public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unjust as that of Ecuador, that socioeconomic poverty can only be corrected from political power.
“My political movement believed that I was the one who guaranteed that probable victory, because we have to accept that responsibility,” he said.
If I win, it would be my last term in the presidency, and that’s where we come out of public life.
If we lose in the same way.
“It’s a decision,” he said.
Correa also referred to the new health treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro and he tells me that he traveled to a treatment that was already planned, routine, that was expected to pass the campaign to return to Cuba.
"It does not mean a relapse in the state of health of President Chavez," he said.
The Ecuadorian head of state participated today in Lima in the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress, equality and security.
AIDS deaths today are cause for late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed to have the test result: AIDS positive.
“It was as if I dropped a bombshell,” he says, recalling the moment of the announcement, which the doctor tried to make “smoother,” with no obvious success.
The boy hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to learn about it; with such determination that he already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is, without a doubt, one of the oldest patients of the HIV Unit of the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), which he arrived in 1994 after several battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 1990s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
Then, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him “because he brought a cut.”
AIDS was synonymous with death.
It is now possible to survive this syndrome and do so with quality of life.
However, ignorant of their disease, many people still arrive when the virus has already wreaked havoc, "depleted" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, at least of the first reported cases, "the great achievement at this time means that the survival of a patient who starts treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population, is exactly the same," said the head of the HIV Unit of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, after saying that this information was endorsed in April this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Andrade Villanueva, an infectious disease expert and HIV/AIDS expert, commented that since 2008, scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a fatal sentence, but years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of damage to the immune system presented by patients at the beginning of the diagnosis, with better expectations for those who are not drug users: up to 30 years with a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years CD4.
In simple words, this means that those who are diagnosed with HIV positive at 25 years of age, under these terms "as long as it remains in control will be able to live without problems until the age of 75," explained the interviewee.
To measure this progress, it should be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years on average.
While mortality has dropped significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS dropped from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, with 187 deaths as of May this year; however, there has been universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why are there still deaths?
It seems to me that the problem is not access to treatment.
This is how I see it, this is how it has happened to us in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we have not had shortage of medication the problem is that patients arrive very advanced because they do not know their state of infection, that is, in late stages of the disease.
“Nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have an opportunistic infection, what has to be done to have a greater impact on global mortality is to make earlier diagnoses and, therefore, massive screening tests have to be offered to all people who require it.”
In his proposal coincide specialists and officials of the State Council for AIDS Prevention in Jalisco (Coesida), also the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who went to be tested in a particular laboratory, only motivated because he had done it a friend and, despite his young age, was already in the AIDS stage and even suffered Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they’re going to die and don’t want to know anything.
“If I’m already going to die, I better bust up three times a week,” they say no in my case.
The change was to improve, I eat well, I exercise, I take the medicines.
To date, his parents only know that he suffered from cancer.
I live a normal life, just like everyone else.
"I work, I have many activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but co-responsible, I take care of myself and the other person," said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to motivate with his testimony those who today, in the framework of World AIDS Day, are afraid.
That they get tested, if they were at risk, that the sooner they know if they are HIV positive, it is better and if they already have the diagnosis, that they learn that they can live like anyone, being responsible.
That, his message, summarizes the battle motto for AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There are big gaps between health programs and ordinary citizens, said Ricardo Salazar, a Tapatio journalist who has taken on the cause of HIV.
And the biggest is in prevention.
In the places dedicated to this task "the distribution of condoms has effectively increased, before they gave us one or two, now they give us packages of a hundred, and that is very good but it turns out that there are those who today still do not have access to a condom," he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
“Why do you love them?” is a common question, with sneering and value judgments from social workers, school counselors, pharmacy employees and health personnel, to whom teenagers do not want to be exposed, the communicator said.
He proposed reorienting this ineffective distribution; that condoms are not only behind counters and that those hundred are in public restroom dispatchers of the places that young people frequent.
It does not motivate promiscuity.
Nor is it a question of paying them the chelas and the motel, as Governor Emilio González replied, when asking him if there would be condom distribution in his Administration.
"This is not sexuality, it is best to bring condoms closer to those who already practice sexual activity," he said.
Keys in Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 of AIDS and 1,317 of HIV).
The state ranks 4th nationally in new and cumulative cases of AIDS and 13th for HIV.
92% of infections correspond to the sexual route, 6% to the blood route and 2% to the perinatal route.
It is estimated that 50,000 people may be living with HIV since for one recorded case there are 4 to 5 people who do not know it.
Ratified by a U.S. appeals court a judgment that ignores the restructuring of Grupo Vitro’s debt achieved via a commercial tender in Mexico, the scenario sets a nefarious precedent for any national company with branches in the neighboring country that has solvency problems.
It would be said, therefore, that the procedures underlying the survival of the firms allowed by Mexican laws are not valid in the country of the stars and the bars, against international conventions.
On the practical level, the endorsement of the sentence issued on June 15 by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bankruptcy Court for the northern district of Texas, leaves Mexican firms defenseless against the possibility of seizure of their properties beyond the Bravo.
However, the resolution opens the door for the main glass manufacturer in Mexico to go to the Supreme Court of the United States, alleging three inconsistencies.
At the outset, while the judge in the case points out that creditors must be governed by the Bankruptcy Act of the United States, the Court of Appeals of the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, says that the main procedure is the commercial contest processed in Mexico.
The first point would involve ignoring international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with a transnational profile.
In fact, to that end, the United Nations Model Law for Uniform International Trade Law was created, with the American Law Institute as the arbitrator.
In the second place, the judgment establishes that without the intercompany vote, recognized in the critical mass of the commercial competition the debts that the subsidiaries of Vitro had with their parent company, the majority required to approve the restructuring would not have been achieved.
However, the possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro was not the first case in which the scheme was accepted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose intercompany debts were endorsed by the Federal Institute of Mercantile Competitions.
The truth, moreover, is that by subtracting the votes of the subsidiaries, anyway the creditors of Vitro who fought against it in the United States Courts, that is to say the "vulture" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, will not have achieved a majority.
The vote would have been 45 percent to 37.
This is omitted by the Court of Appeal.
From another angle, he blames Vitro for the difficult situation he faced from 2008 on, in the face of the serious economic crisis faced by the United States, hitting the country hard.
For the time being, the signature of the González Sada family will file an appeal for reconsideration with the appeals court itself so that the vote reaches the full court, that is, the five judges, given that only three voted.
If this does not succeed, the appeal of Cerciorare will be claimed, which requires the review of the process by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States.
The seriousness of the case is that the court overlooked a document sent by the government of Mexico under the figure of amicus curiae ("friend of the Court"), which details the procedure followed by Vitro under the framework of the Law of Commercial Concourses, noting that it was released with attachment to the agreements signed by both countries to tie this with chapter 15 of the Law of Bancarros.
Moreover, it was noted that the country had complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules established for cross-border insolvency cases, which guaranteed equity for debtors and creditors.
Carambola de dos bandas: they beat Vitro and beat him in the country.
Balance sheet
Sleeping for several months the complaints placed on the table by the unions of Mexicana de Aviaci<0xC3><0xB3>n against the former owner of the company, Gast<0xC3><0xB3>n Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration, the Trade Union Association of Pilots Aviators already found the bottleneck.
The instance headed by Carlos D<0xC3><0xAD>az Chávez Morineau has just filed a criminal complaint against the National Banking and Securities Commission who is accused of obstruction of justice.

The resources would have been channeled to the purchase of shares of the Professional Hotel Administrator.
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Searching for Dragon Mart
Meeting over the weekend at a forum at the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, business leaders and members of civil society in general approved the creation of a broad front to oppose the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We are talking, as you know, about a colossal sales and distribution center facing Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from the country of the wall, with a fitting housing area for employees of 150 companies.
Previously the Canacintra had managed to unify the governors of the southeast area to oppose the monumental thing that razed part of protected areas and poses the mother of all attacks against the industry.
The Acta died.
The government overturned a Senate demand to explain under what terms and circumstances Mexico’s ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known by its acronym in English as ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property the matter has already passed to the file.
As you know, the action took place despite the fact that the Senate itself had dismissed the possibility as an attack on freedom of expression on social networks.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball has been my life"
Basketball globetrotter Hector "Hetin" Reyes was linked to the sport of the board for more than 60 years and, thanks to him, traveled the whole world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have as broad a mental collection of local basketball history as Hector "Hetin" Reyes has.
Before a stroke confined him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, whether as a minor player, a player in the National Superior Basketball, a proxy and leader in the BSN with the Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n Cowboys or president of the Basketball Federation.
“I put on many hats in basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time, such as when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the National Team and federative president during the 90s,” Reyes recalled during a Primera Hora visit to his home in Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n, where he resides with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball has been my life."
Reyes does not exaggerate when making that claim.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memorabilia that denote his extensive career, testify to this.
Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n in the heart
Of all, the ones he treasures with the greatest emotion are those that recall his time with the Cowboys from the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, when he turned 15 as a co-owner or proxy of the franchise.
“Those were my best years, the ones I enjoyed the most because I had the opportunity to be part of eight Cowboys championships since 1967, whether as a proxy, co-owner or manager.
There were many years of satisfactions, including the five championships run from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, Jerome Mincy's debut year at the BSN.
From then on, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, took over," Reyes said.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had directed here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), telling me, “I have a very strong player, 6” 7” tall.
Do you want it?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended sniper Raymond Gausse, who was nativized and was one of our top marksmen.
I remember him saying that if Mincy had given Bayamon a championship, Gausse would help bring another one.
The championship of the Cowboys with Gausse enjoyed it, but already in the distance, because by 1988 it was listed as a federative command.
For that time he preferred to enjoy his executions and those of Mincy in the National Team.
I remember when we first beat the United States during the 1989 Mexico Olympic Games.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we came fourth and it must have been bronze if it wasn’t for that Canadian referee who made us repeat the final play for the second time, Reyes said.
Is that 1990 World Cup group the best national team you've ever seen?
He is among the best, just like the one who beat Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the Pan-Americans in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and gave the U.S. team a lead, which was quite similar to the one that won us the bronze in the World Cup.
That team not only repeated Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico L<0xC3><0xB3>pez and "Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n" (Ortiz), but also had young (Javier) "To<0xC3><0xB1>ito" Col<0xC3><0xB3>n and James Carter, the Leon brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to be in the 90 due to a knee injury.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of personnel, but gave us a gold medal and a great joy was that of the 1995 Pre-Olympic in Neuquén, Argentina.
With role players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and a youth Rolando Hourruitiner replacing the players suspended for the Panamericano de Mar del Plata mess, we won gold against all odds.
Who has been the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, that was Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n Ortiz.
Their numbers at the international tournament level are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at that level as did Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n.
And that’s without counting his trajectory in the different leagues he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
That's very difficult.
We have had a very good litter that includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
I love the work of Leo Arill.
What do you consider your greatest achievement in the federation?
To have been part of the most glorious era of the National Team between 1988 and 1995 and that at the beginning of the 90s the BSN had up to 17 teams in a season.
What's left for you to do?
There were things that I would have wanted to implement, such as the regionalization of the minor categories.
For example, the Ponce boys only played in their area and only faced teams from other corners of the Island in the national playoffs.
Right now children travel and play too much unnecessarily.
At least I see the fruit of the compulsory certifications and course for leaders, table officers and referees.
That pleases me.
What are you doing now?
The most I do is listen to music, watch music videos from my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games.
And of course, enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Actor Larry Hagman has died.
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931, in Fort Worth, Texas, became world famous for his central role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R.", in the television series "Dallas," in which he played an unscrupulous, malicious and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as predatory oil tycoon J.R. Ewing on the television series “Dallas” became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
I was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas," died Friday afternoon of complications from cancer, according to a family statement provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., the producer of "Dallas."
“Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, again playing the iconic role he loved the most,” the family said.
Larry’s family and closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played his wife in the original series and sequel, was with Hagman when she died in a Dallas hospital, her publicist Jeffrey Lane said.
It brought joy to everyone I knew.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him dearly.
“He was an original person and lived life to the fullest,” Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and acknowledged that he had been drinking heavily for years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was found in his liver and he underwent a transplant.
Years before "Dallas," Hagman became famous on television as a decent guy in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie," aired on NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is altered when he meets an attractive genius, played by Barbara Eden, and takes her to live with him at his home.
He also starred in two short-lived comedies, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971–72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His film work included critically acclaimed roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful portrayal of the charmingly obnoxious J.R. that brought Hagman to stardom.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other characters in its orbit aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional phrase "Who shot J.R.?", thought to generate expectation around an episode full of emotions in which the character of Hagman is almost killed, generated international speculation and millions of dollars risky in bookmakers.
It also helped give the series a record audience at the time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 episode, an average of 41 million viewers tuned in and made "Dallas" the second most-watched entertainment program in history, behind the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. got her pregnant and then threatened to call her a prostitute unless she left town, but others also had reason to attack him.
Hagman portrayed Ewing as an insatiable corrupt with a charismatic smile: a cheating businessman and a cheating husband who tried to get his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), hospitalized.
"I know what I want on J.R.'s gravestone," Hagman said in 1988.
He should say, "Here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only deal he lost.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as someone “huge, on and off screen.”
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans in the world, and in the hearts of each one of us, who were lucky enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success for the TNT channel.
It had already finished recording five of the episodes for the second season and a sixth was in the works, the network reported.
There was no immediate word from Warner or TNT on how the series will handle Hagman’s loss.
Originally from Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred in such classics as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan."
Martin was still a teenager when she had him in 1931 during her marriage to attorney Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the stage in New York in the early 1950s, and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
While there he met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he published his memoir Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.
“I didn’t put anything in there that I thought was going to hurt someone or affect them in any way,” he told Prensa Asociata at the time.
After the liver transplant he became a promoter of organ donation and volunteered at a hospital to assist fearful patients.
"I advise them, I give them courage, I meet with them when they come for their surgeries, and then," he said in 1996.
I try to offer some comfort, like “fear not, it will be a little uncomfortable for a short time, but you’ll be fine.”
He was also an anti-smoking activist and participated in several campaigns.
Start course that explores the "End of the World"
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when religion professor Stuart Charmé decided to teach a course on the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible hook: The end of the Mayan Calendar’s “long countdown” on December 21, which many people have clung to as proof that the end of the world is coming.
But Charmé had no idea what awaited him in the next couple of months: the cataclysmic Hurricane Sandy, a fiscal cliff that some have called “deudarmagedon” and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where end-time Christian theorists believe the Apocalypse will begin.
“I didn’t realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester ever,” Charmé told students at Rutgers-Camden University this week.
If you analyze what has been happening in the world today as if we were 30 days away and counting, this has been a really good period.
And remember that evil is good for those with an apocalyptic mindset.
And he’s not the only professor offering courses on the “end of the world” this semester, theoretically the last in history.
At Temple, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker is teaching the course “Media, Culture and the End of the World”.
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
“We looked at why these ideas proliferate over time,” he said, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that guide certain human behavior.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, war could break out.
This month students analyzed films with apocalyptic themes and explored how they compare to real-life examples.
“I’ve tried to inform students about what is possible, probable, credible, and impossible,” Vacker said.
On the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, Professor of Latin American History Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an adjunct professor of Art History and Anthropology, have teamed up to teach a course, titled only “The End of the World.”
"We don't add '2012' to always have the option to teach the course again, in case the world doesn't end," Restall said.
Despite the "imminent ruin", students must study, generate projects and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the apocalypse, leaving students no choice but to work “until the very night the world is supposed to end,” Restall said.
The courses proved quite popular.
“It saturated in two hours,” Restall said of his course for high-achieving students, which was filled with 35 students.
We received emails for weeks and weeks before the start of the semester from people asking if there was still room.
The students, on the other hand, say that the course is one of the most interesting.
“I find it fascinating to see what people do to console themselves,” said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old career student in Religion and Sociology from Haddonfield, N.J., in Rutgers-Camden.
And it is that the apocalyptic mentality, secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort or the absence of it.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old psychology and nursing major student, said he had seen all the apocalyptic movies.
“I’ve never heard of a class that could teach that,” he said.
I'm enjoying it.
But no student interviewed — let alone a teacher — said they believed the Dec. 21 expiration date.
“Our first project was about Mayan prophecy and in a way we discredited it,” said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old Temple senior from West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it’s just a key point in the calendar, Restall said.
But he noted that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, dating back several centuries, in which people react to changes around them predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a boom in these speculations.
“In other places people don’t think about this,” he said.
Especially in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a religion professor at La Salle University who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he knew about any “end of the world” courses there.
“The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world,” he wrote, hinting at an exception from a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall noted that over the years there has been talk of many doomsday days, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophizing that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world will end.
Students and teachers are taking the date lightly.
Several said they plan to go to "end-of-the-world" parties.
“Maybe I’ll call some friends to laugh together,” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
