Members of the Assembly of Wales are concerned about "looking like clowns"
There is a sense of consternation among some members of the Assembly at the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal arose as a result of plans to change the name of the Assembly in the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly from across the political arena are concerned that this may sound ridiculous.
A member of the Labour Party Assembly said that his party is concerned that "it may rhyme with Twp and Pwp."
For readers who don’t live in Wales: In Welsh, twp means idiot and pwp means poop.
A member of the Plaid Assembly said the group as a whole was "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative party claimed to be "open" to the name change, but pointed out that only a small verbal step separates MWP from Muppet (clown).
In this context, the letter W in Welsh is pronounced similarly to the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter U.
The committee of the assembly, which is currently being drafted for the introduction of name changes, said: "The final decision on any descriptors of what the members of the assembly will be called will obviously be a matter of debate for the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 granted the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which showed broad support for the possibility of calling the Assembly of the Parliament of Wales.
As regards the title of Members of the Assembly, the Commission has expressed its preference in favour of Welsh Parliament Members or WMP (Members of the Welsh Parliament), but the MWP option has received greater support in a public consultation.
AMs are apparently proposing alternative options, but the difficulties in reaching consensus could prove to be a headache for President Elin Jones, who is expected to present a legislative proposal on the changes within a few weeks.
The law on reforms will include further changes to the functioning of the assembly, including regulations on the exclusion of AMs and the design of the system of committees.
The MAs will get the final vote on their name during the discussion of the legislation.
Macedonians go to the polls for referendum on name change
On Sunday, voters will decide whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia."
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to end a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which owns a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that its northern neighbour’s name represents a claim on its territories and has repeatedly opposed its membership applications to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the name change plebiscite, said he would not consider the result of the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change is simply the price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin’s are hushed while the churches of Harlem are in trouble
“The elders I spoke with say that in the past there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Adams said.
“Neither of us are here today.”
He explained that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“People socialize differently today,” he explained.
“Bars are no longer the neighborhood lounges that people regularly attend.”
As for churches, he worries that the money from the sale of the estate will not last as long as leaders expect, “and sooner or later they will go back to where they started.”
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums filled with the kind of people who won’t help the neighborhood’s remaining sanctuaries.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings are white," he says, "and for that reason they will hasten the time when these churches will close altogether because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by confraternities before Harlem became a black neighborhood – Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St Martin’s a decade later.
The initial white Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
A black congregation praying in a nearby church took possession of the building.
St. Martin’s was acquired by a black congregation headed by the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott against retailers on 125th Street, one of Harlem’s main shopping streets, who refused to hire or promote people of color.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but while Father Johnson's parishioners were planning its reconstruction, they also ordered the music box.
The Rev. David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the music box "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played the carillon in July called it differently: “A cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument.”
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also pointed out that it was the first music box in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who switched to a larger music box at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather claimed that St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has been staged in St. Martin's in recent months has been a complicated plot by architects and entrepreneurs, some presented by lay church leaders, others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parish assembly, the governing body of the parish, made up of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July about its concerns that the diocese was “trying to offload costs” on the parish assembly even though the latter was not involved in hiring architects and entrepreneurs sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners have complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old man diving for lobster fishing in California
Official sources say that on Saturday a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while diving for lobsters in California, during the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy screaming and swam up to him with a group of people to pull him out of the water.
Hammel thought at first that it was only enthusiasm due to the capture of a lobster but then "he realized that the boy was screaming 'I've been bitten!
I've been bitten!'
His entire collarbone was torn," Hammel said he noticed once he reached the boy.
"I yelled at everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" Hammel added.
The boy was transported by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was hospitalized in critical condition.
The shark species responsible for the attack is not known.
Captain Larry Giles said in a statement to the media that a shark had been sighted in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had been declared not to belong to any dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper chest area.
Authorities have barred access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami’s in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigative and security purposes.
Giles said there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans a boost to the beauty industry in the UK
Sainsbury’s is challenging Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with lanes dedicated to department store beauty products assigned to specialist assistants
As part of the UK’s <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow as sales in the fashion and home goods sectors decline, the largest lanes dedicated to beauty products will be tested in 11 stores across the country and adopted in more stores next year if successful.
The investment in beauty comes at a time when supermarkets are looking for new ways to use shelf space once dedicated to televisions, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury’s said it would double the size of its beauty supply to 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees ranges will take up more space with branded areas similar to those found in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its range of Boutique tricks so that most products are vegan - a quality increasingly demanded by younger buyers.
In addition, fragrance retailer The Fragrance Shop will test authorisations at two Sainsbury’s stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, South London while a second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and a shift toward buying small amounts of food daily from small neighborhood stores have forced supermarkets to put more effort into convincing people to buy from them.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said stores will increasingly resemble department stores as the supermarket chain tries to resist discounters such as Aldi and Lidl by offering more non-food products and services.
Sainsbury’s has introduced Argos stores in hundreds of stores and has also introduced several Habitats since it bought the two chains about two years ago, and that strategy has boosted food sales and made the acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket’s previous attempt to give enamel back to its beauty and pharmaceutical departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s but the synergy ended in a dispute over the division of revenue from pharmaceutical outlets into supermarkets.
The new strategy was adopted after Sainsbury’s sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
Lloyds was expected to play a role in the programme, with the addition in four stores of an extensive range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Chief Commercial Officer of Sainsbury’s, said: “We have transformed the look of our beauty product departments to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to offer advice.
Our range of brands has been developed to meet every need and the inviting environment and comfortable locations make us an attractive destination for beauty products, as opposed to the old fashioned way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'furious' after Holly Willoughby walked out of <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones is furious after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of an <0xC2><0xA3>11 million contract with her trending brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby no longer has time for his Truly brand of housewares and accessories.
The couple's business had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The This Morning host, 37, took to Instagram to announce her retirement.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons Den star Peter Jones furious after retiring from their lucrative last-minute trendy brand business to focus on her new exceptional contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Some sources say Jones was “furious” when the TV golden girl admitted during a tense meeting at the headquarters of her trading empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts – worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million – did not leave her enough time to devote to their Truly brand of housewares and accessories.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was calculated to double Willoughby's estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million estate.
As soon as Willoughby, 37, chose Instagram to announce his departure from Truly, Jones left Britain to head to one of his holiday residences.
According to one source: "Truly was without a doubt Holly's top priority.
It had to be her long-term future that would engage her for the next twenty years.
His decision to leave left all the people involved absolutely speechless.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, they were so close to launch.
There is a warehouse full of products at Marlow headquarters, ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the abandonment of the This Morning presenter, one of the most profitable stars in the UK, could cost the company millions due to heavy investments in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear and due to possible delays to the launch of the brand.
And it could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby conceived Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined the company as president in March.
The couples spent the holidays together and Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV’s “I’m A Celebrity.”
A source close to Jones said last night that he "doesn't want to comment on his business affairs."
Tough words and "then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the media for making a comment that some would consider “non-presidential” and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his voice in imitation of the "newscaster".
"I haven't given up anything."
He stressed that Kim is interested in a second meeting after the first in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a huge step toward denuclearizing North Korea.
But the denuclearization negotiations are at a standstill.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho addressed world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not observe an “equivalent response” from the US to North Korea’s first disarmament operations.
Instead, he stressed, the US is continuing to impose sanctions aimed at keeping the pressure high.
Trump has given a much more optimistic view of this speech.
“With North Korea, we are getting very good results,” he said.
“We were going to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results: the end of missile tests, the contribution to the release of hostages and the repatriation of the last US military personnel.
And he defended his unusual strategy by describing his relationship with Kim.
“It’s simple to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded camp, we would have about 200 people right in front of us,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate an island, causing hundreds of victims
Following the Lombok earthquake, for example, non-governmental organizations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok’s population had been displaced, the national emergency, an essential requirement for activating international aid, had not been declared.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have been very clear that they don’t want international assistance, so it’s a bit complicated,” Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is organizing a team that will travel to Palu, it is still not sure that the foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to decide whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid.
Given the earthquakes that Indonesia is continually subjected to, the country continues to be terribly unprepared in the face of the fury of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, it is not a common structure on other coasts.
The apparent lack of an alarm siren for the tsunamis in Palu, although the alarm had been given, probably contributed to the loss of life.
In the best conditions, moving between the many islands of Indonesia is complicated.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship anchored in Lombok to assist earthquake victims is heading towards Palu but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new calamity.
President Joko Widodo has put Indonesia’s improved shredded infrastructure at the centre of his election campaign and poured money into roads and railways.
But funding shortfalls have hit Joko’s administration as he prepares for re-election next year.
Joko is also facing pressure from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted the more conservative branch of the religion.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands driven from their homes due to street clashes between Christian and Muslim gangs, fighting using machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge draws against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea with an 89th minute point on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while about 25 yards from Chelsea's goal, with his team down 1-0.
He touched the left ball before pulling on the second post.
The attempt passed high above the door frame as it veered towards the upper right corner of the net.
The ball eventually fell behind Kepa Arrizabalaga, bagging into the net.
“It was just trying to get in position, get to the ball and players like Shaq are always playing as far forward as possible, so I tried to create myself as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and I gave him a touch and I didn't think too much and I pulled."
Chelsea won 1-0 in the first half after the 25th-minute goal scored by Belgium star Eden Hazard.
Blue's centre-forward went from heel to heel at Mateo Kovacic before squirting away near midfield and shooting in Liverpool's midfield.
Kovacic made a quick midfield pass.
Then he performed a beautiful pass that brought Hazard into the area.
Hazard overcame the defence and finished on the second post with a left-footed goal over Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3pm on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 15.00 on Thursday in London.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami has reached 832, the country’s disaster management agency said on Sunday morning.
Numerous people were reported trapped in the rubble of collapsed buildings following the 7.5-magnitude earthquake that struck the country on Friday and generated waves up to 6 meters high, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said during a press conference.
The city of Palu, home to more than 380,000 people, has been littered with debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of murder after woman stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds at Grayson Mews in John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have invited people who may have seen or heard something in the area to get in touch.
Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is just beginning but I would like to appeal to anyone in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious and invite them to contact us.
I would also like to appeal to anyone, particularly taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on dashcam, to contact us because they may have very important information for our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found is a resident of Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who claim to know the woman arrived at the crime scene to ask questions about the location of the find this morning.
Investigations are ongoing and police have said they are currently informing the victim’s family members.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment but was told by police that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents have been told it will take hours before they are allowed to return.
A police officer told a man that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman appeared at the scene in tears.
He keeps saying, "It's terrible."
At 2 p.m. two police vans were inside the demarcated area and another van was just outside.
Several agents were located within the demarcated area controlling the apartment building.
Anyone with information about this is invited to contact <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111 indicating register 247 of September 30.
Parliament’s Cromwell Statue Becomes Last Monument Hit by ‘History Rewriting’ Wave
His removal would be poetic justice for his Taliban destruction of so many of England’s religious and cultural objects performed by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society called Crick's proposal a "madness" and an "attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in light of the current debate over the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell’s figure outside the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
Iconoclasm during the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor conducted by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent depiction of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft by Cromwell is evidence of 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many feel should still be celebrated.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was regarded by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament from outside pressures, in his case obviously from the monarchy.
Whether this is an extremely accurate depiction is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century defined the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is an identifiable figure who represents a part of that fracture.
His achievements as Lord Protector are to be celebrated and commemorated."
Killer Pig Slams Chinese Farmer and Kills Him
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by the surname "Yuan", was found dead with a severed artery, covered in blood near a piglet at Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines to pigs at a farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He is reported to have traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a nearby piggy bank was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the piggy bank with blood on his face.
A forensic analysis confirmed that the 250-kilogram pig had licked the farmer, according to the statements.
“My cousin’s legs were covered in blood and bruised,” said the cousin identified with the surname “Wu,” as reported in the Guiyang Evening News.
Surveillance footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market official told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking other people, while police gather evidence at the crime scene.
Yuan’s family and market authorities are negotiating a refund for the farmer’s death.
Although rare, cases of attacks on humans by pigs have already been reported in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300kg pig nailed a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife managed to drive the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was devoured by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as a “catalyst.”
“They just want to play.
They are playful, very curious .... they do not want to hurt.
Just show them the right amount of respect,” he explained.
The aftermath of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy rains to the southwest of the United States.
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is losing strength as it moves over the colder waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains over northern Mexico and the U.S. southwest coast in the coming days.
Rosa recorded winds of up to 138 km/h, a Category 1 hurricane, at 5 ET on Sunday and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a blizzard is forming over the Pacific Ocean and moving eastward toward the U.S. west coast. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm, it will begin to push strong tropical moisture northward into the southwestern part of the U.S.
Rosa will bring up to 25 cm of rain in some areas of Mexico during the day on Monday.
Thus, tropical moisture in contact with the approaching scab will create heavy and extensive rainfall in the southwestern area in the coming days.
Locally, 2 to 10 cm of rain can cause dangerous flash floods, debris flows and possible landslides in the desert.
Tropical humidity will cause precipitation rates that will reach 2.5-7.5 cm per hour at some points, particularly in areas of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall of 2.5–10 cm is expected in some areas of the Southwest, particularly over much of Arizona.
Sudden flooding may occur with rapidly worsening conditions due to the widespread nature of tropical rains.
It is strongly discouraged to venture into the desert on foot in the presence of the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains could flood river canyons, and thunderstorms will bring gusty winds and raise dust.
The approaching storm surge will cause heavy rains locally on part of the southern California coast.
Rainfall of more than 1 cm will be possible, which could cause limited flows of debris and slippery roads.
This would be the region’s first rainfall in the wet season.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona in late Sunday and early Monday, before the rains become more extensive in late Monday and early Tuesday.
Heavy rains will descend on the Four Corners on Tuesday to last until Wednesday.
In October there will be strong fluctuations in temperatures over the US as the Arctic cools, but the tropics will remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to significant temperature variations over short distances.
An outstanding example of sensitive temperature differences in the central US will be recorded on Sunday.
There will be a nearly 20-degree difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, the residual heat of the summer will try to increase and expand again.
A warm beginning of October is expected for much of the central and eastern U.S., with 26°C from the Southern Plains to the northeastern areas.
In New York you can reach 26 degrees on Tuesday, or a temperature of about 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecasts indicate strong odds of above-average temperatures for the eastern U.S. through the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people followed Thursday on six television networks the compelling testimony by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault that would have occurred in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continues, with broadcasters interrupting regular programming for a last-minute turnaround Friday: a deal devised by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford has informed the Senate Judiciary Committee that she is 100 percent certain that Kavanaugh groped her while intoxicated and tried to strip her during a high school party.
Kavanaugh, during an infamous deposition, claimed to be 100% certain that this did not happen.
It is likely that more than the 20.4 million people listed by Nielsen on Friday followed the deposition.
The company was calculating the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for the other networks that broadcast it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has a hard time counting viewers who watch programs in offices.
To put it all in perspective, this is an audience similar to that for a football playoff game or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose pundits strongly supported Kavanaugh’s nomination, led all networks, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the full-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was the second largest network with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday’s drama.
After the moderate Republican office released a statement saying it would vote for Kavanaugh, Flake was picked up by CNN and CBS operatives Friday morning while being insulted by demonstrators as he tried to take an elevator to a Justice Commission hearing.
He kept his eyes down for several minutes as he was scolded and broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm right here in front of you," one woman said.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told, "You have the power while so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had released the statement and stated, before the elevator closed, that he would have other things to say during the committee hearing.
All cable networks and broadcasters streamed live a few hours later, when the Justice Commission voted to present Kavanaugh’s nomination to the entire Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would do so only with the certainty that the FBI would analyze the allegations against the candidate over the next week, as requested by minority Democrats.
Flake was partially convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Following a conversation with Coons and other senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was important, because it was clear that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of ‘doing politics’ on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans of letting the European Union “face politics” with Britain’s future and jeopardise the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, September 29, 2018.
In another interview alongside that with the prime minister on the front page of the newspaper, his former foreign minister Boris Johnson launched his attack on his so-called Chequers deal for Brexit, saying a proposal that Britain and the EU must collect their respective duties is “absolutely ridiculous”
Wayde Sims Murder: Police Arrest Suspect in LSU Player Dyteon Simpson's Death
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and taken to jail on second-degree murder charges, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Authorities have released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police say Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the crime scene and claimed to have detected Simpson’s DNA on them, reports CBS-affiliated WAFB television station.
After questioning Simpson, police said the suspect admitted to accidentally shooting Wayde.
The bail was set at $350,000, the defense attorney said.
The East Baton Rouge coroner’s office issued a preliminary report Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
The department recognized the merit of the task force for fugitives from the Louisiana State Police, the Police Science Lab, Southern University Police, and citizens of the area who assisted in the investigation that led to the arrest.
The LSU athletic director thanked the area law enforcement for their commitment and pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The 198-centimeter striker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
Last season the player averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU coach Will Wade said the team is "shocked" and "in shock" at Wayde's death.
“That’s what you worry about at all times,” Wade said.
Volcano sprinkles ash Mexico City
The ash that comes out of the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano, after activity had increased in the crater and there had been 183 emissions of gas and ash in 24 hours.
The center was checking for different rumbles and jolts.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash lining the windshields of cars in Mexico City neighborhoods such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have detected an increase in activity at the volcano that lies 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with police riot squads and thousands joined demonstrations by opponents to mark the first anniversary of the controversial Catalan vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists hampered by riot police targeted police with eggs and threw powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets that usually overflow with tourists.
There were further clashes during the day with policemen who resorted to batons to contain the fight.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanting "We will not forget, we will not forgive" clashed with unionist demonstrators shouting "Long live Spain."
The local press reported that 14 people had to receive treatment for minor injuries received during the demonstrations.
Tensions remain high in the separatist region a year after the October 1 referendum was deemed illegal by the Madrid government but recognised by Catalan separatists.
Voters had voted with an overwhelming majority for independence, although turnout had been low, and Catalans opposed to secession had largely boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the referendum that was taking place at polling stations across the region with violent clashes.
The pro-independence groups camped out on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place but had to follow an alternative route.
Narcis Termes, 68, is an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife and said he no longer had any hope of Catalonia becoming independent.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry with joy for the chance to vote, but now everything is blocked," she explained.
Despite achieving a key though measured victory in last December’s regional elections, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year, with many of the movement’s best-known leaders finding themselves in voluntary exile or jail awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and in the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest on his phone in support of police, said the conflict was fueled by politicians from both sides.
"The situation is increasingly tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in jail awaiting trial since the end of last year, announced that he will run for the European Parliament elections next year.
“To stand as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to denounce the involution of democratic values and the repression by the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: men arrested after ramming a house with a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car repeatedly slammed into a Londonderry home.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at approximately 19:30 BST.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said the damage was done to the gates and the building itself.
It is also possible that the car was hit with a crossbow at some point.
Menga's attack marks Livingston's 1-0 win against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal with Livingston scored the win
The already promoted Livingston stunned the Rangers by relegating Steven Gerrard to his second loss in 18 games as Ibrox club manager.
Dolly Menga's goal made all the difference as Gary Holt's team moved on to the second division with Hibernian.
Gerrard’s side are left without a win away from home in the Premiership this season and will face the top seed Hearts next Sunday, separating them by 8 points.
On Thursday, the Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League.
Meanwhile, Livingston continue their winning streak in the division by staying unbeaten for six games, with coach Holt still having to see a loss since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
The Livingston squanders opportunities against incisive guests
Holt's team should have been in the lead well before the goal, with their immediacy causing the Rangers a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson broke through but dragged his action in front of the mirror of the door and Alan Lithgow could only kick out of the door after inserting himself to meet Craig Halkett's header from the other side of the door.
The guests were content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could put visitors in trouble with placed kicks.
And that’s how the crucial goal was achieved.
The Rangers conceded a free kick and Livingston found an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson managed to pass to Menga, who could score from the center of the area.
Up until that point, the Rangers had dominated in ball possession but the host team's defense had proved impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had not had to worry too much.
This pattern was maintained during the second half, although Alfredo Morelos engaged Kelly in a parade.
Scott Pittman saw his goal attempt stopped from the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow made a throw out of another Livingston play scheme.
The crosses happened in the Livingston area and were continuously neutralized, while two penalty requests, after Halkett's confrontation with substitute Glenn Middleton and one for hand foul, were rejected.
A "phenomenal" performance from Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
Until the last player, they were outstanding, continuing to exceed expectations along this exceptional trajectory.
Their style of play and staff have changed very little since their return to the top flight, but you have to give a lot of credit to Holt for the way he has been able to spur the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was immense, leading a masterfully organized defense, while Menga put Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in trouble throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, were uninspired.
Despite the excellent performance at some points with Gerrard, in this case they fell well below those standards.
The last pass was missed - only once they managed to penetrate the opponent's area - and it can be considered an alarm bell for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the standings.
Erdogan received with mixed reactions in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies on Saturday (September 29th) during the breakfast meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, aimed at straining relations between NATO allies.
They clashed over issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s access to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne for the inauguration of a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest group of Turkish population outside of Turkey.
The police motivated the intervention with security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters showed up nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, including many Kurds, have made their voices heard, condemning Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The protests mirror the dissent provoked by a visitor considered a hero by some Turks in Germany and called a despot by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in collision with a car
A cyclist died in a collision with a car in London.
The incident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city, at about 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and an ambulance arrived at the scene, but the man died instantly.
The accident came months after another cyclist died, struck by a road pirate on Childers Street, about a mile from where the accident happened on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said authorities are working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Roads were blocked and buses diverted and motorists were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Guards Injured During a Riot
Six prison guards were injured during a disturbance at the maximum-security men's prison, the prison office said.
The riot broke out at the Long Lartin maximum security men’s prison in Worcestershire at around 09:30 BST on Sunday and is still ongoing.
Specialized agents "Tornado" were employed to manage the riot, which involves eight inmates and which is confined to a wing of the prison.
Officers were treated at the scene for minor injuries to the face.
A spokesman for the prison service said: “Specially trained prison personnel have been deployed to contain an incident currently underway at Long Lartin Prison.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate the presence of violence in our prisons and all those responsible will be reported to the police and could be sentenced to a longer sentence in prison.”
Long Lartin Prison is home to over 500 inmates, including some of the country’s most dangerous offenders.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had to receive hospital treatment following an attack on a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot police were called to intervene in the prison to quell a violent riot in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flash floods (which could benefit drought-stricken areas)
It’s rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that’s exactly what’s likely to happen early next week when the last energies of Hurricane Rosa cross the desert’s southwest, creating risks of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona all the way to southern and eastern Nevada, southwestern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching Monday evening with rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service said in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or tropical depression status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict rainfall between 5 and 10 cm, with isolated peaks of up to 15 cm in the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas of the southwest area, including the Central Rockies and the Great Basin will receive 2.5 to 5 cm of precipitation, with isolated peaks of up to 10 cm.
For areas foreign to the risk of flash flooding, the rain brought by Rosa could be a blessing as the region is hit by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of this precipitation is likely to be positive as the southwestern area is currently experiencing a period of drought.
According to the Drought Monitoring Center, just over 40 percent of Arizona is going through a period of extreme drought, the second highest category,” reported weather.com.
Initially the path of Hurricane Rosa will be able to land across Mexico's Baja California Peninsula.
Rosa, which still maintained hurricane strength on Sunday morning with winds at a maximum speed of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and is moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm will hit the coldest waters in the Pacific, losing power.
Then it is expected to arrive in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or on Monday evening.
Rainfall over parts of Mexico could be intense, creating a high risk of flooding.
"We expect precipitation between 7.5 cm and 15 cm from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with a maximum of 25 cm," reported weather.com.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning with tropical depression status, to then head through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
"The primary risk that may be caused by Rosa or its aftermath is heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern U.S. desert," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
Such rains are expected to generate potentially lethal flash floods and flows of debris into deserts, as well as landslides on mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three teenage boys to a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at approximately 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was transferred to hospital, where he remains in "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
The authorities have appealed to anyone who could have taken the phone what happened.
Trump says Kavanaugh 'suffered from the malice and anger' of Democratic Party
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party’s ruthless and outrageous tactics,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had “suffered from the malice and anger” of the Democratic Party during the entire nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, passionately and decisively denying Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations of sexual assault against her decades ago, when they were still teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing defending himself from the charge.
The president said Saturday that "the American people have been able to observe the extraordinary quality and courage" of Kavanaugh on that day.
“A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most experienced legal minds of our time, a jurist with an untold background in public service,” he said in front of a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The President made indirect reference to Kavanaugh's appointment by speaking of the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
“Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I’m not a candidate, but I really do work,” he said.
"For this I am strenuously striving for exceptional candidates."
Trump has stated that Democrats are committed to “resisting and hindering.”
The first fundamental procedural vote in the Senate for Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior assistant to the GOP leadership told CNN.
Hundreds killed by Indonesia earthquake and tsunami, and death toll continues to rise
At least 384 people were killed, many swept away by giant waves that slammed into beaches, when a large earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves up to 6 meters (18 feet) high slammed into the beach at dusk, wiping out scores of people, killing them and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami followed a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still busy with their activities on the beach and did not run away immediately, thus turning into victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s disaster control agency BNPB, said in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, it dragged with it cars, logs, houses, hit anything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami moved offshore at a speed of 800 km/h (497 mph) before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency showed numerous buildings and shops destroyed, twisted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to rock the coastal town on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday’s powerful earthquake was nearly 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which lies at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have boosted the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extended" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, and he added that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be greater along the 300km (190 miles) coastline north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, closer to the earthquake's epicenter.
The communications "were totally paralyzed, with no information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are over 300,000 people living in the area," the Red Cross said, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the areas involved.
“This is already a tragedy, but it could become even more serious,” he said.
The agency was widely criticised on Saturday for failing to report that a tsunami had hit Palu, although authorities said the waves had arrived by the time the alarm had been sounded.
In an amateur video shared on social media, you hear a man in an upper floor of a building screaming agitatedly to warn people of the incoming tsunami in the street below.
A few minutes later a wall of water came crashing down on the beach, sweeping away buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately authenticate the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a massive blackout that disrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
According to authorities, the army has begun sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, but the displaced still need food and other basic goods.
The city’s airport has been reopened for rescue purposes only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has scheduled a visit to the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to more than 800.
It's terrible.
Although World Vision staff in Donggala managed to reach the town of Palu safely, where employees took refuge under tarpaulin shelters in the courtyard of their office, along the way they encountered scenes of devastation, Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
It's terrible.
Even as rescue groups began the difficult start-up operations of the rescue gears, there were some complaints that foreign rescue workers with extensive knowledge were prevented from travelling to Palu.
Indonesian regulations stipulate that funding, supplies and staff from abroad can only start arriving if the site of a disaster has been declared a national disaster area.
And this has not yet happened.
"This is still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says, ‘OK, this is a national disaster,’ we can accept international assistance, but the status has not yet been defined.”
On the second night in Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of the missing still held out hope that their loved ones would be part of the miracles that alleviate the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a child was pulled out of a drain.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been stuck under the rubble for two days with her mother’s body by her side.
Gendon Subandono, the head coach of Indonesia’s national paragliding team, had been training for the Asian Games that ended this month in Indonesia for two of the missing paragliders.
Others among the people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi, were his students.
“As a veteran in the paragliding industry, I’m carrying my emotional load,” he said.
Gendon recounted how, in the hours following the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel within the paragliding community, he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to Palu’s competitors, who were attending the beach festival.
His messages, however, stopped at a single gray check mark instead of two blue signs.
“I think that means the messages haven’t been delivered,” he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 during ATM supply in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink operator who was supplying an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport Police Department press release.
The driver of the vehicle was emptying an ATM in the entertainment center and preparing to hand over more money, investigator Dennis McCarthy said in the statement.
While he was busy, another man “showed up behind Brink’s employee” and stole a bag with the money destined for delivery.
Witnesses identified several suspects fleeing the crime scene, according to the statement, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information regarding the identities of the offenders is encouraged to contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
In announcing the name change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The person formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has long been nicknamed Ye and used the nickname as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change came ahead of her appearance on Saturday Night Live, where she will present her new album, Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her participation for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously stated that the word contains a religious meaning to him.
"I think 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and it means 'you'," West said earlier this year, speaking about the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
"So it's you, it's us, it's about us.
We have gone from Kanye, which means the only one, to simply Ye – the reflection of our goodness, our meanness, our confusion, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are."
He is just one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, JAY-Z, also changed the name with or without hyphen and capital letters.
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed not to use the military against the civilian population.
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against the civilian population, marking the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
Lopez Obrador vowed Saturday in Tlatelolco Square to "never use the army to repress the Mexican people."
Soldiers had fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were gaining a foothold throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly student grants and opening more public universities.
He said unemployment and a lack of educational opportunities are pushing young people towards criminal gangs.
The U.S. Should Double Funding for AI
As China becomes increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the funds dedicated to research in this field, says AI investor and operator Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow announcements by several U.S. government groups about AI, although the U.S. lacks a formal AI strategy in general.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its program last year: it aims to be the No. 1 country in AI innovation by 2030.
“Double the budget in AI research would be a good start considering that all other countries are much further behind the U.S. and we need a new revolution in AI,” Lee said.
The doubling of funding could double the chances of the next big success in the AI industry being achieved in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s leading AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the American Otello player with the highest score and subsequently served as an executive at Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese section of Google.
Lee recalled previous U.S. government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge and asked when the next one would be held, in order to identify new visionaries.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get funding from the government, Lee said.
“It’s not China that’s taking away the leaders in academia, it’s the multinationals,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired luminaries from universities to work on AI projects.
Lee said changes to immigration policy could help the U.S. boost its AI efforts.
“I think green cards should be offered automatically to AI PhD students,” he explained.
The Chinese State Council published its program for the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Sciences Foundation provides funding to those working in academic institutions, similar to how the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute funds to U.S. researchers, poor quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee explained.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, aimed at engaging industrial partners and universities, and the White House announced the formation of a Special Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. law aimed at creating a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has not registered activity for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change the country's name
The people of Macedonia voted Sunday in a referendum on whether to change the country’s name to “Republic of North Macedonia,” a move that would resolve the decades-long dispute with Greece that has blocked its membership bids to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which owns a province called Macedonia, claims that the names of its neighbors constitute a claim on its territory and has vetoed Macedonia's entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments struck a deal in June under the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents believe the change would damage the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic-majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and the boycott campaign has raised doubts about whether turnout will reach the minimum of 50% needed for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum card is as follows: "It agrees with NATO and EU membership and with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is the price to pay for Macedonia to be admitted to institutions such as the EU and NATO, one of the countries emerging from the collapse of the former Yugoslavia.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the aegis of the European Union because that means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of members of parliament have stated that they will respect the result of the vote to make it final.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state electoral commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters had cast their vote.
“I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko voted in a referendum in Macedonia to change the name of the country that would open the door to NATO and European Union membership in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the Wall in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage and arranging the chairs in front of the tents set up by those who want to boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter with our heads held high, not for the back door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China or Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
“I think the overwhelming majority will be in favor because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favor of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after voting.
He declared that a “yes” would be the “confirmation of our future.”
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Analysis reported that between 30 and 43% of voters would have participated in the referendum – a percentage below the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by Macedonia’s Telma TV, indicated that 57% of respondents planned to go to vote on Sunday.
Of this 57%, 70% said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be valid, turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
A failed referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since it took office in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero scores a goal avoiding Brighton's entire defence
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling handled Brighton's defence during Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his 65th-minute point look extremely easy.
The Argentine striker received a midfield pass at the start of the action.
He moved between three Brighton defenders before catapulting onto the free field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green jerseys.
He humiliated one defender before overtaking several others at the boundary of the Brighton area.
He then made a pass to the left, where he found Sterling.
The English striker used the first touch in the area to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a right shot into the net.
"Aguero is having problems with his foot," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he was able to score at that time."
But it was Sterling who initially led the Sky Blues in the fight for the Premier League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball deep into Brighton's court.
He sent a nice filter ball down his left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few steps before driving Sterling to the second pole.
The Sky Blues striker threw the ball into the net just before leaving the field.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play dirty against the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the playoffs, there was no reason to force another start.
But the as-yet-competitive Scherzer hopes to pitch Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, who retain a one-game advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies won at least one repechage with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but still hope to clinch their first-division title.
“Even if we play without a goal, at least we can be able to launch knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team that will play will probably be at the highest level this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to compete?”
The Nationals have yet to announce a first pitcher for Sunday, but are said to be inclined to let Scherzer pitch in such situations.
Scherzer, who would be first pitcher for the 34th time, performed a pitching session on Thursday and would be first pitcher on his normal Sunday off.
The Washington pitcher is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings for this season.
Trump at a rally in West Virginia
The President made indirect reference to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke of the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
It's one of the big, big -- I'm not a candidate but I'm really working for it, I'm fighting for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump continued, “We see this horrible group of radical Democrats, it’s happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power using any means necessary, you can see the meanness, pettiness.
They don’t care who they can hit, who they have to overwhelm in order to regain power and control, because that’s what they want, power and control and we’re not going to give it to them.”
The Democrats, he said, have given themselves the mission of “resisting and hindering.”
“And it’s been possible to see it in the last four days,” he said, calling Democrats “angry, mean, mean and lying.”
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee with Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, unleashing loud whistles among the public.
“Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, I'm looking forward to -- that was bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer very tolerant.
Does not tolerate people who say what they think
When Momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me, it wasn’t a big surprise.
After all, they are the latest in a series of Labour MPs who have been told they are not welcome, and all because they said what they thought.
My fellow Member Joan Ryan received similar treatment because he resolutely opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for expressing my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically all topics similar to those on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notice for Friday’s Nottingham East Labour meeting states that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of my eight years as a member of the local Labour Party parliament, Friday night meetings were exactly like this.
Yet today this is not the tone of numerous meetings and the promise of a "kinder and more courteous" policy has long since been forgotten, if ever remembered.
It has become increasingly obvious that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and any opinion is judged on whether or not it is acceptable for party leadership.
This all began shortly after Jeremy became party leader, and colleagues with whom I previously thought I shared a similar political vision began to expect a turnaround on my part and that I would take positions I would never accept, whether it was national security or the European single market.
When I speak in public – and it doesn’t really matter what I say – there follow invectives of insults on social media calling for my withdrawal, denouncing the politics of the centre and telling me that I shouldn’t be part of the Labour party.
And it's not just my experience.
I certainly know that I am luckier than other colleagues of mine because direct comments to me tend to be political in nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a torrent of insults with a sexist or racist background every day but who do not let themselves be intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of insult levels.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer in a tolerant environment and with every motion of no-confidence or modification of the rules of selection, the party shrinks.
In the last two years I have been given a lot of advice, inviting me to lower my head, not to express my opinions so openly and everything "would have gone well".
But that’s not why I got into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a pupil, provoked by the carelessness of the Thatcher government that had left my high school class literally falling apart, I have tried to defend better public services for those who need them most, as a local councillor or government minister.
I never hid my political views, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been in any way baffled by my political positions and points of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who moved the motion on Friday, I would like to say that when the country is rushing towards a Brexit that will damage households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy talking about my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But in reality the only message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of exclusion or political opportunity will stop me from acting in defence of what I believe to be your best interests.
Chris Leslie is Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: undefeated Ayr climbs the leaderboard
Two late attempts may have somehow unbalanced the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved the triumph in this exceptionally entertaining match of Tennent’s championship day.
They are now at the top of the standings, the only undefeated team out of ten.
In the end it was their superior defense, as well as their audacity, that pushed the home team and coach Peter Murchied had every reason to be satisfied.
“We’ve been tested in our games so far and we’re still unbeaten, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "You have to acknowledge Ayr's merit, they took better advantage of the opportunities we had."
Grant Anderson's goal in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, but brought Ayr to the advantage, but a yellow card for Scottish player Rory Hughes, released by the Warriors for the game, allowed Melrose to speak the numbers and Jason Baggot grabbed an unconverted goal.
Climo increased the distance of the Ayr with a penalty before, just at half time, to score and then convert a goal alone to bring the Ayr to 17-5 at the interval.
But Melrose got off to a good start in the second half and Baggot’s converted Patrick Anderson’s goal reduced the lead to five points.
There was therefore a long interruption due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was laid down, and on restart, the Ayr jumped back into the lead thanks to a goal by Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
Ayr's substitute captain Blair Macpherson was then given a yellow card and Melrose charged the man extra with an unconverted goal from Bruce Colvine, at the end of a moment of strong pressure.
The home team returned, however, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for a no-ball, penalty-taking clash with Climo, MacPherson scored a touchdown behind Ayr's advancing scrum.
Climo converted, as he had almost done since the restart, after Rowe had picked up the kick from the David Armstrong area and sent flanker Gregor Henry to look for the home team's fifth goal.
Star of Still Game seeks a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran has decided to move into the hospitality industry after discovering he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he writes and stars alongside longtime partner Greg Hemphill.
The couple has announced that the next ninth series will also be the show’s definitive one, and it looks like Kiernan is thinking about a life after Craiglang.
According to lists of official reports, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment, though a Scottish Sun source said Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow’s “prosperous restaurant business.”
'"The sea is ours": Bolivia landlocked hopes that a court will reopen the path to the Pacific
Sailors patrol a rigged naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings display an ocean blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are decorated with the motto: "The sea is ours by right.
Recovering it is a duty.”
Throughout landlocked Bolivia, the memory of the lost coast and now in Chile’s hands after a bloody conflict over resources in the 19th century is still alive, as is the desire to sail the Pacific Ocean once again.
These hopes have perhaps reached the highest level in decades, while Bolivia awaits the decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and obviously is waiting for the result with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the International Court of Justice ruling on big screens across the country, in the hope that the Hague tribunal will welcome Bolivia's claim that - after decades of intermittent dialogue - Chile is obliged to negotiate, granting Bolivia an outlet to the sea within the competence of the state.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president — who is facing a controversial re-election battle next year — has a lot at stake in Monday’s ruling.
“We are very close to our return to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised in late August.
But some analysts believe that the court will hardly rule in favor of Bolivia and that little would change if it did.
The UN body based in the Netherlands has no power to allocate Chilean territory and has specified that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the International Court of Justice ruling comes just six months after the final arguments indicates that the case ‘was not complicated,’ said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And far from advancing the Bolivian cause, the past four years may have delayed it.
"The problem of access to the sea has been monopolized by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morale’s belligerent rhetoric has blunted any remaining good intentions of Chile, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but it will be very difficult to maintain discussions in the wake of what has happened.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision-making process was particularly swift.
On Monday, Bolivia will be able to “enjoy extraordinary opportunities in relations with Chile” and will have the opportunity to “end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefit,” he explained.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – is using the maritime issue as political swindle.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he said.
“The ruling is an opportunity to see that we need to move beyond the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won’t happen without trust in U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has said his nation will never disarm from nuclear weapons unless it can trust Washington first.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to abide by the promises made during the Singapore summit between the two rival leaders.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears intent on restarting stalled diplomatic talks after meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri explains that it is an “illusion” that continued sanctions and U.S. opposition to a declaration of an end to the Korean War can ever bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is wary of releasing the statement without Pyongyang carrying out major disarmament actions first.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is willing to give up an arsenal that the country probably considers the only way to ensure its own security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
The Parisian fashion shows present the latest trend in huge headdresses that will soon be in a high fashion store near you
If you want to expand your collection of headgear or completely block out the sun’s rays, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have unveiled on catwalks a series of crazy oversized headdresses for their spring-summer 2019 collection that impressed the fashion world at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats have been raging on Instagram this summer and these designers have sent their eye-catching creations to the catwalk.
Valentino’s main piece was an exaggerated beige hat decorated with a broad feather-like border that submerged the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included jeweled watermelons, a sorcerer’s hat, and even a pineapple – but they weren’t designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of these colorful masks have sewn lips and look more like a representation of Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation resembled a diving suit with a mask and goggles, while another looked like a melted ice cream cone.
And if you go on with the huge style statements, you’re in luck.
Style observers predict that huge caps could reach you in the streets of high fashion.
The outsize hats come in the wake of "The Bomb", the straw hat with a brim width of more than a meter that has been seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the very impractical hat that has invaded social media has sent another huge creation on the catwalk: a straw beach bag almost as big as the costume model who wears it.
The burnt orange raffia bag, finished with raffia fringes and a white leather handle was the highlight of Jacquemus' La Riviera spring-summer 2019 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect these big hats and beach bags to hit luxury stores next summer, as the designer has made such an impact that it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scottish independent schools maintain a curriculum of academic excellence and this continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding exam results, reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other collective endeavours.
With over 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the best level of service to their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further higher education, career choice and their place in the world as global citizens.
As an education sector able to develop and adopt a personalized school curriculum, we observe that modern languages continue to be a popular and in-demand subject within schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, the message will reach his brain.
If you speak to him in his native language, the message will reach the heart."
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English alone if we wish to build trusting relationships with people from other countries.
From the results of this year’s exams, we can see that languages are at the top of the rankings, with the highest success rates within independent schools.
68% of the pupils who studied foreign languages obtained the highest marks.
The data, collected from the 74 SCIS member schools, showed that 72% of students obtained the highest praise grade in Chinese, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish obtained the maximum grade.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are promoting foreign languages as core skills for children and young people, who will undoubtedly need them in the future.
Currently, languages, as a choice of subject, are considered at the same level as STEM subjects (science, technology, technique and mathematics) in the curricula of independent institutions and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that the reasons employees indicated for difficulty in covering jobs were attributable in 17% of cases to a lack of language skills.
For this reason, language skills are becoming increasingly essential to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more job opportunities requiring language skills, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of your chosen career, if you have learned a second language, you will have an effective advantage in the future with a life-long competence like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will bring a multilingual person automatically ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of over 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% were unable to speak a foreign language to a level sufficient to sustain a conversation and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15%.
That is why investing in language teaching is so important for children today.
Knowledge of several languages, in particular those of developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding a good job.
In Scotland, each school will differ in the languages taught.
Several schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK looking to 2020, such as Mandarin Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interests, there will always be several languages to choose from in independent schools, with teaching staff specialised in this area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills necessary for success, whatever their future may be.
It is not possible to deny at this time, in a global trading system, that languages continue to be fundamental to the future of the country, and this must be reflected in teaching.
In fact, modern languages should be considered “international communication skills.”
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It has to be done.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron to make Lakers debut in San Diego on Sunday
The wait is almost over for fans who are waiting for LeBron James to make his first inning with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday’s pre-season opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it has yet to be established how many minutes he will play.
“It’s going to be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play for a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
“At this point in my career I don’t need friendly matches to prepare for it,” he said.
Trump's West Virginia rally time, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump kicks off tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia at a barrage of rallies.
This is the first of five meetings planned for Trump next week, including stops in friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote pending for his choice to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court, Trump will seek to build support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress in the November election.
What time will Trump’s rally be and how is it possible to follow him online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, Sept. 29, 2018.
You can follow Trump’s West Virginia rally online via livestreaming on YouTube.
Trump will likely talk about this week’s hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which have become tense because of sexual assault allegations with an early confirmation vote by the Senate pending for a week as the FBI conducts investigations.
But the main purpose of this series of rallies is to help Republicans facing the November election get some traction.
So President Trump’s campaign said these five rallies over the next week are aimed at “energizing volunteers and supporters as Republicans seek to protect and expand the majorities they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Congress control is so critical to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we head into the busiest season of the campaign,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters, asking to remain anonymous.
Scheduled for Wheeling's Wesbanco Arena, tonight's rally could draw supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract media coverage of Pittsburgh," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump will visit West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is trailing in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come and try to give him a boost in the polls,” Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows courage to fight to keep hopes alive until Sunday's singles
After three one-way sessions, Saturday afternoon quartets may have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum motion is a totally invented sports concept in which players firmly believe and never like in races like these.
So where would the bike be now?
“They had a six-point lead and now it’s four, so I would say we’re keeping a little bit of momentum,” Jordan Spieth said as he pulled away at the end of the day.
Europe is in the lead, of course, four points ahead with another twelve at stake.
Americans feel they have a bit of a headwind, as Spieth said, and they have a lot to be hopeful about, not least in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who have been playing together all day and each has three points out of four.
Spieth has been ruthless from tee to green and is leading by example.
The guttural cheers of celebration grew louder as the game went on, sinking a crucial putt to even the score at Game Four, when he and Thomas were under two points after two.
His putt that made them win the game at the 15th hole was greeted with a similar scream, which tells you that he believes the American team is not yet out of the race.
"You really have to worry about your game," Spieth said.
That’s all any of these players can do now.
18 holes to make a point.
The only players with more points from Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the irrefutable version of the Ryder Cup.
Europe’s strange but adorable couple is four-for-four and can’t do anything wrong.
"Moliwood" were the only pair not to pull a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the ninth hole on Friday morning.
That course, and the way their energy seems to flow to and from the boisterous crowd consolidates the certainty that they are the players to beat on Sunday, and there wouldn’t be a more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to seal an eventual European win as the sun sets on Le Golf National.
Preferably both simultaneously on different holes.
However, European glory speeches are still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson soon caught up with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning four-ball, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double bogets on the first nine holes sank the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole from which they were not even remotely able to climb.
However, on Sunday there is no one to help you get out of your hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to watch closely because of the interactions between couples, the advice they give and don’t give, and the way the strategy can change at a moment’s notice.
Europe have played better as a team so far and gained an important advantage on the final day but this foursome session showed that the USA team has the courage to fight, which some, in particular Stateside, have doubted.
Europe with a 10-6 lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a solid lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup after finishing Saturday’s fourball and foursome games with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two wins over a struggling Tiger Woods to bring the score so far at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn’s European team, in an attempt to retain the trophy lost to Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an irregular American team in the morning fourball, winning 3-1.
The U.S. resisted more in the foursome, winning two games, but failed to recover the disadvantage.
Jim Furyk’s team needs eight points from 12 singles games on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, known as "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points from the opening four games in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they worked superbly to beat a downed Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even sharper 5&4.
Woods, who trailed for two games on Saturday, showed occasional flashes of genius but lost 19 of his 29 games in the fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting during the morning fourballs, returned alongside partner Henrik Stenson in the foursome to beat 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – number one and three in the world rankings.
Europe, however, has not achieved all the results it hoped for on a pleasant and breezy day south-west of Paris.
The three-time big winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They scored a gritty 2&1 victory over Spain’s Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursome, having lost the opening two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team come back from a four-point deficit passing the singles, although as a starter, Furyk’s team only needs a draw to defend the trophy.
After being second best for two days, however, a counterattack on Sunday seems to be out of their reach.
North Korea Refuses to Unilateral Disarmament Without Trust
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that maintaining sanctions was exacerbating the country’s mistrust of the United States, which in such circumstances would absolutely refuse to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN General Assembly that North Korea had taken "important goodwill measures" over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site and committing to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“However, we do not see any compliant response from the US,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no security in our national security, and in such circumstances we absolutely refuse to unilaterally disarm first.”
Although Ri repurposed the complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phased” denuclearization with which North Korea would be rewarded based on gradual actions, his statement was important because he did not reject unilateral denuclearization in its entirety as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump during the first-ever meeting between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader, held in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work toward the “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,” while Trump promised guarantees to North Korean security.
North Korea has sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also opposed calls to ease tough international sanctions on North Korea.
“The US insists on the need to ‘have denuclearisation first’ and to increase the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve their purpose in a coercive way and even opposes the ‘declaration of an end to the war,’” Ri said.
“The idea that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an illusion of those who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions is increasing our mistrust.”
Ri made no reference to plans for a second meeting between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader had announced at the U.N. earlier this week.
The minister instead pointed out the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past 5 months and added: "If the counterpart of this denuclearization issue were South Korea and not the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be at this point dead."
But even so, the tone of Ri’s speech was markedly different from last year’s speech at the UN General Assembly, when he said it was inevitable to target US territory with North Korean missiles after “evil president” Trump called Kim a “missile man” engaged in a suicide mission.
Ahead of the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, heaped praise on Kim for his courage in embarking on the path of disarmament, but said much more had to be done and sanctions would remain in place until North Korea was denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he doesn’t have a deadline, saying “if it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia say the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that "compliance with Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without exception until complete, final and proven denuclearization is achieved."
The Security Council unanimously backed sanctions on North Korea in 2006 in an attempt to stifle funding for nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again the following month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea already three times this year, but the last trip did not go well.
He departed Pyongyang in July saying progress had been made, but a few hours later North Korea accused him of making “gangster demands.”
North Korea had pledged during a meeting this month with Moon to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the U.S. took "conforming measures."
He said Kim had explained to him that the “conforming measures” he wanted were security guarantees Trump had committed to in Singapore and actions toward a normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has pushed all its students to sleep more in an attempt to counter the growing manly culture of studying for whole nights fed on caffeine.
One university scholar found that students at the world’s number one university often have no idea of the basic concepts of self-care.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, developed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the U.S.
He had the idea to start the course after a lecture he had given on the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
“Finally a girl came to me and said, ‘Why am I only being told this now, when I’m senior year?’
She said no one had ever told her anything about the importance of sleep, which surprised me a lot," she told The Telegraph.
The course, taught for the first time this year, explains to students the essential concepts of how good sleep-related habits can help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the university’s director general of health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students suffered from a severe lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive activities.
In one section there is an image of a dormitory room, where students can select coffee cups, curtains, sneakers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep, and the importance of an evening routine.
In another section, participants are explained how lack of long-term sleep can increase the risks of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A campus map, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not immediately change the behavior of students.
But we believe that they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes," added Prof. Czeisler.
The culture of pride tied to the “night out studying” still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students lead to lack of sleep being an ever-growing problem.
Getting enough sleep and having good quality sleep should be the students’ “secret weapon” to combat stress, fatigue, anxiety, explained and even should serve to avoid gaining weight as lack of sleep brings the brain into starvation mode, making people constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student enrolled in the faculty of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler develop the course, after taking one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He explained that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to promote a campus-wide course.
The next step, he hopes, will be to ask all graduate students to follow a similar program of study before enrolling at this competitive institution.
Prof. Czeisler advised students to set an alarm for when they have to go to bed, as well as for when they have to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can tilt the circadian rhythm, leading to sleeping problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal knocks down Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another bout of depression from outside the home with Dolly Menga's goal relegating Steven Gerrard's disjointed team to a 1-0 loss at Livingston.
Ibrox's side were looking for their first away win since a 4-1 win at St Johnstone on February 4, but Gary Holt's team inflicted Gerrard's second loss in 18 games as coach leaving his team eight points behind the fleeing leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership, the Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before halftime and a Rangers formation short of inspiration never seemed able to even up.
While the Ranger now drops to sixth place, Livingston rises to third, and only behind Hibernian by goal difference.
And there could be more trouble coming for the Rangers after lineman Calum Spence was treated for a head injury due to an object apparently thrown from the side outside the home.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which quickly overtook Ayr in the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, picked the usual lineup that tore a point out of Hearts last week and would have been pleased with the way his well-prepared team stifled their opponents on every lap.
Rangers may have dominated for ball possession but Livingston made better use of the balls at their disposal.
They could have scored just after two minutes when Menga's pass in the first half sent Scott Pittman ahead towards Allan McGregor's goal but the midfielder wasted the opportunity.
A deep free kick from Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett but his defending teammate Alan Lithgow could only pull to the side on the second post.
The Rangers took control but there seemed to be more hope than conviction in their play in the penalty area.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should be given a penalty at the end of the fifteenth following a clash with Steven Lawless but referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's requests.
Rangers only managed to shoot twice in the first half but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was unconcerned by Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's bland shot.
Although Livingston’s opening goal in the 34th minute may have been unexpected, no one can deny that he deserved it just for his commitment.
Again the Rangers failed to manage a deep-seated kick from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher filtered the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool in choosing Menga for a clean conclusion.
Gerrard acted during the interval replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the change had an almost immediate impact since the wing put a ball into Morelos, but the exceptional Kelly threw himself from the goal line to block it.
But Livingston continued to drag visitors into exactly the kind of game they love, with Lithgow and Halkett picking up one long ball after another.
Holt's team may have increased the gap in the final stages, but McGregor resisted to stop Jacobs before Lithgow pulled out of the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton made one final penalty request after a cross with Jacobs but Thomson denied it again.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today and the COUNT continues... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that made the device known as the Geiger counter.
A staple of science ever since, the Geiger counter also became a pillar of pop culture, when in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," played by those unbelievably cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to detect radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put on these earbuds you can really feel the effects of the atoms released by the radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: "Say something, it's just popping now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Immune System to ‘See’ Malignant Cells
New cancer vaccine may teach immune system to ‘see’ malignant cells and kill them
Vaccine Teaches Immune System to Recognize Malignant Cells as Part of Treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, and altering them in the laboratory.
They can then "see" a protein common to many types of cancer and are then re-injected.
An experimental trial of this vaccine is giving promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for over 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory so that they can “see” a protein common to numerous types of cancer, called HER2, and then those cells are injected again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the US National Cancer Institute based in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
The HER2 protein "promotes the growth of several types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, Berzofsky said.
A similar procedure of extracting immune cells from patients to "teach" them how to target cancer cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West throws himself into a pro-Trump rant wearing a MAGA (Make America Great Again) cap after his appearance on SNL.
It didn't go well
Kanye West was booed in the studio during a Saturday Night Live episode after a blistering performance during which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run in 2020.
After performing his third song of the evening, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a MAGA cap, he began a rampage against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"So many times I talk to white people and they say, 'How do you like Trump, he's a racist!'
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
SNL kicked off the show with a scene starring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee against allegations of sexual assault brought by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, West's recording of the song was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear if Rock was trying to tease West with the release.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had had a bad time backstage because of his headdress.
“I was bullied backstage.
They told me ‘don’t go out with that cap on.’
They bullied me!
And so they told me I was an outcast," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the underwater place?" and said, "I would wear Superman's cloak because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go on?
Try love."
His comments booed at least twice from the audience and members of the SNL cast appeared embarrassed, Variety said, with one person telling the magazine: “A deadly silence has fallen on the studio.”
West had been invited as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend rapper Mac Miller had died a few days earlier.
West baffled many with a performance of the song I Love It, disguised as Perrier's bottle.
West received support from TPUSA conservative group leader Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR HEADING TO THE MASS."
But show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply "what he is and this is just wonderful."
“But I chose NOT to reward someone (by buying their music or their clothes or by supporting their ‘art’) who I believe is embracing a vomitable ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And so are we," he added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he is now "the person previously known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and is following in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper friend, Snoop Dogg called himself Snoop Lion and of course the late music legend Prince, who had changed his name to a symbol and then into the artist formerly known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as fighter Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, saying such on-screen soils often make guys believe they have to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he felt “something went wrong” and reflected on how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married the Game of Thrones co-star, 31, has admitted he cares a lot about this issue.
"Personally I worry, a lot at the moment - what was our mistake with masculinity?" he said.
“What did we teach men as they grew up in terms of the problem we are seeing now?”
Kit believes that television could be partially responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity thanks to its extremely masculine characters.
He continued: 'What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on TV, and in the streets, that makes kids think they have to be in this certain way of being a man?
I think this is one of the great dilemmas of our time – how can we change things?
Because obviously something went wrong for young people.’
During the interview, he also admitted that he will not be playing any Game of Thrones prequels or sequels once the series wraps up next summer, stating that he has "finished with battlefields and horses".
Starting in November, Kit will play the lead role in the revival of Sam Shepard’s True West, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he considers meeting his wife Rose the best thing that ever happened to Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife during this series, so she gave me my future family, and my life from now on,” he explained.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by these diseases, according to health authorities.
About 40,000 new cases were reported as early as the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases are due to sexual transmission, which marks a change from the past.
In some regions of China, HIV has spread in the past as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who have contracted HIV in this way has fallen to almost zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 units.
Sexual transmission of HIV is an urgent problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still widespread.
Because of the country’s traditional values, some studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are caused by inadequate protections during sexual intercourse within such relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government promised universal access to anti-HIV drugs as part of its commitment to managing the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a staffer leaked GOP senators’ data, and speaks of “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories.”
The U.S. congresswoman denounced on Saturday the accusations against a member of her staff regarding the publication of personal information of three U.S. Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of lawmakers.
The Democratic congresswoman from Los Angeles said the statements were fomented by pundits and websites of the “ultra-right wing.”
“Lies, lies and still despicable lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information would include the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was published online Thursday, released by an anonymous Capitol Hill official during a hearing of a panel of experts on sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Waters’ office and released information related to a Waters staff member.
“This baseless accusation is completely false and an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these false and biased allegations, was in no way responsible for the leak of such information.
This unfounded accusation is totally false and an absolute lie.”
Waters’ claim quickly generated online criticism from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is furious,” Fleischer wrote.
"This implies that he does not have the character to be a Member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn’t do, they don’t have to be angry.
It doesn’t have to be provocative.
You don't have to question the accuser's motives.
He must remain calm and serene."
Fleischer appeared to liken Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who had been accused by detractors of looking too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running to impeach Waters in the midterm elections, expressed his views on Twitter.
"Huge if confirmed," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office has alerted “competent authorities and law enforcement to these tendentious claims.
"We will ensure that those responsible are exposed," he continued, "and that they are held accountable for all their dangerous and harmful actions to all members of my staff."
Johnny English review strikes again - the spoof of the spy with an undersized Rowan Atkinson
It has now become customary to look for references to Brexit in every new film with a British twist and this seems applicable to this revival of Johnny English’s action comedy, which began in 2003 and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English – The Revival.
Will the veiled self-irony about how much we suck be the nation’s new export opportunity?
In any case, the incompetent rubber-faced Johnny English and his out-of-orbit eyes got his license to mess things up for the second time – and his name indicates more than anything that this is a comedic creation developed for countries of non-English-speaking cinema goers.
Obviously it is the foolish secret agent who despite his strange claims of glamour has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr Bean and a pinch of that kind who contributed with a single note to the Gloria moments theme of the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
It is a character based initially on the mysterious international traveler and man Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, which left chaos behind.
There are one or two nice moments in this latest release of Johnny English.
I liked Johnny English approaching the helicopter wearing medieval armor and the propellers briefly rattling against his helmet.
Atkinson’s gift for physical comedy is evident, but the humor seems rather undersized and oddly superfluous, particularly now that “serious” movie brands like 007 and Mission Impossible now offer comedy as an ingredient.
The humor seems aimed at children instead of adults and for me the crazy misadventures of Johnny English are not as original and targeted as the gags of the silent films of Atkinson when he plays Mr Bean.
The immutable present-day premise now is the fact that Britain is in serious danger.
A computer hacker has infiltrated the super secret web of British spies, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, to the dismay of the agent in charge, a sadly very small role for Kevin Eldon.
It’s the straw that breaks the camel’s back for a conceited and tormented prime minister, who is already suffering a meltdown of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does her best with this Teresa May-like character but there’s not much to work on in the script.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that every single active spy has been compromised and that she will have to call back someone already retired.
And that means clumsy Johnny English, who now works as a school principal in a chic establishment, but who also gives off-the-books classes on how to be an undercover agent: here you can appreciate some nice gags, when English offers a course in espionage like School of Rock.
English is thrown back into Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunites with his ailing former partner Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, married to a submarine commander, a high society girl role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
So the Batman and Robin of disasters for Her Majesty's secret services are back in action, to meet Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is falling dangerously into the net of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous adventures: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant; they unleash hell by sneaking into Volta's luxury yacht and English creates pure anarchy as he tries to use a virtual reality mask to get familiar with the interior of Volta's house.
All the scenes are certainly designed for the last sequence, but as graceful and exuberant as they are, there is quite a bit of children's TV throughout the story.
The whole thing is quite modest.
And as happened with the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but think: couldn’t the British film industry assign Rowan Atkinson a role that would do justice to his talent?
Labour denies it is working out a plan for Britons to be able to work four days a week but be paid for five days a week.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is considering a radical programme that would allow British citizens to work four days a week, despite being paid for five.
The party would like major companies to pass on the savings from the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by offering them an extra day of rest.
In this way the employees could enjoy a three-day weekend, keeping the same pay.
Some sources said the idea would be compatible with the party’s economic program and plans to tilt the country in favor of workers.
The move to a four-day day was endorsed by the trade union congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour party member told The Sunday Times: "By the end of the year we expect to announce a policy review."
“It won’t happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is an aspiration in line with the party’s approach to rebalancing the economy in favor of workers, as well as its overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week as part of the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration does not enjoy the unanimous support of the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day working week is not part of the party's political line and is not currently the subject of discussion."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week’s Labour conference to detail his vision of an economic socialist revolution.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from “faceless leaders” and “speculators” in public service businesses.
The shadow chancellor’s plans also imply that the current shareholders of the water distribution companies may not recover their entire share package, since the Labour government could make “deductions” on the basis of behaviour considered illegal.
It also confirmed plans to include employees on company boards and create inclusive equity funds, so as to transfer 10 per cent of private sector companies’ equity to employees, who end up pocketing annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell '60 Minutes' whether the FBI's Kavanaugh investigation could change their minds
The FBI’s investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his Supreme Court nomination by at least a week, and raises questions about whether the agency’s findings could influence any of the Republican senators in providing their support.
In an interview airing Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it's possible that the FBI will unearth something that could cause them to change their minds.
Kennedy appeared more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said that as I was going to the hearing, I said, I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after what had happened, that that accusation came out, I said, ‘Did you do it?’
It was resolute, determined, unequivocal.”
Graham’s vow, however, seems carved into the rock.
“I have clear ideas about Brett Kavanaugh and they could stand up to a bomb-proof accusation,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I do know this: Brett strenuously denied it,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And anyone you name couldn't prove it.
It's been 36 years.
I don’t see anything new changing.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that showcases a remarkable array of stars and has an equally remarkable mission: to end poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flocking to the Great Lawn of Central Park not only to enjoy performances like those of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the real purpose of the event, that of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert audience had to complete a series of tasks, or “actions,” such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or any other meaningful way to help raise awareness about their goal of eliminating poverty.
But exactly how successful has the Global Citizen Festival been now that there are 12 years left to achieve its intended purpose?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really a genuine way of persuading people to request a call to action, or is it just another example of so-called “clicktivism” – people who feel they really make a difference by simply signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have recorded more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters, strove for a bunch of different purposes.
It says these actions have helped urge world leaders to announce more than $37 billion in commitments and policies that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 pledges and announcements stemming from their actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or used as funds.
The group estimates that protected capital funds have so far had a direct impact on about 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers committed to “helping children grow to their fullest potential,” with a pledge to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help eliminate malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens just like you, we can make social injustice or malnutrition a footnote in history,” said Tracey Ullman, ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were put in place calling on the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children through nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the FAQs on their website, they asked, “What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen responded: “It will be a long and arduous journey – sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of those who will perform at this year’s event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use Navy to implement "a blockade" and hinder Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
Washington can, “if necessary,” turn to its Navy to prevent Russian energy sources from being available on the market, including in the Middle East, U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said.
Zinke asserted that Russian involvement in Syria – in particular, where it is operating at the invitation of the legitimate government – is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I think the reason they're in the Middle East is because they want to negotiate for energy just like they do in Eastern Europe, the southern core of Europe," he said.
And, according to officials, there are ways and means to deal with it.
“The United States has the opportunity, thanks to the Navy, to ensure that the nautical routes remain open and, if necessary, to implement a naval blockade, so that their energy is not put on the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed attendees at the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit organization that calls itself the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He compared Washington’s strategies to negotiations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are, in fact, the same thing.
“The economic option on Iran and Russia is, more or less, to leverage and replace fuels,” he said, referring to Russia as “unversatile,” with an economy that relies on fossil fuels.
The statements were made because the Trump administration has been involved in a mission to boost the export of its liquid natural gas to Europe, and replace Russia, which for European consumers is by far the cheapest option.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to pull out of Nord Stream 2, the “inappropriate” pipeline project that, according to Trump, has made Berlin a “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly pointed out that Nord Stream 2, a $11 billion pipeline designed to double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin objects that Washington’s fervent opposition to the project is driven simply by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a September meeting in Moscow with Rick Perry, US Secretary of Energy.
The U.S. position has sparked a backlash from Germany, which has reconfirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s top industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States to stay out of the European Union’s energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I see as a big problem the fact that a third state interferes in our energy supply,” Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) said following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take 'serious consideration' of running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would “seriously consider” running for president following the midterm elections.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed he was contemplating running.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix our battered government, and that means having a woman at the top,” he said, according to The Hill.
“After November 6, I will seriously consider running for president.”
During the town hall assembly Warren said his about President Donald Trump, declaring that he was “taking this country in the wrong direction.”
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren was explicit in criticizing Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, who he nominated to the Supreme Court.
On Friday, Warren wrote in a tweet: "It is only natural that we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
A poll released on Thursday, however, showed that a majority of Warren’s own voters do not believe he should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of “probable” voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
32 percent supported such a candidacy.
The poll garnered greater support for a candidacy from former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a potential candidacy and 48 percent opposed.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed regarding a potential 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden has said he will make an official decision by January, as reported by The Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin’s post-traumatic stress disorder at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“What my son is going through, what he’s going through after he’s back, I can relate to other families that are experiencing the consequences of post-traumatic stress disorder and some of the injuries that our soldiers are coming back with,” he told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest “the elephant in the room” and said of his son and other war veterans, “they come back a little different, hardened, wondering if there is that respect for which their fellow soldiers and pilots, and every other member of the military, have consecrated themselves to the country.”
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with assault and domestic violence on a woman, which interferes with a relationship for domestic violence and possession of a gun under drugs, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and the District of Columbia support the challenge for new asylum policies
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal battle against a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the District of Columbia filed an amicus curiae brief in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker challenging that policy, as reported by NBC News.
The plaintiff’s full name in the Grace v. Sessions appeal that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy was not disclosed.
She said her partner “and her violent children gang members” abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum request on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Prosecutors supporting Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a vast number of asylum seekers in the United States, as nations facing rampant problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed asylum applications to undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence.
On Friday, District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal and international law.”
“Federal law requires that all asylum claims be adjudicated on the basis of the particular events and circumstances of the claim, and such a ban violates that principle,” the amicus brief states.
In the memo, prosecutors also objected that the policy banning the entry of immigrants harms the U.S. economy, stating the clear probability that they become entrepreneurs and "provide necessary labor."
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
“Asylum is accessible to those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality, membership of certain social groups or political opinion,” Sessions said in a statement.
Kindergarten has never been designed to alleviate every problem -- even all the serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
Desperate recovery efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was becoming increasingly desperate.
“There is a lot of tension,” said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she comforted her feverish little child at an evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
“At any given moment there is an ambulance carrying bodies.
Clean water is scarce."
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, rummaging through their soggy belongings, in an attempt to recover whatever they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospitals, damaged by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, a victim of a fractured shoulder and back, were resting outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were being treated outside due to the continued strong aftershocks.
His eyes filled with tears as he recounted the feeling of the violent earthquake shaking the room he shared with his wife and daughter on the fifth floor of a hotel.
"There was no time to save us.
“I got crushed in the rubble of the wall, I think,” Haris told The Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to you and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of 'doing bullies' with 'advertising propaganda'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page advertisement in a U.S. newspaper advertising the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press for propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the ad paid for by the China Daily in the Des Moines Register — the highest-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa — after accusing China of trying to interfere in the Nov. 6 U.S. congressional election, an accusation that China rejects.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to meddle in the U.S. election underscored what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently embroiled in an escalating trade war that has seen them adapt their tariffs to their respective imports.
China’s retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were meant to hit exporters in states like Iowa, which backed Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and previously the longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an op-ed in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, “now ramps up that bullying by publishing advertising propaganda in our free newspapers.”
“In disseminating its propaganda, the Chinese government is using America’s beloved tradition of freedom of speech and press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
Vice versa, in the newsstand on the road here in Beijing you will find few dissident voices and you will not see any real reflection of the disparate opinions that the Chinese population might have about China’s problematic economic trajectory, given that the media is under the firm grip of the Chinese Communist Party.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers has evaded an offer to publish" his article, although he did not state what the paper was about.
Republicans are alienating female voters ahead of midterm elections with the Kavanaugh case, analysts warn
Given that many top Republicans are defending Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court and are on his side in facing various sexual harassment charges, analysts have signaled that there will be a backlash, especially from women, over the course of future midterm elections.
The unrest in this regard has been extremely high, and many Republicans have already officially shown that they want to go ahead with a vote.
“You can’t take these things back,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake’s last-minute insistence on an FBI investigation will be enough to appease angry voters.
“Women won’t forget what happened yesterday — they won’t forget tomorrow or in November,” Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, said Friday, according to the Washington, D.C., newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters repeated the slogan "November is coming!" during their protest in the Senate chamber, when Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee chose to continue with Kavanaugh's candidacy despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, as reported by Mic.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats is skyrocketing,” Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news site.
“People say they were already tall; it’s true.
But they could be higher, especially among the undecided electricians of the suburbs and young voters, between 18 and 29, who often do not vote even though they do not like the president.
Even before Ford’s public testimony, which provided details of his sexual harassment allegations against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts had speculated that a backlash could have occurred if Republicans continued with the confirmation.
“For the GOP it’s become a confusing whole,” Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the vote for the committee, the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be benched, it’s also about the way Republicans handled the situation and the way they treated her,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
In any case, Americans seem to be somehow divided between the person to believe following Ford and Kavanaugh’s testimony, with a smaller percentage in favor of the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent say they certainly or probably believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh likely or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flake’s insistence, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one of the other accusers, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Last week, Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh assaulted her in a state of intoxication when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee exposed her genitals during a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a New Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that seeks to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology legend’s latest project, Inrupt, is a company that traces its origins to Berners-Lee’s open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and what people will have access to and what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt is “to dominate the world.”
“We have to do it now,” he said of the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own “online personal data store” or POD.
It can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify were all available on one browser at the same time.
The uniqueness of the online personal data store is that it is completely up to the user who can have access to what type of information.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through data.”
The idea for Inrupt, according to John Bruce, CEO of the company, is to bring adequate resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some staff developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, tech programmers around the world will be able to bring their decentralized apps to life using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team will not tell “Facebook and Google whether or not to introduce a complete change where their business models are completely derailed overnight.
“We’re not asking for their permission.”
In a Medium post published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that “Inrupt’s mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built from Solid.”
In 1994 Berners-Lee transformed the internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the net neutrality debate.
Even after the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Commemorated the ecclesiastic of the Great War with Victoria Cross
The only Church of England clergyman to be awarded a Victoria Cross during World War I as a fighter was commemorated in his hometown after 100 years.
The lieutenant colonel, Reverend Bernard Vann, obtained recognition on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper and never knew that he had achieved the highest level of British military honour.
On Saturday at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, his two grandchildren unveiled a commemorative plaque.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was “magnificently symbolic” that the stone would be inaugurated exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s award-winning feat.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Van led his battalion across the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a dense fog, under heavy camp fire and war machines".
Then he rushed toward the line of fire and with "greatest gallantry" advanced the line before running with a single-handed cannon and landing three of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - just one month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I can never live up to and something that makes me more humble.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a wreath after the parade, conducted by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he "felt really honored to play a role in the parade" and added "the value of a real hero is demonstrated by the support that will be given to him by so many people."
MMA fans stood up all night to watch Bellator 206, and instead caught Peppa Pig
Just imagine, you stayed up all night looking at the famous Bellator 206 only to be denied a view of the main event.
The show from San Jose included 13 fights, including six on the main card, and was to be broadcast in the UK overnight, live on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to clash, viewers in the UK were stunned when Peppa Pig appeared on screen.
Some stayed grounded after staying up until the wee hours of the morning specifically for combat.
One fan on Twitter described the move to children's cartoons as "a kind of bad-taste prank".
“The government’s regulation is that at 6 a.m. that content was no longer appropriate, so we had to move to children’s programming,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Pepp the pig," "yes."
Bellator chairman Scott Coker said: “We will be working on programming to include viewers from the UK in the future.
“I think when I think about replay, I think we can probably find a solution,” Coker said.
“But there it is at six in the morning on Sunday and we will not be able to find a solution before Sunday of our time zone, Monday for theirs.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the schedule changed a lot of messages came in and no one was friendly.
We were trying to solve the problem, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I promise you it won't happen next time.
We’re going to limit it to five fights instead of six – as we normally do – and we’ve tried to get so much for the fans, and we’ve just discussed it.
It's an unpleasant situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" because of sexuality
Olympic swimmer Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to anyone because of his sexuality – but this provided him with the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize until he got to high school that “not everyone is like me.”
Speaking on the first episode of Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he had made his voice heard about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also stated that becoming a parent meant that he cared less about winning the Olympics.
The regular host of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, took a series of sick months off.
Posing as an outcast on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "less than" anyone else while growing up because "it wasn't socially acceptable that he liked both boys and girls."
He said, “These days, the feeling of feeling less than, and feeling different, were the things that really gave me the strength and energy to be successful.”
She wanted to try to be “something,” she said, so as not to disappoint anyone if they happened to find out about her sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medallist became a high-profile LGBT activist and used his face at this year’s Australian Commonwealth Games to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he made his voice heard because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to give “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man - US director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "took me by surprise".
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but said the age difference was never an issue.
“When you go through so much at a young age” — he went to his first Olympics when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later — he said it was hard to find someone the same age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The two became parents in June to a child named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole perspective" has changed.
“If you asked me last year, it was all about the fact that ‘I had to win a gold medal,’” he said.
“You know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said her father had not accepted the fact that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked was if they already had tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘You’re not going to be around here so you can be in the front row, Dad,’” she said.
“I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and until he actually stopped and died, I hadn’t realized yet that he wasn’t invincible,” she said.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics, winning bronze.
“I just knew it was what I had dreamed of all my life – swimming in front of a home crowd in the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling,” he said.
This also inspired the choice of his first song - Heather Small's Proud - which had a special meaning for him in preparation for the Olympics and still makes him goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson out of shape benched in Saturday's Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to get back in shape to prevent it from becoming an unhappy milestone.
Mickelson, playing in the biennial event for a record twelfth time, was benched by captain Jim Furyk for the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as it has often been for the United States, the five-time champion spent the day between cheerleading and working on his own game in the range, hoping to correct what tormented him.
Having never been the strongest driver even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the difficult Le Golf National, where the bumpy course regularly punishes the wrong shots.
And if the path itself wasn’t discouraging enough, Mickelson, in Sunday’s ninth match, faces accurate British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, four points down at the start of their 12 individual matches, start with a hot start, Mickelson’s match could prove to be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, not that he could say much else.
“He fully understood the role he had today, patted me on the shoulder, put an arm around me and said he would be ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He’s a Hall of Famer and he’s added so much to the teams in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't imagine playing two games.
I had imagined more, but this is the way it went and this is the way we thought it should go.
He wants to participate, just like anyone else.”
Mickelson will break Nick Faldo’s record for most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
It could mark the end of a career in the Ryder Cup that has never even remotely mirrored the heights of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 games won, 20 losses and seven draws, though Furyk said his presence brought intangibles to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, witty, he likes to make fun of people, and he’s a great guy to have in the boardroom,” she explained.
“I also think the younger players had fun playing against him this week, which was fun to watch.
He did a lot more than play.”
Europe captain Thomas Bjorn knows a good lead can soon fade
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows from experience that a considerable advantage in individual matches on the final day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable chase.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama where the team, captained by Seve Ballesteros, despite a five-point gap from the Americans, came to the finish line with a minimal lead, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“I keep telling myself that we had a good lead at Valderrama, we had it at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama where we won, but by little,” Bjorn said after seeing the 2018 class win, Friday 5-3 and yesterday 10-6, at Le Golf National.
“So it’s going to be history that shows me and my team that it’s not over.
Tomorrow we have to do our best.
You have to go out there and do everything the right way.
It's not over until the dots are marked on the board.
Our goal is to try to win the trophy, and that’s what we need to focus on.
I always focus on the 12 players on my team, but I know who’s on the other side: the best golfers in the world.”
Happy with the way his team competed on that difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never have outdone myself.
Tomorrow’s is a different challenge.
Tomorrow is the turn of individual performances, which is another thing.
It’s nice to be there with a teammate when things are going well, but when you’re just a golfer your golfing skills are put to the test.
This is the message that needs to be conveyed to the players: tomorrow, you have to bring out the best in yourself.
Then, you forget about your partner because he too has to go there and bring out the best in himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, counterpart Jim Furyk will look to his players for the best individual rather than team performance, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who collected three points out of four.
Furyk himself found himself on both sides in those big matches of the last day, having been part of the winning team at Brookline before losing to the European "Miracle of Medinah".
"I remember every single word," he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, led his players on the final day.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important games, but we want to start immediately with the right foot as we did in Brookline and Medinah.
When the game starts to take a certain turn, the pressure increases in the intermediate games.
So we organize our training accordingly and categorize the boys in the way that seems appropriate, because tomorrow we will try to do a magic.
Thomas was given the task of leading the counteroffensive and facing Rory McIlroy in the top match with, in order, the other Europeans, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, in the first half.
“I chose this order because I think it covers the path to the end,” Bjorn said of his selection for individual matches.
Germany’s new military ship has been delayed again
According to local media, the last frigate of the German Navy should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the old military ships of the time of the Cold War, but it will not be there at least until next year due to faulty systems and a surge in costs.
The commission of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the new Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit quoting a military spokesman.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014, but worrisome issues following delivery have plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class ships.
They will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some hidden technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic markings.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, in fact it should be possible to use the new frigates up to two years away from national ports.
However, the continuous delays imply that the innovative warships, which are said to allow Germany to project its power overseas, will already become obsolete when they enter service, Die Zeit notes.
The ill-fated Type F-125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the manufacturer after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media noted a number of crucial "software and hardware defects" that rendered the ship useless if employed on a combat mission.
The shortcomings in the software were particularly significant as the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ships will be manned by a crew of about 120 sailors, barely half the staff of the older Bremen-class ships.
In addition, it turned out that the ship weighs way too much, and this reduces its performance and limits the Navy’s ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is believed to be twice as heavy as similar-class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
Aside from faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project (including crew training) is also becoming an important issue.
It appears to have reached 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) from the initial 2.2 billion euros.
The problems involving the new frigates become of particular importance in light of recent alarms regarding the reduction of German naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Parliamentary Commissioner for the Armed Forces, admitted that the Navy actually “has few ships that can be used.”
The official said the issue has worsened considerably over time, since the old unarmed ships have not been replaced by new ships.
His regret is that none of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class frigates were able to join the Navy.
The National Trust spies on the secret life of bats
New research at a Scottish Highlands estate aims to reveal how bats use their sight to procure food.
The findings are expected to shed light on the behaviour of the only existing flying mammals and guide future conservation efforts.
The National Trust for Scotland scientists’ study will follow common and soprano bats, as well as brown eared and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the property to track the activities of the bats during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile investigations using portable detectors.
Analysis of recorded sounds by an expert will determine the frequency of bat calls and how each species behaves.
A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed, scaled-up picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation consultant for the NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how these are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as creating lawns, and how to best maintain forests for bats and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom has declined considerably in the last century.
Bats are at risk due to construction and development work affecting perches and ruining habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a threat, as can flypaper and some chemical treatments of building materials, in addition to domestic cat attacks.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to grabbing prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-localization technique to locate insects and obstacles on their trajectory.
The NTS, responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
Ten qualified experts regularly conduct investigations, inspect the perches and sometimes carry out rescues.
The organisation has even set up Scotland’s first bat-only reserve at the Threate estate in the Dumfries and Galloway region, which is home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
Estate manager David Thompson says the property is the ideal territory.
“Here at Threate we have a large area for bats,” he said.
“We have ancient buildings, many centuries-old trees and a good habitat.
But there’s a lot about bats that we don’t know yet, so the work we do here and at other properties will help us understand more about their growth needs.”
It stresses the importance of checking bats before conducting maintenance within properties as it is possible that unintentional destruction of a single maternal perch could kill up to 400 females and young, perhaps wiping out an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, harass them, disturb them or destroy their perches.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish head of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
He said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don’t know how their populations fare.”
Ronaldo rejects rape allegations as lawyers sue German weekly
Cristiano Ronaldo has labelled the rape allegations against him as "fake news", stating that people "want to advertise themselves" with his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German weekly Der Spiegel that published the allegations.
The Portuguese striker was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga at a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
Der Spiegel also made public on Friday the accusation of the payment of $ 375,000 to maintain silence on the incident.
In a video on Instagram directed at his 142 million followers, in the hours following the allegations, Ronaldo, 33, slammed the claims as “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false,” says the five-time Ballon d’Or staring at the camera.
“They want to advertise through my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by making my name, but that’s part of the game.
I’m happy and everything is fine,” the footballer added with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they call “an inadmissible reporting of suspicions in the private sphere.”
Attorney Christian Schertz said the footballer will seek compensation for “moral damages to the extent corresponding to the gravity of the breach of privacy, considered, probably, one of the most serious of personal rights in recent years”.
The event took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly returned to the player's room, where he subjected her to anal violence, according to statements filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga said Ronaldo would have fallen to his knees after the incident, saying he was for the "99 percent" a "good guy" disappointed by the "one percent".
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that the two had had sexual intercourse, but that this was consensual.
Mayorga said she went to the police and the hospital, where her injuries were photographed, but later agreed to a settlement as she felt "terrified by the retaliation" and worried about the prospect of "being publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old is now trying to overturn the deal, claiming she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of moving to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the incident, and this summer he will join Italy’s Juventus on a €100 million contract.
Brexit: the UK will regret forever the loss of car manufacturers
The UK “may regret forever” the loss of its status as the world’s leading carmaker following Brexit, Industry Minister Greg Clark said.
He added that he was "concerned" about Toyota UK's comments to the BBC about Britain leaving the EU without a deal and the resulting temporary halt to production at the Burnaston plant near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese automaker argues that delays at the borders, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, could affect jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which builds the Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced about 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I believe that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our factory will stop,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s managing director at Burnaston.
It raises concerns among other British car manufacturers about leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade works, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, claims that after Brexit it will close its Mini plants in Oxford for a month.
The main concern is the risks in the supply chain encountered by manufacturers in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is run on a “just in time” basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from UK and European suppliers for custom cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, border disruptions could occur that would cause delays and shortages of parties.
It would be impossible for Toyota to hold more than a day's worth of inventory at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production would be halted.
Minister Clark says Theresa May's plan for future relations with the EU is "designed precisely to avoid these border disruptions".
"We need a deal. We want to have the best deal that will allow us to enjoy not only the current success but to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
“The proof, not only from Toyota but also from other car manufacturers, is that we absolutely must be able to continue what has been a very successful supply chain.”
Toyota has not been able to say how long production could stop but, in the long run, warns that the additional costs could reduce the competitiveness of the plants and potentially jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the plant’s head of union delegates, says workers are deeply concerned: “In my experience, once jobs are reduced, they are no longer reinstated.”
A government spokesman said: "We have proposed a precise and credible plan for future relations with the EU."
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, White House says.
Donald Trump’s high-stakes meeting with Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed by a week,” as the dispute over Judge Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller investigating Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump advisers and Russia, and the president’s possible obstacle to justice.
The possibility that Trump could fire the deputy justice minister, thus jeopardizing Mueller’s independence, has fueled Washington’s gossip for months.
During the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was talking about wearing a bug to record conversations with Trump and trying to remove the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday he went to the White House and was rumored to be resigning.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the time at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Wednesday.
Trump said he would “prefer not” to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid an overlap with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing at which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week of inquiries from the FBI against Kavanaugh, further delaying the final Senate vote.
On Sunday, Trump spokeswoman Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "No date has been set, it could be this week, I guess it will be postponed for another week considering everything that is going on with the Supreme Court.
But we will see and continue to update the press.”
Some journalists may dispute this claim: Sanders has not held a press briefing at the White House since Sept. 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the shortage of briefings was not due to an aversion to television journalists “showing off,” though he said, “I don’t disagree with the fact that they’re showing off.”
He therefore suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press could be more frequent.
"The president holds more Q&A sessions than any president before him," he said, adding without citing evidence: "We checked the numbers."
The briefings will still be there, Sanders said, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, it’s much better than talking to me.
“Let’s try to do that, as in the last few weeks, and this will replace briefings with press briefings and you can talk to the president of the United States.”
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president has perhaps demonstrated the reason, giving a freewheeling, and at the same time bizarre, speech in front of a group of journalists.
Health minister writes to Scottish NHS European workers to voice concerns over Brexit
The Health Minister has written to EU staff working at Scotland’s NHS to express the country’s gratitude and wish them to stay after Brexit.
Scottish MP Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months in advance of the UK’s exit from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to meet the costs of settled status claims for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In his letter, Minister Freeman writes: “Throughout the summer there have been continuous negotiations between the UK and the EU on Brexit, which will lead to the autumn decisions.
But the British government has also been preparing for the possibility of a no-deal scenario.
I know this is a time of great concern for all of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate today my appreciation for the contribution made by all staff members, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and expertise that strengthens and improves the work of health services, benefiting patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is certainly your home and we very much want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery following a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers defenseman Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after sustaining a head injury in Saturday's game against the Vanderbilt Commodores in which the team lost 31-27, The Tennessean's Mike Organ reported.
Technical Manager Rod Reed told reporters that the accident that caused the injury happened just before the break.
"He came over to the sidelines and passed out," Reed said.
First responders and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen at the sidelines, before slinging him on the stretcher and taking him away for further investigation.
A Tennessee State executive told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie underwent surgery at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no word yet on the type and extent of the damage" and that Tennessee State is trying to understand when he was injured.
Abercrombie, a sophomore, is in his first season with the Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He had made a total of five tackles before leaving the game, which brought his season total to 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp duties for buying property in the UK and the additional cash flow will be used to help the homeless, according to Labour’s new plans.
The move will neutralise the success of Corbyn’s initiative to attract young voters.
The stamp duty increase will be applied to taxpayers who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury Department plans to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp duties for buying property in the UK and the additional cash flow will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s initiative to attract young voters with the promise of providing more affordable housing and higher incomes.
The stamp duty increase will be applied to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, and additional resources will be in support of the Government’s initiative to combat homelessness.
The surcharge, which adds to the current stamp duty, including the high levels introduced two years ago on second homes and buy-to-let properties, could amount to more than 3%.
The Treasury Department expects the move to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
An estimated 13% of new construction in London is purchased by non-UK residents, driving up prices and making it difficult for first-time home buyers to enter the real estate market.
Many of the country's wealthiest areas, especially in the capital, have become "ghost towns" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the state.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a tax cut to help younger people buy their first home.
He accused big construction firms of keeping property prices high by grabbing land without using it and encouraged Prime Minister May to forego quotas on affordable housing to fix Britain’s “real estate woes.”
Corbyn has announced a raft of proposals for housing market reform, including rent controls and the elimination of no-fault evictions.
It also wants to give the council greater powers over the construction of new real estate.
Prime Minister May said: “Last year I said that I would be committed to re-establishing the British dream, which is that life should be better for the new generations.
And that means restoring the real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it would not be fair if buying a home was equally easy for people who do not reside in the UK and for foreign companies, as it is for British resident workers.
For many people the dream of owning a home has become too distant and the dignity of the homeless remains a reality.
Jack Ross: "My highest aspiration is to lead Scotland"
Sunderland technical director Jack Ross says his "highest aspiration" is to become manager of Scotland sooner or later.
The 42-year-old Scot is drawn to the challenge of reviving the North East side which is currently third in League One, three points from the top.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after being at the helm of St. Mirren during last season’s Scottish Premiership.
“I wanted to play for my country as a footballer.
I was in Serie B and that's it," Ross told the BBC's Sportssound programme.
I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child and it’s something I’ll always remember.
However, this will only be possible if I succeed as a team manager.”
Ross's predecessors at the helm of Sunderland were Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager says he has no anxiety about following such big names on an equally big team, having previously rejected proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Success for me right now is measured by the ability to bring the team back to the Premier League.
“Considering the structure and facilities of the club, we can say that it undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League,” he said.
“It’s not an easy task, but I think I will only succeed if I can get the team back on track.”
Ross began his career as a manager three years ago, after a stint as an assistant coach at Dumbarton and 15 months as a replacement coach for the Hearts.
He then helped Alloa save themselves from relegation to the third tier and led St. Mirren from the brink of relegation to the Championship title the following season.
Ross says he feels much more comfortable now than during his football career with Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was probably a real turning point,” he recalls about the direction of Alloa.
“I really believed that the role of manager was meant for me, more than that of a player.
It seems strange because I worked well, earned a living and had some good results.
But playing can be hard.
There are many things you have to deal with on a weekly basis.
I still deal with them in terms of work stress and pressure but the management seems good.
I’ve always wanted to direct, and now I do, and I feel a lot calmer than I’ve ever felt in my life.”

According to a study, the right time for a pint is 17:30 on Saturday
The summer heat wave has brought more revenue to struggling English pubs and more concern to catering services.
The data shows that pubs and bars saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July, while restaurant receipts fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, from commercial consultancy CGA, put the data together and commented: “The persistence of the sun and England’s long stay at the World Cup meant that July followed a similar path to June, when pubs were above 2.8 per cent, while restaurants were hit hardest.
The 1.8 percent drop in catering in June worsened in July.
The pubs and bars in which the majority of people drink were the most solid, with a homogeneous increase higher than the drop in restaurants.
Even the pubs in which you eat have suffered the heat, although not excessively as the restaurateurs.
It seems like people just wanted to go out and have a drink.
In managed pubs and bars, beverage sales rose by 6.6 percent in the month, while food consumption fell by three percent.
Paul Newman, Recreation and Hospitality Analyst at RSM, said: “These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remains the main factor when it comes to selling in the retail market.
Unsurprisingly, restaurants continue to struggle, although a drop in annual sales of 4.8 percent will be particularly burdensome in addition to continued cost pressures.

One in five children have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11, have secret social media accounts they hide from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in “fake on Instagram” pages.
The news has reinforced the fear that sexual content will be posted.
20 percent of students said they had a “main” account to show their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11, create social media accounts that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth of “fake” accounts on Instagram, a reference to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has reinforced the fear that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of students said they manage a cleaned-up “main” account to show to parents, while keeping one private.
A mother who accidentally discovered her 13-year-old daughter’s secret website found a teenage girl who urged others to “rape me.”
The research, from the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of private schools, found that 40 per cent of 11-18 year olds have two profiles, and half of those admitted to having private accounts.
HMC Director Mike Buchanan said: “It’s alarming that so many teens are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle to be ‘Voice to Athletes’ on Scottish Athletics Board
Eilidh Doyle was elected as a non-executive member of the council of Scottish Athletics during the national general assembly of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most decorated athlete in athletics and President Ian Beattie described the appointment as a great opportunity for those running the sport to benefit from his extensive experience at an international level over the past decade.
“Eilidh enjoys a deep respect within the Scottish, British and world athletics community and we are confident that in Scotland athletics could benefit enormously from bringing her on board,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I look forward to acting as the voice of athletes and hope I can contribute and help drive the sport in Scotland.
The American, winner of the 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Games and four Olympic Gold Medals, and currently a BBC commentator, has found herself unable to walk following a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
According to the doctors, only time could tell if I would recover and to what extent.
It was a grueling job but I recovered completely, he learned to walk again and today I move with agility!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!”
A breast pump’s advertising compares mothers and cows and divides opinion online
A company producing a breast pump has shared opinion online with an advertisement comparing nursing mothers and cows being milked.
To mark the launch of what is being called the “world’s first silent and wearable breast pump,” consumer technology company Elvie launched an ad in the form of a playful music video to show the freedom to express themselves as mothers given by the new breast pump.
Four real mothers dance in a cow barn on a track that includes songs like, “Yes, I’m milking but I don’t have a thing” and “If I hadn’t noticed, these aren’t breasts but my boobs.”
The chorus continues: "Pull it out, pull it out, feed the children, pull it out, pull it out, milk my ladies."
However, the advertisement, posted on the company’s Facebook pages, has caused controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video elicited different reactions among viewers, many of whom claimed it highlighted the “horrors” of the dairy industry.
"An unfortunate decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they also have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are stolen from them a few days after birth,” someone wrote.
The breast pump Elvie is worn discreetly under a bra for moms
Someone else commented, “Understandably traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for moms who will continue to care for their babies?"
Someone else added, “It’s really a meaningless advertisement.”
Others defended it, and one woman even admitted to finding the song "funny."
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I'd like to have one.
When I used the breast pump, I felt just like a cow.
Advertising is a bit irreverent, but it doesn’t stray too far from reality.
This is a brilliant product," someone wrote.
Another person commented, “This is a fun ad for moms who use the breast pump (often at work or in the bathroom) and feel like “cows.”
Its purpose is not to praise or judge the dairy industry."
In the end the protagonists of the video show that they danced with the discreet breast pump tucked into the bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the idea that many women who use the breast pump feel like cows.
The Elvie breast pump is however completely silent, has no wires or tubes and can be tucked into a nursing bra giving women the freedom to move around, hold babies in their arms and even go outside while they are pumping.
Ana Balarin, Mother’s partner and ECD commented: “The Elvie breast pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
Comparing the women who use the breast pump to the cows we wanted to highlight all the challenges of this practice demonstrating in a fun and easily recognizable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new breast pump is able to ensure. "
This is not the first time the breast pump Elvie has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two showed up on designer Marta Jakubowski’s catwalk wearing this product.
Hundreds of migrant children have quietly moved to a tent city on the Texas border.
The number of migrant children has increased exponentially even though monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part because the Trump administration’s harsh rhetoric and policy stance have made it harder to foster these children.
Most of those who took them into their custody were typically illegal immigrants who now fear to jeopardize their ability to stay in the country by offering to do so.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential fosters and other adult members of their families would be fingerprinted and the data would be passed on to immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who had offered to take in foster children alone.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
“Nearly 80 percent of the people who offer to take in children or belong to the families of these people are in the country illegally and most of them are criminal aliens.
We are therefore continuing to hunt down these people," Albence said.
To try to prosecute the children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that some of them will have to appear in court within a month of arrest, rather than 60 days, which was the previous standard period, according to those who work at reception points.
Many will appear in video conference rather than in person, to plead their legal status case before an immigration judge.
Those deemed ineligible for help will be quickly expelled.
The longer children remain in foster care, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety and depression that cause violent fits of anger or escape attempts, according to shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Those who support this position say that the probability of this happening is even higher in a large structure like Tornillo’s where, precisely because of its size, it is easier for children’s signs of discomfort to be ignored.
They add that moving children to the tent city without giving them time to emotionally prepare or greet friends could compound the trauma many are already facing.
Syria urges US, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately
In his speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return to their homeland even though the war is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces are occupying Syrian soil illegally under the pretext of fighting terrorism and "will be treated accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately without any conditions," he said in front of the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where since 2011 there have been more than 360,000 deaths and millions of people have had to leave their homes.
He reiterated that Damascus will continue to “fight this holy war until it has liberated all Syrian territories” from terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, who mainly train and support Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said conditions were favourable for their return and accused "some Western countries" of "finding unfounded fears" that push refugees to stay away from their homeland.
“We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to intervene to facilitate their return,” he said.
“What should only be a humanitarian issue is being politicized.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that reconstruction aid will not be allocated to Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib, the rebels’ last major stronghold, has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented an extended attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement has "exact deadlines" and expressed the hope that the military action will target jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front, which "will be uprooted".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene a new committee of government and opposition members to draft a constitution for post-war Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem outlined the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the group's work should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" without any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
Based on this logic, Trump will be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers perhaps hope, his presidency should end prematurely due to an impeachment or scandal.
In what will undoubtedly be "the most dramatic presidential finale ever!"
At the moment, there are no signs of viewer decline.
Since 2014, first-night percentages have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News averages 2.4 million prime-time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” has surpassed network percentages to reach 3.5 million viewers on the most important news nights.
“It’s a fire that people are drawn to because it’s not something explainable,” says Neal Baer, showrunner of ABC’s “Designated Survivor,” which tells the story of a cabinet member who suddenly becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
In Scovell, a brilliant comedy writer and author of “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club,” she has another theory.
Remember a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election?
The driver told her she would vote for Trump.
She asked him why.
He said, "Because it makes me laugh."
Chaos is a source of fun.
Of course, unlike any other television program, the Washington storyline can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families will be able to reunite, and the health of the global economy.
Stopping following the news, however, is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it is far beyond the duty of informed citizens to find themselves following for the sixth hour in a row a group of experts who discuss Bob Woodward’s in-depth research for his book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich-skin jacket (“a garment full of thuggery,” The Washington Post commented), and the implications of the disgusting descriptions that Stormy Daniels has made of his work.
I can’t watch Super Mario without thinking about it.
“Part of the reason it feels like a reality show is that every night there’s something new,” says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of “Pawn Stars,” about the changing actors and daily plot developments of Trump’s show (as opposed to N.F.L. praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't miss an episode, otherwise you're left behind.
This week I went to visit Mike Fleiss on the north coast of Kauai and despite it being a sunny day with almost 30 degrees, he was locked in the house watching MSNBC and while he was recording CNN.
He failed to break away from TV, not while Brett Kavanaugh faced the Senate Judiciary Committee and the uncertain future of the Supreme Court.
Fleiss commented, "I remember when we used to do all those crazy programs and people would say, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization.'
“I thought it was a joke, but they were right.”

External money inflow in race for tighter midterm elections
It’s no surprise that the 17th district is experiencing an influx of money thanks to the realignment of a congressional district that has resulted in two sitting members now running for the same seat.
The recent redefinition of the suburban district of Pittsburg brings in Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district during a special election held last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania’s old 12th district that overlaps with the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January ruled that in the old districts the constituencies had been unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of Republicans.
The run to the 17th district sparked a campaign characterized by fierce opposition between the financial branches of the two largest parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a landslide victory in the March special election for the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
That seat had been held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political pundits have given Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States thought of penalizing El Salvador because it supports China, then they changed their minds
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
In June 2017, a rather cordial meeting took place between Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela and President Trump who also had a hotel in Panama until the partners forced the Trump Organization’s leadership group to leave.
State Department officials have decided to return the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama following the “recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan,” department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But the decision to impose sanctions was made only against El Salvador, which in 2017 received about $140 million in aid from the Americans for drug trafficking control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts to financial aid and restrictions on visas, would have been worrisome for the Central American country with a high percentage of unemployed and murders.
After a series of internal meetings, officials from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in trying to prevent migrants from making their way to the United States.
But in mid-September senior officials made it clear that they intended to continue with the conference, thus definitively waiving any sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence was tasked with chairing the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, to demonstrate the importance the administration attaches to this meeting, diplomats say.
And the three American envoys returned safely to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without receiving further messages of rebuke or punishment from Washington.
A Bolton spokesman at the White House declined to comment on details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials and two diplomats who agreed to speak on condition of anonymity about internal decisions.
What they said was confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration who wanted to remain anonymous.
Study the history
In the report that will be published, special prosecutor Robert Mueller could accuse Trump of obstruction of justice, a fact that now seems to exist sufficient evidence.
According to reports, Mueller’s investigation is intended to shed light on Trump’s possible collusion with Russia during the presidential campaign.
If Congress were to pass to the Democrats, Trump would have to answer these charges in front of voters and perhaps a jury of his peers just as he prepares for a new candidacy.
The unknowns are many and I do not mean to say that the fall of Trump is inevitable, as is not that of his counterparts in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic we will have to make choices that will determine how long the fight can last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler if the Western powers stopped him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
On that occasion we failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around these turning points where the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are facing different challenges at the moment.
What if Trump decides to fire Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein’s position has been complicated since the paper reported that he secretly suggested wiretapping Trump last year and questioned his ability to serve as president.
Rosenstein says the Times story is not true.
“How will we respond if the FBI’s new investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or impartial or if it is upheld in the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of attempted rape and false testimony?
And above all, in the midterm elections will we vote for a Congress that will ask Trump to answer for his actions?
If we do not pass these tests, democracy will have to prepare for a long winter.
But the lesson I learned in Prague makes me think that we will succeed.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, moved to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles with the swastika.
With such a legacy, I can only be optimistic about the future.”

Rangers' Graham Dorrans is optimistic about Rapid Vienna
On Thursday, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna knowing that a win over the Austrians, after a convincing draw against Villarreal in Spain, would give them excellent opportunities to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
Although midfielder Graham Dorrans played his first game of the season in the 2-2 draw with Villarreal due to a knee injury, he believes this result can allow the Rangers to do great things.
“For us it was a positive result because Villarreal is a good team,” said the 31-year-old.
“We faced the game convinced that we were doing well and we brought home a point.
Maybe we could have won in extremis but, all in all, the draw is a fair result.
They were better in the first half, while in the second we played better.
As for Thursday, it will be another great European evening.
We hope to win the three points but it will be a difficult match because our opponents have achieved a good result in the last game, but I am sure that, thanks to the support of the public, we will not disappoint.
Last year was definitely difficult because of my injuries and the changes at the club level but now the feelings are positive.
The team is in good shape, the guys are having fun and the preparation is going well.
So we can forget the problems of last season and think about the future."
Women are concerned about the costs of long-term care
Although those who participated in the survey have clear ideas about the type of assistance they would like to receive, few have addressed the topic in the family.
About half of Nationwide respondents say they have talked to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had discussed it with their children.
According to Holly Snyder, Vice President of Life Insurance at Nationwide, “People want a member of their family to take care of them, but they don’t face this conversation.”
Here's where to start.
Talk about it with your spouse and children: you cannot prepare your family to assist you if you do not communicate in time what you want.
If you have a counselor, decide with him or her and your family members where and how you want to receive assistance, because these factors can be cost-determining.
Involve a financial advisor: he can advise you on how to pay the expenses you will have to face.
Choosing a financing for long-term care may include a traditional insurance policy or a hybrid life policy with surrender value to cover these expenses or continue to pay money for insurance as long as you are able to do so.
Prepare all the necessary documents to avoid legal battles at your death.
Appoint a health care attorney so that a person you trust can oversee medical care and make sure the professionals meet your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Also consider the possibility of a proxy for your finances.
You can choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and make sure your accounts are paid if you are unable to do so.
Do not forget the details: imagine that your elderly parent is rushed to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write this information down in detail so that you are always ready.
“It’s not just a question of finances, but who are the doctors?” asks Martin.
"What are the medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
Be prepared for any eventuality.”
Man shot multiple times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle while walking home after spending the evening outside.
The victim, a 40-year-old man, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a “random action.”
The victim did not see his attacker.
He is not in any way in danger of death and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to official sources, at least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday. The death toll is set to rise.
Communications have been cut off and rescuers have been unable to get any information from the regency in Donggala, an area north of Palu that is close to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude quake.
After the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Here are some essential facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi island and with a population of about 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
When it was hit by the earthquake and tsunami, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala is a regency extending along more than 300 km (180 mi) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The regency, an administrative region dependent on a province, had about 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of livelihood for the economy of the Central Sulawesi province and especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also an important activity in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit several times by tsunamis in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
Another tsunami struck the western area of Donggala in 1996 killing nine people.
Indonesia lies in the seismic zone known as the Pacific Ring of Fire and is often hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the strongest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On December 26, a powerful earthquake on the west coast of Aceh province north of Sumatra caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, including more than half of Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra between late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that slammed into the southern coast killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
The victims were more than 1,100.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, triggering a 10-meter tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh causing destruction and panic in people who remembered the devastation of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
In this case there was no tsunami but more than 100 people died under the rubble.
2018: A strong earthquake struck the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia killing more than 500 people, most of them in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charge
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on assault charges.
According to a report issued Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers, Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, for obstructing the complaint and resisting arrest.
According to the report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, she tore her phone out of her hand.
Palin was transferred to the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and his bail was set at $500, according to KTUU.
According to the television network, he appeared in court on Saturday and declared himself "definitely innocent".
Palin faces three first-degree charges, including up to one year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a second-degree felony punishable by one day's detention and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with criminal acts.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
The mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is currently before Alaska’s Veteran’s Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, obstructing the reporting of the crime and possession of a weapon while drunk in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of punching her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 for linking her son’s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder following her time in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communications networks are not working and the death toll is set to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck off Central Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia’s capital Jakarta.
Videos circulating on social media show the moment of impact.
When the tsunami hit the coast, hundreds of people gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu.
Federal prosecutors seek extraordinary death penalty for NYC terror attack suspects
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the author of the terrorist attack that killed eight people: a rare sentence that has never been carried out for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is accused of using a Home Depot rental van to hit a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan by peddling pedestrians and cyclists in October.
Under the conditions for the death penalty in the southern district of New York, to justify the death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed the eight victims and just as “intentionally” inflicted serious bodily injury.
According to the court document, both of these charges can lead to the death sentence.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury charged Saipov with 22 counts that included eight counts of murder with criminal association, typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “genuine planning and premeditation,” prosecutors said, describing how Saipov carried it out as “atrocious, cruel and depraved.”
The preliminary notification states that "Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused damages, offenses and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco."
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
Ten years have passed since the Southern District of New York prosecuted its last capital punishment case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug traffickers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death sentence was last carried out in New York in 1953 for the federal case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a husband and wife accused of conspiracy through espionage and indicted for passing information to the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs both died in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no sign of repentance in the days and months following the attack.
Police say they are proud of what they have done in front of investigators.
According to the prosecution, Saipov told authorities that he decided to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked the police to hang the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
As for the 22 counts, he pleaded not guilty.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was “obviously disappointed” by the prosecution’s decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept a guilty plea and life without parole will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s group of defenders had previously pleaded with prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP Says Nigel Farage Must Lead Brexit Talks
Nigel Farage today vowed to “mobilize the people’s army” during a protest at the Tory conference.
When one of Theresa May’s party MPs suggested he should deal with negotiations with the European Union, the former leader of the UK Independence Party said politicians should “feel the pressure” from Eurosceptics.
In March, Conservative MP Peter Bone said in Birmingham that the UK “would already be out of Europe” if Farage were the Brexit Secretary.
But the challenges May faces in trying to reconcile the positions of her deeply divided party were highlighted by Tories in favour of staying in Europe who took part in a separate protest against Brexit in London.
The Prime Minister is trying to apply the Chequers Plan among the attacks of Brexit supporters, those who want to stay in Europe and the European Union.
The allies insist on continuing the attempt to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the strong collective reaction, and forcing the Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between what May proposes and "chaos".
At the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull, Bone said he wanted to leave the Chequers Plan.
He suggested that the task of conducting negotiations with Brussels should have been entrusted to Farage.
"By now we would be out of Europe," he said.
MP Wellingborough added: "I am for Brexit but we must abandon the Chequers Plan".
Explaining the reasons for his opposition to the European Union, he said: “We did not fight world wars to be servile.
We want to be able to enforce our laws in our country.”
Bone rejected views that public opinion would have changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their mind and want to stay in Europe is completely false.”
Tory MP Andrea Jenkyns, a supporter of Brexit, also attended the rally and told reporters: “I simply tell the prime minister to listen to the people.
The Chequers Plan is not appreciated by the public in general, the opposition will not vote for it and does not enjoy the favors of our party and our activists who go through the streets in search of votes to allow us to be elected.
Let go of the Chequers Plan and start listening."
In an incisive message to May, he added: “Prime Ministers can keep their place when they keep their promises.”
At the rally, Farage said politicians should be able to “feel the pressure” if they were going to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They are trying to betray Brexit and we are here today to tell them that we will not allow them to do that.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to put pressure on our political class that is on the verge of betraying Brexit.
“We intend to mobilise the people’s army of this country that voted for Brexit and we will not stop until we become an independent, self-reliant and proud UK.”
Meanwhile, those in favour of staying in Europe marched through the streets of Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small number of activists have pushed the Tories against the flags of Brexit after the formation of the group this weekend.
The Labour Party derided the Conservatives for the security problems they had with a party app at the opening of the conference.
“These are the people who say they can install the IT systems and all the technology for the Canada plus plus deal, for frictionless borders and for borderless trade in Ireland,” he added.
It's all a farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he concluded.
Warren is seriously considering running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the November election she will seriously consider running for president.
According to the Boston Globe, the Democratic senator from Massachusetts spoke about her future Saturday at a town hall in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump’s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
The hypothesis that he could challenge Trump in 2020 had been in the air for a long time.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters in the form of a city assembly since Trump took office.
One participant asked her if she would run for president.
Warren responded that it is time for “women to go to Washington to fix the government and that implies that a woman holds the highest office.”
Arrested for LSU Sims player murder
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on Saturday said they had arrested a suspect in the murder of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11:00 a.m. on ETNews.
On Friday, he released a video of the murder asking for help identifying a man visible in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday morning.
“Wayde Sims sustained a gunshot wound to the head that caused his death,” Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told 247Sports.
Wayde stepped in to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was at the crime scene holding a weapon and that he had hit Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and held in custody at the Parish Police Department in East Baton Rouge.
A nearly two-meter junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, last season Sims played 32 games, 10 of which started with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after victory over Sebastian Vettel thanks to team orders
When Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of teammate Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was immediately apparent that the Mercedes team’s orders would heavily affect the race.
From pole, Bottas started well leaving Hamilton to defend from Vettel's attacks in the first two laps.
Vettel stopped first at the pits, leaving Hamilton in the traffic of the group's tail, a move that could be decisive.
Hamilton overtook him after a few wheel-to-wheel actions in which the Ferrari driver tried to prevent the passage inside, risking to finish out after a double shift to defend himself in the third corner.
Max Verstappen starts from the last row of the grid but at the end of the first lap he is already seventh on the day of his 21st birthday.
He then drove the race for most of the race without stopping at the pits for the change of tires and tries to finish quickly to overcome Kimi Raikkonen by conquering the fourth place.
In the end, however, he must make the pit stop on lap 44 and in the remaining 8 laps he is not able to increase the pace and pass Raikkonen, who arrives fourth.
“It’s a difficult day because Valtteri worked very well all weekend and was really kind to let me pass.
The team did an outstanding job to take first and second place,” said Hamilton.
A Bad Example of Body Language
At a rally Saturday, President Donald Trump taunted Senator Dianne Feinstein for her insistence that she did not disclose the contents of Christine Blasey Ford’s letter accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of attempted rape.
During a rally in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly about Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are “mean, bad, and liars.”
“What can happen and what is happening in the last few days in the Senate where people are angry, petty, mean and lying,” he said.
“When there are obvious signs that the news is being spread and the people in charge are saying, ‘Oh no, it wasn’t me.
I could never do that."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you break the news?
Remember his answer... did you reveal the contents of the document? - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn't do it."
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
We revealed it... No, we didn’t,” she added, imitating the senator.
The letter in which Ford accuses Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July and the content was leaked in early September, but Feinstein denies that the indiscretion leaked from her office.
“I did not conceal Professor Ford’s allegations, but I did not reveal her story,” Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"He asked me to keep the information confidential and I did."
But his denial is not credible to the president, who during Saturday night's rally commented: "I'll tell you, this is just a bad example of body language.
“Maybe he didn’t, but this is the worst example of body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who has been charged with attempted sexual assault by three women, the president suggested Democrats are using these allegations for their own purposes.
"They are trying to regain power by any means necessary.
You see the pettiness, the meanness. They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to get over to take back power and control,” the president said, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars bounced back after Friday's Elite League loss to the Belfast Giants by winning the return game 5-3 on Saturday in Dundee.
The Giants went straight to a two-goal lead by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie led the home team to a draw before Dwyer put the Giants back in the lead.
Francois Bouchard scored for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen’s two goals sealed their victory.
It was the third defeat of the Elite League season for Adam Keefe's men who had come back on Friday night in Belfast and won the game with Dundee 2-1.
The two teams have already met four times this season and the Giants have won the first three games.
Dwyer scored the first goal in the 3:35 minute on assists by Kendall McFaull, while Beauvillier doubled after four minutes on assists by David Rutherford.
In what was a pretty lively first half, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt provided Cownie with a draw assist at 15:16.
Dwyer gave the Giants the lead by scoring the second goal of the night at the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard regained the draw after a strategic maneuver at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran contributed to Nielsen's action that put Dundee ahead for the first time in the match at the end of the second half and led to his team's victory by scoring the fifth goal midway through the last half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play their next home game at Milton Keynes on Friday.
Flight Controller Dies to Allow Hundreds of Passengers to Escape Earthquake
In Indonesia, a flight controller will be hailed as a hero after he died to allow a plane carrying hundreds of people to take off and save them.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing due to a powerful earthquake that struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to affect the area and many are trapped in rubble in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung remained in his place in the control tower of Palu’s Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport, which oscillated fearfully.
He wanted to make sure that Batik Air 6321, which was on the runway, could take off safely.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he thought it was going to collapse.
He died later at the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian broadcaster ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“This is very sad news for us,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, and the national disaster response agency says access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The death toll is set to rise because many bodies are still under the rubble and it has been impossible to reach many others," said Sutopo spokesman Purwo Nugroho.
Waves up to 6 meters high have devastated Palu, where a mass burial will be carried out on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are transporting aid and food.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance carries bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Minimarkets are being looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is doing everything possible to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find.
The situation is already tragic, but it could be much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country’s army men: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all activities related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?” according to CNN.
During the year Indonesia had already been hit by earthquakes in Lombok, where 550 people had died.
Air disaster in Micronesia: Air Niugini now claims there is one missing after lagoon accident
The airline of the flight that crashed in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, after claiming that all 47 people on board among passengers and crew members had managed to save themselves, now claims that there is a missing.
According to Air Niugini news, updated on Saturday afternoon, one passenger is missing from the call.
The airline confirmed that it is in contact with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details about the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats rescued the other passengers and crew after the crash while the plane was attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
According to official sources, seven people were taken to the hospital on Friday.
The airline says six passengers were admitted to hospital on Saturday and are all in stable condition.
What caused the accident and the exact sequence of events are still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy claim that the plane crashed into the lagoon because it did not reach the runway.
Some witnesses claim that the plane crossed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane arrived at a very low altitude.
“And it was really lucky,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes then explained that he and others, walking in the water that came to life, managed to reach the emergency exits of the plane.
He added that the flight attendants panicked and screamed and that he was slightly hit in the head.
According to the U.S. Navy, even some sailors who were working nearby to fix a pier provided rescue by using a dinghy to carry people to shore before the plane sank in about 100 feet (30 meters) of water.
Aviation Safety Network data indicates that in the past two decades 111 people have died in PNG-registered airline crashes but none of these involved Air Niugini.
Analyst reconstructs the night of the woman burned alive
The trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014 ended on Saturday.
Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used the cell phone data to reconstruct the movements of the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said she recovered location data from several cellphones showing that, contrary to what she said, Tellis was with Chambers the night she was killed.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers around the time he claims to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford appeared in court on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When asked by the prosecutor if Tellis was telling the truth that he was in Sanford’s truck that night, Sanford confirmed that he was “lying because my truck was in Nashville.”
Another inconsistency is the fact that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for two weeks when she died.
Cell phone data indicates they've only known each other for a week.
Rowlett explained that after Chambers’ death, Tellis deleted Chambers’ messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
“He erased her from his life,” Hale said.
The defense will begin its final argument on Sunday.
The judge expects the trial to pass to the jury later on the same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of the genre by inserting positive messages in their songs.
Bristol-based group The High Breed says hip-hop has moved away from its roots when it spread political messages and denounced social problems.
Instead, they want to go back to basics and do a conscious hip-hop kind of thing again.
Artists such as the Fugees and Common have recently returned to the UK thanks to characters such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
New York nanny sues couple for firing her with 'racist' lyrics
In New York, a nanny sued a couple for discriminating against her after she accidentally received a text in which her mother complained that she was “another black woman.”
The couple deny being racist by comparing the request to a real "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her disappointment when she discovered that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, who arrived for her first day of work in 2016, was black.
“NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO ANOTHER BLACK,” Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, after realizing the mistake, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman “embarrassed” fired Ms. Maurice saying she had been unhappy with their previous nanny, an African-American, and that she expected a Filipino.
He paid Miss Maurice for the day's work and sent her home in a taxi.
Maurice sued the couple and, for being fired, seeks compensation for the beauty of $350 a day for the six months of full-time work for which she was initially hired, albeit without a contract.
“I want them to understand that they can’t behave like this,” he told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple responded to the racism charge by stating that firing Maurice was the only thing to do as they feared they could not trust her after having offended her.
“My wife sent her a message saying something she didn’t mean.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist people,” her husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
"Would you entrust your children to a person with whom you have been rude, even if by mistake?
Your baby?
I don't think so."
Comparing the request to a real "extortion", Plasco said that his wife gave birth just two months ago and is in a "very difficult situation".
“You can’t be angry with a person like that.
It’s not very nice behavior,” the financial adviser added.
While the lawsuit is still ongoing, the court of public opinion immediately denounced the spouses on social media, harshly criticizing them for their behavior and for the logic followed.
A letter reveals that Paddington’s publisher feared readers would not appreciate a talking bear
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, born shortly after the book was accepted, comments on the letter: "It's not easy to put yourself in the shoes of someone who first read the book before it was published.
It’s funny now that we know how successful Paddington is.”
Claiming that his father, who worked as a cameraman at the BBC before writing the toy bear-inspired children's book, would not have reacted well to the rejection of his work, he adds that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was a bit "sad" after his death last year.
About Paddington, who she describes as “a very important member of our family,” she adds that her father was modestly proud of his success.
“He was a fairly quiet man, not a conceited person,” she says.
"But Paddington was so real to him that he behaved like when you have a child who reaches a goal: you're proud of it even if it's not your fault.
I think he interpreted Paddington’s success that way.
Although it was a creation of his imagination, he attributed the credit to Paddington himself.
I had to say goodbye on the phone to my daughter who was dying
Upon landing her daughter was rushed to the hospital in Nice Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“Nad called me several times to tell me that the situation was really serious and that our daughter would not make it,” says Ms. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then she called to tell me that she was going to die in a few minutes and that I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The effect of the medicines the doctors had given her to allow her heart to continue pumping was slowly fading.
She died a while before and that was the end.
I had to sit back and wait knowing this was happening.
I could not complain, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold back.”
In the end, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, saddened by the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers unaware of what was happening to her.
“Nobody knew,” he says.
“All the time I was just crying with my head down.
It’s hard to explain, but while I was on the plane I felt an incredible sense of solidarity with Nad.
I thought he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Tickets for two women in pain to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women whose loved ones have committed suicide work to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys attacked on a bridge in Wales tickets with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Davis’ son, Tyler, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and killed himself at 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I feel every day,” she says.
Davis, who is 45 and lives in Lydney, says her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said he lit up every room he walked into.”
But before he died he quit his job because depression had taken him “to a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s 11-year-old brother found him after he took his own life.
Davis says, "I'm still worried about a ripple effect."
He created the tickets "to let people know that there is someone they can turn to to talk to, even if it's a friend.
They don’t have to isolate themselves, they have to talk.”
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, not long after the death of his mother.
“You never said he felt down or depressed,” she says.
“A couple of days before Christmas we noticed that his attitude had changed.
Christmas Day hit rock bottom. When the children opened the gifts, he avoided looking them in the eye."
He says his death was a huge trauma that they had to work out: “He ripped the family apart.
He tore us to pieces.
But we had to go ahead and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's Future is Uncertain: FBI Begins Investigation
“I think if we could proceed as he asked, which is with a limited investigation in time and scope, we could reach an agreement,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the commission was “losing its coolness” because of the blocking of entrenched supporters.
Why doesn’t Kavanaugh and his Republican backers want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due to the choice of time.
There are only five weeks left in the midterm elections, on November 6, and if the Republicans as expected get a negative result, they will be greatly weakened in their attempt to get the man they chose elected to the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush called the senators lobbying to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and met with his wife Ashley, who was Bush’s personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI completes its report?
The Senate is currently made up of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh will get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break the delay and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's political refugee numbers 'decreasing' with Kim
A South Korean lawmaker says the number of North Koreans seeking political refuge from South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea’s unification ministry, says refugees were 1,127 last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park explains that the main reasons are tighter control of the border between North Korea and China and the higher tariffs demanded by those who smuggle these people out.
Pyongyang has not made any public statements.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape through China, whose border with North Korea is longer and easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers them illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often repatriates them by force.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
The two countries have already met in Pyongyang this month to discuss the stalled denuclearisation negotiations.
This follows the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, in which they agreed in general terms to collaborate to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho criticized U.S. sanctions for the lack of developments since then.
“Without trust in the United States, we cannot be certain of our national security and in such circumstances there is no chance that we will proceed to unilateral disarmament first,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi Calls Brett Kavanaugh “Hysterical” and Says He’s Not Fit for Supreme Court
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi calls Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and says he is not character-driven to fill that position.
Pelosi voiced this opinion Saturday in an interview during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I think if a woman had behaved in the same way, they would have called her hysterical,” Pelosi said of Kavanaugh’s statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has denied allegations that he sexually harassed Professor Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
At the beginning of his speech, Kavanaugh was so emotional that he almost screamed and his throat choked with tears as he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned committee Democrats who called the allegations against him an “absurd and coordinated smear campaign” organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi believes Kavanaugh’s testimony proves that he cannot enter the Supreme Court because he has proven to be biased against Democrats.
“I think he’s been self-excluded with his statements and the way he’s talked about the Clintons and the Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi then raised an objection when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he was confirmed and if Democrats would win a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I think if he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, not only is he not fit for the Supreme Court, but he’s not fit for the court that he’s presiding over right now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaugh’s potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe vs. Wade, because he is considered a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh sidestepped questions about his intentions to overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
Pelosi said, “You can’t send a hysterical, partisan person to the Supreme Court and demand that this decision be accepted in a positive way.”
And women have to use it.
It’s a righteous diatribe, months and years of fits of rage from which he can’t get out without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's weird, do you?"
And he continued, "It helped me a lot a woman who was an executive somewhere. She told me that she also cried when she got angry, but she had developed a technique where when she got angry and started crying she would say to the person she was talking to, 'You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And so it went on.
I thought yours was a brilliant idea.”
Tears are tolerated as an outpouring of anger in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of the clearest memories I have of a previous job in a predominantly male office goes back to when I once started crying over a fit of rage. An older woman, a glacial manager from whom I had always been slightly terrified took me by the throat and dragged me down the stairs.
“Don’t ever let me see you cry,” he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you’re sad and they’re happy because they’re holding you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic member of Congress from Colorado, collaborated with Gary Hart in his presidential race.
In 1987, when Hart's extramarital affair was discovered on a boat called Monkey Business and she had to give up the race, the disappointed Schroeder thought there was no reason why she should not try to run for president herself.
“It wasn’t really a well-considered decision,” he told me laughing about 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the running and we definitely didn’t need another one.
Some called them "Whitebeards and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since the campaign was already at an advanced stage, Schroeder was late with fundraising and swore she wouldn’t run if she didn’t raise $2 million.
It was a lost cause in the first place.
She found that some of the supporters who had given the candidates $1,000 would only give her $250.
"Do they think I can get a discount?" he asked.
When she gave the speech to announce that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed with emotions (gratitude for the people who had supported her, disappointment at the system that made it harder to find money and voters than representatives, and anger at the sexual discrimination she was a victim of), that she was moved.
“It looked like I was in the middle of a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalled, thinking about the reaction from the press.
“Someone might have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they would have written on my headstone.
“Maybe you’re crying a lot.”
How the U.S.-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The opening blows of the U.S.-China trade war have been thunderous, and while the battle is far from over, experts say a clash between the two countries could be beneficial to Beijing in the long run.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, has already issued the first warning this year by taxing major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with new duties on more than $200 billion ($175 billion) worth of goods. This means that taxes will be levied on half of goods of Chinese origin.
Beijing has reacted each time with measures of the same type by recently applying duties of five to ten percent on 60 billion dollars of American goods.
China has promised to respond to the U.S. blow by blow, and the world’s second-largest economic power is unlikely to back down anytime soon.
For Washington to give up, one would have to give in to its demands, but publicly bowing to the US would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Experts believe, however, that if Beijing plays its cards right, the pressures of the trade war with the US can positively affect China in the long run by diminishing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a swift policy decision by Washington or Beijing could create the initial conditions for an economic collapse in both countries is in fact much more dangerous than has been recognized so far,” said Abigail Grace, a researcher studying Asia at the Center for New American Security.
Syria 'ready' to return refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild the country ravaged by more than seven years of war.
In front of the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the country's conditions are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to recover the areas destroyed by the terrorists to restore normalcy.
Now there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country who had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
According to UN estimates, more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in Syria are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would gladly accept assistance to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that he will not accept any aid conditional on or by those countries that supported the insurgency.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europa won the 2018 Ryder Cup beating Team USA with a final score of 17.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has thus lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the trophy when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
USA champion Phil Mickelson, who fought for the majority of the tournament, threw his tee shot into the water at the 16th hole of the par 3 awarding victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer has stood out in all his rounds by becoming one of only four players ever to record a 5-0-0 since the current-formula tournament was first played in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated with the score of 5&4 by the bottom Danish player in the ranking Thorbjorn Olesen of the European team.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, has surrendered for 2&1 to the Englishman Ian Poulter who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran of the Ryder Cup, Spain’s Sergio Garcia, who played eight times, became the European player who won the most in the tournament’s history with 25.5 points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help it.
It's been a rough year.
I am grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am very happy to have won the cup again.
It’s a victory for the team and I’m happy to have made my contribution,” said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the baton to his compatriot John Ram who beat USA golf legend Tiger Woods with a 2&1 score in Sunday’s singles.
“If I think I grew up watching his matches, I’m really very proud to have beaten Tiger Woods,” Rahm said.
Woods has lost all four of his matches in France and now the tally of his Ryder Cup matches amounts to 13 wins, 21 losses and 3 draws.
A strange statistic if you think that he is one of the greatest players of all time having won 14 of the main titles, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The USA team has been trying to find fairways all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have played top-level golf throughout the tournament.
USA captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance from his team: "I'm proud of these guys because they fought.
At some point this morning we put pressure on the Europa team.
We threw away this opportunity.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players performed very well.
I'm going to work with the American PGA and the Ryder Cup committee, and we're going to move on.
I’m fond of these 12 guys and I’m proud to be their captain.
We've done everything we can.
They played better than us.”
Red Tide Update: Concentration Declines in Pinellas, Manatee, and Sarasota
The Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission’s latest report shows an overall decrease in red tide concentration in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, patchy flowering conditions, which suggest a decrease in concentration, are evident in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties.
The red tide bloom stretches for about 130 miles of coastline from northern Pinellas County to southern Lee County.
The patches are about 10 miles off Hillsborough County but in fewer areas than last week.
The red tide was also observed in Pasco County.
Last week an average concentration was reported in Pinellas County or off its coast, a low to high concentration off Hillsborough County, a background concentration to a high concentration in Manatee County, a background concentration to a high concentration in Sarasota County or off its coast, a background concentration to a high concentration in Lee County, or a background concentration to a concentration off its coast.
Cases of respiratory irritation continue to be reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
There have been no reported cases in northwestern Florida in the past week.
