Members of the Welsh Assembly concerned about being ‘identified as Muppets’
Several members of the assembly expressed their dismay at the proposal to change its title by MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This controversy has arisen from the plan to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly from all the different political parties have expressed concern that this measure could become a source of mockery.
A member of the Labour Party assembly said his party was concerned that the MWP was "remaining with Twp or Pwp".
For non-Welsh readers: In Welsh, twp means stupid and, pwp, excrement.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party assembly has commented that the whole of his party "doesn't see it with good eyes" and has proposed several alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative member said his group was "open" to the name change, but said there was too little difference between the term "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context, it must be said that the letter "w" in Welsh is pronounced similarly to the letter "u" in Yorkshire English.
According to the committee of the assembly in charge of drawing up the legal draft to introduce the name changes: "The final decision on any qualifier for appointing the members of the assembly will of course fall on the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gives the Assembly of Wales full power to change its name.
In June, the committee published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, with broad support for the proposal to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
As for the title of the members of the assembly, although the committee opted for "Members of the Welsh Parliament" or "WPM", the option of "MWP" is the one that received the widest support in the public consultation.
Apparently, the members of the assembly are suggesting different alternatives. However, the attempt to reach a consensus can be a headache for the president of the assembly, Elin Jones, who is expected to present the legal draft on the changes in a matter of weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes related to the functioning of the assembly, such as rules on disqualification of its members and the design of the committee system.
The members of the assembly will hold the final vote on their denomination during the debate related to the legislation.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum to change the name of their country
Citizens will choose on Sunday whether or not they want to change the name of their country to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular consultation was decided in an attempt to resolve a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, which already has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents a way of reclaiming its territory and has repeatedly opposed the country’s attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, opposed to the plebiscite on the name change, has said he will ignore the vote.
However, those in favour, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, are of the opinion that the name change is simply the price that must be paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's stop ringing: the difficulties of the churches of Harlem
“Historically, the older people I’ve talked to say there was a bar and a church on every corner,” says Mr. Adams.
“Today, there is none left, of the two.”
According to Adams, the disappearance of the bars can be understood.
“People have a different way of socializing today,” he says.
“The bars have already ceased to be the kind of living rooms for the neighborhood where people used to go periodically.”
With regard to the churches, he worries that the money obtained from the sale of assets will not last as long as their leaders foresee "and that sooner or later they will return to the place from which they came".
The churches, he adds, could end up being replaced by apartment buildings and condominiums with the kind of people who will not be of any help to the temples that remain in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white," he says, "and therefore what they will do will be to accelerate the closure of all churches, since it is quite unlikely that most people who move to these condominiums will end up being members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis; the church of Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's ten years later.
The original white Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
A nearby black congregation acquired ownership of the building.
St. Martin's passed into the hands of a black congregation led by the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retail merchants on 125th Street, one of Harlem's main shopping streets, who resisted hiring or promoting black people.
In 1939, a fire caused serious damage to the building, and when Reverend Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild it, it was then that they commissioned the carillon.
The Rev. David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's Church, proudly described the rambler as "the bells of the poor people".
The expert who played the carillon in July described it differently: "A cultural treasure" and an "irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also observed that it was the first carillon in the world that was played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who had to move to the biggest carillon of the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has struck St. Martin's in recent months, by contrast, have been the complicated stories of architects and contractors, some of them brought by lay leaders of the church and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The council, the parish's governing body of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese last July expressing concern that the diocese "intended to pass on the costs" to the council, although the latter was not involved in the hiring of architects and contractors that the diocese sent.
Some parishioners have complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark Injures 13-Year-Old Boy While Searching for Lobsters in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving for lobsters in California on the first day of the lobster season, authorities said.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hammel explained to KSWB-TV in San Diego, he had been diving for half an hour with some friends on Saturday morning when he heard the screams of a boy asking for help. Then they rowed with a group to the place where the boy was to help him get out of the water.
Hammel says he first thought it was about the joy of having caught a lobster, but then he "realized I was screaming 'I've been bitten!
I've been bitten!'
He had his whole collarbone torn out," Hammel observed as he reached the boy.
"To get everyone out of the water, I shouted, 'There's a shark in the water!'" Hammel adds.
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted in serious condition.
It is not known which species of shark was responsible for the attack.
At a news conference, lifeguard Larry Giles said he was working a few weeks after a shark was detected in the area, but that it was decided that the species was not dangerous.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper torso area.
The authorities closed for 48 hours access to the beaches from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas due to the investigation and for security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but that most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans for the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's has decided to compete at Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with aisles of beauty products in the style of department stores occupied with specialized employees.
These great corridors are just part of a considerable investment in the UK beauty market, a market that moves around <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and that continues to grow as the fashion and home product sectors lag behind, and will be tested at 11 stores across the country to expand to more stores next year if the test is held.
The investment in beauty products is a product of the greed of supermarkets to take advantage of the space on their shelves that was previously intended for televisions, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury’s says it will double its beauty offering to offer up to 3,000 different products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees ranges will also take up more space with branded areas similar to those found in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket company is also in the process of relaunching its range of Boutique makeup products so that most of the products are now suitable for vegans, an aspect increasingly requested by younger consumers.
The retail chain The Fragrance Shop, in addition, will open concessions to two stores of Sainsbury's. The first did last week in Croydon, south of London, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Internet shopping and the shift towards a habit of buying food in smaller quantities every day in small supermarkets has meant that large supermarkets have to find other ways to convince people to come.
According to Mike Coupe, executive director of Sainsbury’s, the stores will increasingly resemble department stores in an attempt by the supermarket chain to fight Aldi and Lidl discount supermarkets with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has been introducing Argos outlets in many of its supermarkets, as well as a number of Habitat stores since it acquired both chains two years ago, which, he says, has served to relaunch grocery sales and increase the profitability of acquisitions.
The supermarket chain’s previous attempt to relaunch its beauty products and pharmacy departments resulted in a failure.
Sainsbury's did a joint operation test with Boots in the early 2000s, but it all came to a head when they didn't agree on how to divide the profits of the chain of pharmacies into supermarkets.
This new strategy comes after the sale three years ago by Sainsbury's of its business of 281 pharmacies to Celesio, owner of the chain LloydsPharmacy, for 125 million GBP.
According to Sainsbury’s, Lloyds will play an important role in the global plan, as it will expand the range of luxury skincare brands, such as La Roche-Posay or Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Chief Commercial Officer of Sainsbury’s, said: “We have transformed the look of our beauty product aisles to improve the environment for our customers.
We have invested in specifically trained workers who will be of great help when offering advice.
Our range of brands is designed to fit any need; on the other hand, the attractive environment and practical location make us now one of the preferred destinations for beauty products and challenge the traditional way of shopping.”
Peter Jones 'furious' after Holly Willoughby backs <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
The Dragons' Den star Peter Jones left "furious" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby walked away from a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with Jones' lifestyle brand business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby does not have time to devote to the business set of household products and accessories Truly.
The business of these two media characters had come to be compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning host used Instagram to announce her departure.
Holly Willoughby has left the Dragons' Den star Peter Jones enraged as she retired at the last minute from the lucrative lifestyle branding joint business to focus on her own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV, which will also bring her great profits.
According to several sources, Jones was "furious" when the blonde TV star admitted, during a tense meeting held on Tuesday at the headquarters of his empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that the new agreements of the presenter, worth 1.5 million GBP, implied that he would no longer have enough time to devote to the joint brand of home products and accessories Truly.
The business had come to be compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and aspired to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to announce his departure from Truly, Jones took a private plane heading to one of his holiday residences outside the UK.
According to one source: "Truly was by far Holly's top priority.
It was meant to be her long-term future and where we would see her for the next twenty or thirty years.
His decision to back down left all parties involved speechless.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, we were so close to the launch...
Right now there is a warehouse full of goods at the Marlow headquarters ready to be sold.”
According to experts, the departure of the presenter of This Morning, one of the most profitable stars in the United Kingdom, could cost the company millions due to the significant investment that had been made in products, from pillows and candles to clothes and clothing for the home, and the possibility of delays for its launch.
It could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin had had an intimate relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as president last March.
Both couples spend their vacations together. In addition, Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will be the next brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones commented last night that "We won't be commenting on his business."
Tough accusations... "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the possible criticism he would receive from the media for making a comment that some would consider "little proper of a president" and for having such a positive opinion of the North Korean leader.
Why did Trump give up so much?
Trump claimed, mocking the tone of a news anchor’s voice:
“I haven’t given up anything.”
He noted that Kim was interested in holding a second meeting after the first held in Singapore in June was declared as a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations towards denuclearisation are stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, senior North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the leaders of the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a "corresponding response" from the United States to the country's early disarmament initiatives.
However, he noted, the U.S. continues to apply sanctions with the aim of keeping up the pressure.
Trump’s view, on the other hand, was much more optimistic in his speech.
“We’re doing very well with North Korea,” he said.
“We were going to declare war on North Korea.
Millions of people would have lost their lives.
And now we have this great relationship.”
According to Trump, his efforts to improve relations with Kim have had positive results: end of missile tests, help to free hostages and return home from the remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his unusual approach by talking about relations with Kim.
“It’s very easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this crowded compound, we would have about 200,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
An island destroyed and hundreds of deaths due to a tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, non-governmental organizations from other countries were told that they were not necessary.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population had to be displaced, no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they are not asking for international assistance, so the situation is quite demanding,” says Ms. Sumbung.
While Save the Children is organizing a team to go to Palu, it is not yet certain that foreign people can work on the ground.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see whether or not international agencies were allowed to contribute when offering aid.
Given the constant earthquakes that Indonesia suffers, the country remains unfortunately unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Although shelters have been built in Aceh in the event of a tsunami, they are not common on other coasts.
The apparent lack of warning sirens in Palu in the event of a tsunami, although there was a warning in place, is very likely to have contributed to the death toll.
Moving between Indonesia’s huge number of islands is, at best, quite a challenge.
And natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship that was docked in Lombok to care for earthquake victims is now heading to Palu; however, it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo had as a central element of his election campaign the improvement of Indonesia's battered infrastructure, and has invested huge amounts of money in roads and railways.
However, Joko's government faces re-election next year fraught with funding shortfalls.
Joko also faces pressure from the country's ongoing sectarian tensions, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative faith.
More than 1,000 dead and tens of thousands displaced are the result of street fighting between Christian and Muslim gangs with machetes, bows and arrows, and other bloodthirsty weapons.
Note: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge makes the tie-breaking goal with a distant kick against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea with his 89th-minute goal on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 metres from Chelsea's goal as his team was losing 1–0.
He settled the ball to the left before releasing an incredible shot aimed at the second post.
The shot crossed the entire area with a great elevation as it propelled toward the right crossbar of the goal.
The ball finally started the descent over a Kepa Arrizabalaga in the middle of the jump to try to stop it and ended up at the bottom of the net.
“I was just trying to get to that position to be able to shoot, and players like Shaqiri always play it forward as much as possible, so I tried to create myself as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw that Kante was coming, I made a touch and I didn't think much about it, I just dedicated myself to kicking."
Chelsea won 1–0 at half-time after scoring a goal in the 25th minute via Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In the play, the forward of the Blue team returned to heel a pass to Mateo Kovacic before starting from almost midfield and sprinting towards the field of Liverpool.
Kovacic made a quick combination from the midfield.
He then made a magnificent pass in depth, which left Hazard inside the area with the ball controlled.
Hazard overcame the defence to finish off the second post with a left leg kick that Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker could not reach.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage next Wednesday at 3pm at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3pm in London.
Death toll from Indonesia tsunami rises to 832
The number of deaths as a result of the earthquake and tsunami has increased to 832, according to data from the country's disaster agency reported on Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped among the rubble of collapsed buildings due to the 7.5-magnitude earthquake that struck on Friday and caused waves of up to 6 meters, according to Sutopo Purwo Nugroho agency spokesman at a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was completely covered by the rubble of the destroyed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after finding woman stabbed
The murder investigation began after the woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with multiple stab wounds in Grayson Mews, John Street; then a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have asked residents of the area to see or hear something in relation to the crime to appear before the authorities.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “While the investigation is still in its preliminary stages, I would like to appeal to anyone near John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious, please contact us.
I would also like to appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers who have been able to capture anything via the car’s on-board camera, to get in touch as they could have vital information for the investigation.”
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body was found is from Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman have arrived at the crime scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
As the investigation continues, police say they are reporting the incident to family members closest to the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to return to his apartment, but police have told him that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
When he found out what had happened, he was speechless.
Residents are being warned that they will spend hours until they can re-enter.
She could feel like a police officer explaining to a man that the whole area is being treated like the scene of the crime.
A woman appeared at the scene crying.
He keeps saying, “It’s terrible!”
At 14:00, two police vans were inside the cordoned off area with another van parked outside.
A number of Romani agents within the cordoned off area controlling the block of flats.
Anyone who may have information is asked to send a message directly to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously by calling 0800 555 111 and mentioning file 247 of September 30.
Cromwell's statue of the British parliament becomes the last monument affected by the discussion around "rewriting history"
His disappearance would be a kind of poetic justice for the destruction in the purest Taliban style of so many cultural and religious objects of England perpetrated by his fanatic Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society has described Crick's proposal as "madness" and an "attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, comments: "In the current debate around the removal of statues, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Palace of Westminster would become one of the main targets.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps he would end up sacrificing the incorrect Cromwell for the actions of his ancestor who did during the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent depiction of Cromwell is evidence of 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure still believed by many to be worthy of commemoration.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than now, as an advocate of parliament in the face of external pressure, in his case obviously from the monarchy.
Whether or not this constitutes a fully accurate representation remains a matter of historical debate.
What is true is that the conflict of the mid-seventeenth century shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure representing a side of this division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of being celebrated and commemorated."
Murdered Pig Kills Chinese Farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, local sources report.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan", was found dead with a severed artery and covered in blood near a pig yard in Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer was preparing to inject vaccines into pigs at a court in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
As far as we know, he had traveled Wednesday with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door leading to an adjoining pig yard.
According to him, there was a large male pig in the yard with blood in its mouth.
The forensic examination confirmed that the 250-kg pig had fatally wounded the farmer, according to the report.
“My cousin had his legs shattered and full of blood,” said the cousin, surnamed “Wu,” according to the evening news from Guiyang.
Scenes recorded by the security camera show Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not owned by Yuan or his cousin.
One of the market officials told the evening's news that the pig remained locked up and isolated in order to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while police gathered evidence at the crime scene.
Yuan's family and market officials are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Despite being very rare, there have been cases of pigs attacking humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their Massachusetts farm, and left the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing almost 300 kg grabbed a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife was able to scare the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was devoured by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC news that pigs are normally not aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as a "trigger".
“They like to play.
They are like children, they are very curious... they do not go with the idea of hurting.
You just have to give them the respect they deserve,” he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring torrential rains throughout the southwest of the United States.
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it advances over the colder waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S. over the next few days.
Rosa had winds of 138 km/h, typical of a Category 1 hurricane, at 5:00 a.m. on Sunday morning, eastern U.S. time, and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression is beginning to form in the Pacific Ocean, which is moving eastward toward the west coast of the U.S. When the Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to leave strong tropical moisture northward toward the southwest of the U.S.
The Rosa will leave up to 250 mm of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Tropical moisture will then interact with the approaching depression to generate widespread torrential rains throughout the southwest over the next few days.
At various points, 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous floods, waste flows and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
The strong tropical humidity will cause precipitation rates close to 50 to 75 mm per hour at various points, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
50 to 100 mm of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially in much of Arizona.
There is a possibility of flooding, since the situation is getting worse very quickly due to the dispersed nature of the tropical rains.
It is totally discouraged to enter the desert on foot in the face of the threat of tropical rain.
Torrential rains could cause the gorges to become runaway rivers. In addition, storms can bring wind gusts and dust clouds to specific points.
The coming depression will bring torrential rains at certain points off the coast of southern California.
It is possible that total precipitation above 50 mm is recorded, which could cause minor waste flows and slippery paths.
This would be the first rainfall of the rainy season in the region.
Isolated tropical rain showers will begin to arrive in Arizona between Sunday night and Monday morning, before the rain becomes more widespread between Monday night and Tuesday.
The torrential rains will spread to the Four Corners region on Tuesday and will persist throughout Wednesday.
October will see several major temperature swings across the U.S. as the Arctic cools, though the tropics will remain quite warm.
This phenomenon can sometimes cause drastic changes in temperature in a short distance.
The central region of the U.S. on Sunday is a clear example of drastic temperature differences.
Temperature differences of nearly 20 degrees have been recorded between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the lingering summer heat will try to expand again.
The month of October is expected to begin with heat in much of the central and eastern U.S., with temperatures around 27 degrees from the southern Plains area to parts of the northeast.
New York City could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
According to the long-term weather forecast, there is a good chance that temperatures will be above average in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million viewers watched Brett Kavanaugh’s statement
More than 20 million viewers saw on Thursday the gripping testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual abuse, which allegedly took place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford. The testimony was broadcast on six different television networks.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continued, with broadcasters disrupting Friday’s usual schedule due to a turn of events at the last minute: an agreement designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct an investigation of the charges for a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely convinced that Kavanaugh touched her drunk and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an exalted testimony, stated that he was absolutely convinced that this never happened.
According to Nielsen, it is likely that more than 20.4 million viewers saw this testimony on Friday.
The company had an average viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
Audience figures were not immediately available on other networks that broadcast the testimony, such as PBS, C-SPAN, or Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen often has trouble calculating the number of people who see him from his office.
Put in perspective, it is an audience similar to that of a playoff game of American football or that of the Oscars ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion leaders have clearly supported Kavanaugh’s appointment, was the network with the most viewers, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the whole day’s testimony, according to Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS made $3.1 million, NBC $2.94 million, MSNBC $2.89 million and CNN $2.52 million, according to Nielsen data.
The interest remains high after the testimony.
Flake was the central figure in Friday’s drama.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement saying they would vote for Kavanaugh, Flake was caught on CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning as he was censured by protesters as he attempted to climb into an elevator to go to a hearing of the Judiciary Affairs Committee.
Flake spent several minutes staring blankly as he was being televised live on CNN.
"Here I am, in front of you," one woman said.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
They said, ‘You have power, while there are so many women who don’t!’
Flake said his office had issued a statement and, before the elevator doors closed, said he would have more to say in the committee's view.
Within hours, all cable and broadcast networks were live-streaming the moment when the Judiciary Committee had to vote on whether or not to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate for a vote.
Flake said, however, that he would only do so on the understanding that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the nominee for next week, a condition demanded by the minority of Democrats.
Flake was persuaded in part by the conversations he had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a subsequent conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was influential, as it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to support Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of ‘playing politics’ over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticised her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with the future of the United Kingdom and of disregarding the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Congress in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview, in addition to the interview with May on the front page of the newspaper, May's former foreign minister Boris Johnson reinforced his attack on the so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, where he claims that the proposal that the United Kingdom and the EU collect taxes from each other is "absurd".
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson for the death of the LSU team player
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player who played for the LSU team.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and sent to prison on charges of second-degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson. According to police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses at the crime scene and say they found Simpson's DNA on them, CBS affiliate WAFB reports.
After questioning Simpson, he admitted to shooting Wayde dead, according to police.
His bail has been set at $350,000, according to the lawyer.
The East Baton Rouge district coroner's office released a preliminary report Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head toward the neck.
The department thanks the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police, and local citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to this arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva expressed his gratitude to the area’s law enforcement for their “diligence and for pursuing justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
At 1.98 m, he played winger and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also a basketball player on the LSU team.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds to start last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade commented that the team is "destroyed" and Wayde's death was "a very strong blow".
“Things like this are what make you suffer all the time,” Wade said.
A volcano spits ash in Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern suburbs of Mexico City.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity was detected at the crater and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded over a 24-hour period.

The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists shortly before the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police and thousands joined anti-riot rallies to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's vote on secession.
A group of pro-independence individuals held by riot police began throwing eggs and paint powder, which led to the appearance of dark clouds of dust in the streets normally overrun by tourists.
Later that day, clashes occurred with the police, who used their batons to contain the violent protesters.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted "Don't forget, don't forgive" face-to-face with unionist protesters shouting "Long live Spain."
Fourteen people had to be treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests, according to local sources.
Tensions have not abated in this independence-minded region a year after a referendum was held on October 1 that was considered illegal by Madrid but also carried out by Catalan separatists.
Voters elected independence by a very large majority, although the turnout was low, since the opponents of secession mostly boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting by entering polling stations across the region, sparking violent clashes.
The pro-independence groups camped all night on Friday to avoid a rally in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place anyway, but the demonstrators were forced to take another route.
Narc<0xC3><0xAD>s Termes, a 68-year-old electrician and one of the participants in the independence demonstration along with his wife, said he no longer had much hope about the chances of Catalonia achieving independence.
“Last year we had one of the best days.
I watched my parents cry for the joy of being able to vote, but now we’re stuck.”
Despite achieving a vital victory, albeit by a small margin, in the regional elections last December, the Catalan independence parties have suffered to maintain the momentum this year, since many of their main leaders are in self-imposed exile or detained waiting to be judged for their role in the organization of the referendum and the subsequent declaration.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, records the demonstration of support for the police with his phone, and says that the conflict has been revived by politicians on both sides.
“The tension is only increasing,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders jailed before the trial since late last year, announced that he would participate in the European Parliament elections next year.
“To stand as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to denounce the setback in democratic values and the repression we have seen on the part of the Spanish government,” he says.
Londonderry: Men arrested after running over a house with a car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after a car repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19:30 local time.
Inspector Bob Blemmings says damage was done to the doors and the building itself.
It is also possible that at some point someone fired a crossbow at the car.
A move by Menga gives Livingston the victory by 1 to 0 against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston was a win.
Livingston, who had risen in the league this year, surprised Glasgow Rangers in what is just Steven Gerrard's second loss in 18 games as Ibrox club coach.
Dolly Menga's play made the difference, as, with this win, Gary Holt's team climb to second position, which they share with the Hibernian.
Gerrard's, on the other hand, are still not winning away from home in the Premiership this season. Next Sunday they will face the leader, the Hearts, with whom they are separated by a difference of eight points.
But before that, the Rangers receive this Thursday the Rapid of Vienna in the Europa League.
Livingston, meanwhile, have extended their undefeated streak in the league to six games, with Holt as coach still not knowing what defeat is since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
The Livingston does not take advantage of its opportunities in front of the direct play of the visitors
Holt's team should have been ahead of the scorer long before the goal, as his direct play caused all sorts of problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson made his way between the defence, but wasted his chance when he found himself in front of the goal. Afterward, Alan Lithgow sent the ball off in a stretch to try to finish off Craig Halkett's header pass, which crossed the goal.
The locals were already fine with letting the Rangers get close to their area, as they knew they could get visitors into trouble on isolated plays.
And that’s how this decisive goal came about.
The referee whistled a foul against the Rangers' interests and Livingston made an opening to the band, where Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined so that Menga could touch it first and finish from the central part of the area.
By that time, the Rangers had dominated possession, but found themselves with an impenetrable defense and goalkeeper Liam Kelly who had very little work throughout the game.
The scenario was repeated in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a merit stoppage.
Rangers goaltender Allan McGregor stopped Scott Pittman on one occasion, and Lithgow deflected another combination play from Livingston.
The Rangers went on a one-on-one run in the Livingston area, only to be turned down. In addition, two penalties were claimed, one for Halkett's alleged entry to substitute Glenn Middleton, and one for hands. Both were dismissed.
Livingston "phenomenal": analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and great result for Livingston.
One man thinks they were excellent, and they continue to exceed all expectations on this upward trajectory.
His playing style and staff have hardly changed since his return to the top flight, although much of the credit must go to Holt for the way he has galvanised the team since his arrival.
There were a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was immense, at the head of a perfectly organised defence, while Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall had to be on Menga's watch throughout the match.
The Rangers lacked inspiration, however.
Despite the brilliant moments exhibited with Gerrard as coach, they have definitely not been able to maintain the level.
They did not know how to create opportunities (only once they clearly overcame the local defense), and this the Rangers, which is in the middle of the table, should be taken as a warning.
Erdogan's bittersweet reception in Cologne
It was all smiles and clear skies on Saturday (September 29th) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the first day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aimed to repair relations between the two NATO allies.
These had deteriorated due to issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then traveled to Cologne to inaugurate a new giant mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population in the world outside of Turkey.
The police claimed security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from congregating in front of the mosque, although a large number of supporters gathered in the vicinity to see its president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, also made themselves heard while condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
Both demonstrations reflect the division of opinion surrounding the visitor, considered a hero by some German Turks and branded a dictator by others.
Deptford traffic accident: a cyclist dies when running into a car
A cyclist was killed as a result of a collision with a car in London.
The accident took place near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a heavily trafficked area of Deptford, southeast of the city, at around 10:15 a.m. local time.
The driver of the vehicle stopped and, although the paramedics attended to the cyclist, he died on the spot.
The crash comes months after another cyclist was killed in a hit-and-run accident on Childers Street, a mile (1.6 km) from the scene of Saturday's crash.
The Metropolitan Police said its officers were working to identify the man and report the incident to close family members.
The street has been cut and detours have been applied to bus routes. In addition, drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in altercation
Six prison officers have been injured in an altercation at the high-security men's prison, according to the center's office.
The incident took place in Long Lartin Prison, Worcestershire, at around 09:30 on Sunday, local time, and is still ongoing.
Specialized "tornado" agents moved to the scene to end the altercation, in which eight inmates have been involved. The riot has been contained by one side.
Officers had to be treated for minor injuries to the face at the scene.
According to a prison service spokesman: "We have deployed specially trained prison staff to try to resolve an incident in Long Martin prison, which is still ongoing.
Six employees had to be treated for injuries.
We will not tolerate violence in our prisons. We are clear that those responsible for this altercation will have to be held accountable to the police and may have to spend even more time in the garjola".
The Long Lartin Correctional Facility holds more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous offenders.
In June, it was learned that the head of the prison had to be treated in a hospital after being attacked by an inmate.
In addition, in October last year, riot police made an appearance in prison to resolve a serious altercation in which center staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with major flooding (drought areas could benefit)
It is not common for a tropical depression to affect Arizona, but that is precisely what is likely to happen early next week when what is left of Hurricane Rosa passes through the southwestern desert, with the consequent risk of flooding.
The national weather service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to arrive directly in Phoenix on Tuesday and approach it on a rainy Monday night.
The Phoenix National Weather Service said in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status within a 322 km radius of Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was 40 miles (64 km) from the Arizona border.
The most recent models of the National Hurricane Center predict 50 to 100 mm of rain, with isolated points where up to 150 mm would be recorded in the Arizona Mogollon.
Other areas of the southwestern desert, including the central Rockies and the Great Basin, could record 25–50 mm, with the possibility of isolated points of up to 100 mm.
For the areas that are out of risk of floods, the rain of the Rosa could become very good news, since the region suffers a strong drought.
Although floods are a serious cause for concern, some of the rainfall could be very beneficial, as the southwest region is currently experiencing a drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Control Service, more than 40 percent of the state of Arizona suffers at least extreme drought, the second-highest category, weather.com reports.
But first, Hurricane Rosa will make landfall on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa continued to have hurricane strength on Sunday morning, with maximum winds of 137 km/h, and is now 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm is finding cooler waters in the Pacific, causing it to lose strength.
Therefore, it is expected to make landfall in Mexico with tropical storm force on Monday afternoon or evening.
Rainfall in different parts of Mexico could be heavy, with a considerable risk of flooding.
According to weather.com, "a total of 75 to 150 mm of rain is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with the possibility of up to 250 mm."
After that, Rosa will head north across Mexico with tropical storm force, before arriving at the Arizona border early Tuesday morning with tropical depression force, to finally cross Arizona and reach southern Utah well into Tuesday night.
"The main risk we expect from Rosa or what's left of it is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the desert southwest of the U.S.," according to the National Hurricane Center.
The rains are expected to cause dangerous floods and waste streams in the deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenager was found with injuries in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 4:00 a.m. local time on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital, where he is "stable".
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested the next day in the Radstock area, according to police in Avon and Somerset.
The agents have made a call for anyone who may have some kind of recording of the events with the mobile phone to contact.
Trump says Kavanaugh has 'suffered the pettiness and anger' of the Democratic Party
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is the vote to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at an election rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has "suffered the pettiness and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying the accusation of Christine Blasey Ford of sexually abusing her decades ago, when they were both teenagers.
Ford also testified in court in relation to his allegation.
The president said Saturday that, on that day, "the American people saw the genius, the human quality, and the courage" of Kavanaugh.
“The vote to ratify Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to ratify one of the most brilliant minds in the legal world of our time, a jurist with an admirable track record of service to the citizenry,” he told the crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment while speaking of the importance of the Republican voter turnout in midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
“I’m not running, but I’m actually going,” he said.
"That's why I'm going everywhere fighting for our great candidates."
Trump argued that Democrats are devoting themselves to “resisting and obstructing.”
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's appointment is expected to take place no later than Friday, an aide to Republican party leaders told CNN.
Hundreds killed by earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, where the death toll continues to rise
At least 384 people have died, and many have been swept away by giant waves crashing onto beaches, as a severe earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday for a beach festival in the city of Palu when waves of up to six meters hit the coast towards dusk, dragging many of the people to their deaths and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was followed by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat came yesterday, people were still carrying out their activities on the beach and did not run immediately. That's why they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the BNPB disaster mitigation agency, said in a statement in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, it dragged cars, logs, houses, it destroyed everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had travelled over open sea at speeds of 800 km/h before impacting the coast.
There are people who climbed to the top of a tree fleeing the tsunami and were able to survive, he says.
Some 16,700 people had to be evacuated to 24 different centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster mitigation agency show the number of shops and buildings destroyed, bridges turned and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to rock this coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
Indonesia's technology assessment and application agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's intense earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
According to the agency, the geographical characteristics of the city, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, could have exponentially increased the magnitude of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "considerable" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims, he said, were found trapped among the rubble of collapsed buildings, with 540 people injured and 29 missing.
According to Nugroho, deaths and damage could increase on the coast about 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donggala, closer to the earthquake's epicenter.
The communications "were completely paralyzed and therefore no information came in" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its workers and volunteers were heading towards the affected areas.
“It’s a tragedy that could end up much worse,” he said.
The agency was heavily criticised on Saturday for failing to report the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, although officials said the waves came during the time the warning was issued.
In a recording by a fan shared on social media, you can hear a man standing on the top floor of a building giving desperate shouts of warning to the people on the street about the approaching tsunami.
In a matter of minutes, a wall of water bursts on the seashore, taking away buildings and vehicles.
Reuters could not immediately authenticate the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami have caused a widespread power outage that has disrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Although the army has begun sending humanitarian aid in cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, according to authorities, evacuees still desperately need food, in addition to other basic needs.
The city's airport has been reopened only for relief work and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami is over 800.
The situation is very serious.
Although World Vision workers in Donggala were able to arrive safely in the city of Palu, where the employees are sheltered in canvas shelters installed in the courtyard of their office, during the journey they had to witness scenes of total destruction, Doseba says.
“They said they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
It's a catastrophe.
Although aid groups made the bleak gesture of starting relief work, some people complained that aid workers were being prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, the collection of funds, provisions and staffing from abroad can only begin to flow if the place where a disaster has occurred is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“Once the government says ‘well, it’s a national disaster,’ we can start asking for international assistance, but that level has not yet been declared.”
As the second night in Palu fell after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, the friends and relatives of the missing people held out hope that the miracle would occur and their loved ones would avoid the bleak account of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a child trapped in a sewer was rescued.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been buried under the rubble for two days with her mother’s body at her side.
Gendon Subandono, the head coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which concluded earlier this month in Indonesia.
In addition to Mr. Mandagi, among the people trapped in the Roa Roa hotel were his students.
“As a senior in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional charge,” he said.
Mr. Gendon explained that, in the hours following the news of the Roa Roa hotel collapse among the paragliding community, he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to Palu’s competitors who were participating in the beach festival.
However, the messages appeared with a grey check mark instead of a blue double check mark.
“I think that means the messages were not received,” he added.
Thieves steal $26,750 while filling up a cash machine in Newport on the Levee
Last Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's worker who was filling a cash machine in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release issued by the Newport Police Department.
Officer Dennis McCarthy said in the statement that the driver of the vehicle was emptying the ATM at the entertainment complex and was preparing it to distribute more money.
While he was doing his job, another man "ran up behind the Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money intended for distribution.
According to the statement, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not specify the number of those involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West to change his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
On Saturday, while announcing the change on Twitter, he wrote: "The being formally known as Kanye West."
He was nicknamed Ye in West, 41, and used that alias as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of her appearance on Saturday Night Live, where she is expected to present her new album, titled Yandhi.
The rapper replaces singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her participation for "emotional reasons", according to the author of the program.
Apart from being an abbreviation of his current stage name, West had previously commented that the word has a religious meaning to him.
“I think it’s the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means you,” West said earlier this year, while discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
“As you are, so are we.
I’ve gone from Kanye, which means the only one, to simply Ye, which is a reflection of our good part, our bad part, our confused part, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
West is part of a series of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has been known by several names, such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, a former collaborator of West, has used his nickname with or without a hyphen and in capital letters.
Mexico's President AMLO vows not to use military force against civilians
Mexico’s president-elect, Andrés Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador, has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country marks the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador vowed on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that "military force would never again be used to repress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the army opened fire during a peaceful demonstration and caused the death of 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were taking root throughout Latin America.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador, who has pledged to support young Mexicans by awarding monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities,
He stated that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities make young people feel attracted to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its funding for AI
“While China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount of money it spends on artificial intelligence research,” said Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and AI professional who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several members of the U.S. government have announced measures on AI, despite a general lack of formal AI strategy in the country.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: its goal is to become the world’s No. 1 for AI innovation by 2030.
“Duplicating the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that the rest of the countries are far behind the U.S. and we want to be the pioneers of the next breakthroughs in the field of AI,” Lee said.
“Doubling funding could double the chances that the U.S. will make the next big discovery in AI,” Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of the book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China’s most prominent AI companies.
In 1980 he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that overtook the top-ranked American Othello player and subsequently served as an executive at Microsoft Research and as president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee positively valued previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Robotics Challenge, and wondered when the next one would take place in order to identify future visionaries.
“Often, American researchers have to work hard to get public grants,” Lee said.
According to Lee, "It's not China that's taking the academic leaders; it's the companies."
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired university eminences to work in the field of AI.
Lee said the U.S. AI effort could also be boosted by changes in immigration policy.
“I think permanent residency cards should be offered automatically to PhD students in AI,” he added.
In July 2017, the State Council of China presented its state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence Development Plan.
“China’s National Natural Sciences Foundation awards funds to individuals from academic institutions in the same way that the Natural Sciences Foundation and other U.S. public agencies give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is inferior to China,” Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, designed to bring together partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the Natural Sciences Foundation, it currently allocates more than 100 million USD per year to AI research.
Meanwhile, for months no measure has been applied in relation to the US legislation that sought to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians hold referendum to decide whether to change country's name
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people held a referendum on the name change to “Republic of Northern Macedonia”, a measure that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia’s applications for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbour constitutes a claim to its territory and has banned it from joining NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's mostly Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not participate in the referendum, and a boycott campaign has raised doubts about whether the required 50 percent turnout will be reached for the referendum to be valid.
The question indicated on the ballot paper of the referendum is: <0xC2><0xAB>Are you in favor of joining NATO and the EU, with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?<0xC2><0xBB>.
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to achieve membership of Macedonia, one of the countries that were created in the wake of the breakup of Yugoslavia, in bodies such as the EU and NATO.
“Today I came to vote for the future of the country, so that the young people of Macedonia can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because it means that all of us will have a safer life,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of parliamentarians have stated that they will abide by the result of the vote to make it decisive.
To change the name, a two-thirds majority in Parliament is required.
The State Electoral Commission reported that there had been no irregularities at 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% recorded in the last parliamentary elections, held in 2016, in which 66% of registered people voted.
“I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” Gjose Tanevski, 62, said in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko voted in the referendum held in Macedonia on the name change of the country, which would open the way for it to join the European Union and NATO in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the Skopje Parliament, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage and placing chairs in front of the tents installed by the people who would boycott the referendum.
“We are in favor of NATO and the EU, but we want to adhere to it with our heads held high, not through the back door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, and be part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says joining NATO will be accompanied by more than necessary investments in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
“I think the vast majority will vote for it, because more than 80 percent of citizens are in favor of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said.
Zaev said a “yes” would be the “confirmation of our future.”
In a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Political Research Institute, between 30% and 43% of voters would take part in the referendum, a figure below the minimum turnout needed.
According to the results of another poll, conducted by the Macedonian TV channel Telma TV, 57% of those polled are expected to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote “yes.”
For the referendum to be valid, the turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
A failure in the referendum would be the first hard blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it took over in May last year.
Watch the video: Manchester City's Sergio Ag<0xC3><0xBC>ero makes a goal after haggling all over Brighton's defence
Sergio Ag<0xC3><0xBC>ero and Raheem Sterling overturned Brighton's defence in Manchester City's 2-0 win at Etihad Stadium, Manchester (England) on Saturday.
Ag<0xC3><0xBC>ero scored a goal in the 65th minute in a move that seemed ridiculously simple.
The Argentine forward received a pass in the middle of the field at the start of the sequence.
He sped between Brighton's three defences, smashing whatever came his way across the pitch.
Later, Ag<0xC3><0xBC>ero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He dribbled a defence before overtaking a few more on the edge of the Brighton area.
Then he made a pass to his left which found Sterling.
The English striker returned the ball on the first touch, inside the area, to Ag<0xC3><0xBC>ero, who with his right leg beat the Brighton goalkeeper, Mathew Ryan, with a shot that slipped inside the net on the right side.
“Aguero has discomfort in his foot,” City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We decided to play between 55 and 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We’re lucky that he scored a goal at that time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial lead in the fight for the Premier League.
His goal came in the 29th minute.
In that play, Ag<0xC3><0xBC>ero received the ball in depth in Brighton's field and
He made a lovely pass into space on the left side towards Leroy Sane.
Sane drove the ball before passing it to Sterling on the long stick.
The Sky Blues forward finished the ball inside the net before heading out the back line.
City face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage on Tuesday at 18:55 at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer, without options, wants to eliminate the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the playoffs, there was little reason to force another opening.
But Scherzer, who is very competitive, hopes to go to the pitching mound next Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, in case the Rockies, who hold a game advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western National League, have a chance to play the playoffs.
The Rockies secured a wild card with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still looking to clinch their first division title.
“Even if we don’t play anything, at least we can go out and pitch knowing the atmosphere here in Denver, and knowing that the other team will probably play every point at the highest level, as no one has done this year.
Why would I want to lose this game?”
The Nationals have yet to announce an opener for Sunday, but they are apparently determined to let Scherzer throw if that situation occurs.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th opening, did a warm-up session on Thursday and would pitch on Sunday, his usual day off.
The right-handed pitcher from Washington has an 18-7 record, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump to hold rally in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation around his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, while speaking of the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
There are five weeks left until one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is one of the big, big.. I do not present myself, but in reality I do present myself. That is why I am everywhere fighting for the fantastic candidates, "he said.
Trump continued, “You can see this horrible, horrible group of Democrats, it’s happening right now.
They are determined to regain power by all necessary means, their pettiness is seen, their evil intention.
They don’t care who they hurt, over who they have to go through to get power and control. That’s what they want: power and control. But we won’t give them to them.”
The mission of the Democrats, he said, is to “resist and obstruct.”
“And you can see that in the last four days,” he said, calling Democrats “sick, mean, dirty, and fake.”
Trump mentioned Dianne Feinstein, the highest-ranking democratic senator on the Senate Judiciary Committee, prompting a loud outcry from the public.
“Do you remember his answer?
Did you filter the document?
Hey, hey, what?
No, hey, no. Wait a minute... That was a very bad body language expression, the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party is no longer a party.
He is intolerant of those who say what they think.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, I wasn’t surprised.
After all, I am the latest in a series of British MPs who have told us that we are not welcome, just to say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she spoke out with determination against anti-Semitism.
In my case, with the motion of censure I was criticized for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe. Ironically, these are similar issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
In the announcement of the Friday meeting of the Labour Party in Nottingham it was communicated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the General Committee meetings held on Friday night have been exactly like this.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings, and the promise of “more generous and kind” policies, if it ever existed, has long since been forgotten.
It is increasingly evident that divergent views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and each opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, as colleagues with whom he once thought he shared a similar political vision expected me to make a 180-degree turn and take positions I would never have taken, either on national security or on the EU’s single market.
Whenever I speak in public, whatever I say, social media is filled with aggressive messages calling for my candidacy not to be renewed, denouncing centrist policies and telling me that I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
And that doesn’t just happen to me.
In fact, I know that I am luckier than some of my colleagues, since the messages I receive are usually political.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who every day have to deal with a torrent of sexist and racist attacks, and they do not grind.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is to see how the level of abuse has been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn declared last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that diverse party, and with every motion of “no confidence” or every change in the rules of selection, the party is getting tighter.
In the last two years I have received a lot of advice and I have been recommended to keep my head down, not to be so expressive and “everything would be fine”.
I didn’t get into politics for that.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago, in my time as a student, spurred on by Thatcher’s negligent government, which left my entire class literally sunk, I have been trying to advocate for better public services for those who need them most, whether as a local councillor or as a government minister.
I have never hidden my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way doubt my political positions and points of disagreement with the current direction.
To those who pushed the motion on Friday, I would say that at a time when the country is moving towards a Brexit that will harm homes, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But, in fact, the message I want to convey is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of non-renewal of my candidacy or any political interest will prevent me from acting, in my view, in the interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: undefeated Ayr lead
Two last-minute tries distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that the Ayr deserved victory in this vibrant match of the day of Tennent's Premiership.
The Ayrs, who are the only unbeaten team in the ten, occupy the first position in the standings.
In the end, the home team prevailed thanks to their defensive superiority and the fact that they knew how to take better advantage of the opportunities, and coach Peter Murchie had reason to be satisfied.
“The games we have played so far have tested us and we are still undefeated, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose commented, "Congratulations to the Ayrs, they've made the most of the opportunity."
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute try, converted by Frazier Climo, put the Ayrs ahead, but a yellow card for Scottish international Rory Hughes, loaned out for the game by the Warriors, allowed the Melroses to take advantage of numerical superiority and Jason Baggot scored an unconverted try.
Climo extended Ayr's lead with a penalty and, just in the middle, scored and converted a try to put the score 17-5 in Ayr's favor at rest.
But the Melroses got off to a good start in the second half and Baggot's converted Patrick Anderson's rehearsal narrowed the gap to five points.
Afterwards, the match was interrupted for a long time due to the serious injury suffered by Ruaridh Knott, who retired on a litter, and in the second half the Ayrs extended the distance again with a try by Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
Then backup captain Blair Macpherson was reprimanded with a yellow card and, again, the Melroses took advantage of one more man's superiority with an unconverted rehearsal of Bruce Colvine at the end of a few moments of heavy pressure.
However, the home team reacted and when Struan Hutchinson saw yellow card for a tackle on Climo without a ball, from the penalty line-up, MacPherson scored a counter-test behind the Ayr's penetrating mole.
Climo scored, as he had done almost since the shootout, after Kyle Rowe picked up a shot from David Armstrong and passed the ball to third row wing Gregor Henry to score the home team's fifth practice.
The star of the series Still Game seems to be ready to start a new career in the catering sector
Ford Kieran, star of the Still Game series, appears to be ready to move into the hospitality sector, after it has been discovered that he has been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays the character of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and co-stars with Greg Hemphill, his longtime comic partner.
The duo has announced that the ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems that Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment, although a source in The Scottish Sun newspaper noted that Kiernan intended to enter Glasgow's "flourishing catering sector".
<0xC2><0xAB>The sea is ours<0xC2><0xBB>: Bolivia, landlocked, expects the court to reopen the route to the Pacific
Sailors patrol the esarcia-covered naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings wave a navy blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are crammed with the slogan: “The sea is ours by right.
Getting it back is a duty.”
Across Bolivia's landlocked territory, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a crumbling resource conflict in the 19th century remains as vivid as the yearning to sail the Pacific Ocean again.
These hopes are perhaps the deepest in decades, while Bolivia awaits the resolution that the International Court of Justice will issue on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the drive, a spirit of unity and serenity, and, needless to say, it waits with a positive attitude for the result,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the TIJ resolution on big screens across the country, in the hope that the Hague Tribunal will rule in favor of Bolivia’s claim that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate the granting of a sovereign exit to the sea for Bolivia.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president, facing a contentious battle for re-election next year, also has high hopes for Monday’s resolution.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he said.
However, some analysts think that the Court is unlikely to rule in favor of Bolivia and that, if it did, things would not change much.
The UN body based in the Netherlands has no power to award Chilean territory and has established that it will not determine the outcome of any talks.
The TIJ’s resolution, which comes just six months after the final allegations were filed, indicates that the case was “not complicated,” said Paz Zárate, a Chilean specialist in international law.
And far from being favored, Bolivia’s cause may have experienced a setback in the past four years.
“The current Bolivian administration has hijacked the issue of access to the sea,” Zárate said.
“The belligerent rhetoric of Morales has undermined any gesture of good will on the part of Chile,” he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be very difficult to hold talks after this episode.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the Court's decision-making was exceptionally rapid.
On Monday, Bolivia will have “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and an opportunity to “end 139 years of disagreements, with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains one of Latin America's most popular presidents, was using the maritime issue as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he said.
“Resolution is an opportunity to realize that we have to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen unless it can trust U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will not eliminate nuclear weapons if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke last Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
The minister urged the United States to keep the promises made during a summit held in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
His remarks come at a time when it appears that U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is poised to resume stalled nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the summit held in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it’s a chimera to think that continued U.S. sanctions and objection to a declaration ending the Korean War could ever make North Korea kneel.
Washington is wary of accepting the declaration if Pyongyang does not first make major disarmament moves.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang takes seriously the issue of giving up an arsenal that the country considers the only means to ensure its security.
Pompeo is scheduled to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest range of oversized hats, en route to a main street near you
If you want to increase the size of your hat collection or want to protect yourself completely from the sun, you do not need to look any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented on the catwalk a range of extravagant hats of disproportionate dimensions from their SS19 collection, which dazzled the style defined at Paris Fashion Week.
This summer Instagram has been swept away by very impractical hats, and these designers have brought their amazing creations to the catwalk.
Valentino's highlight was an exaggerated beige hat, adorned with a broad, feather-shaped wing, which flooded the models' heads.
Among other oversized accessories, there were jeweled watermelons, a witch's hat, and even a pineapple, but these are not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of wacky masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the brightly colored masks had lips sewn together and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation resembled a complete scuba diving team, with tube and goggles, while another looked like a cone of melted ice cream.
And if you follow the great trends of fashion, you are in luck.
Style watchers predict that huge hats could be implanted in the main streets near you.
The oversized hats step on the heels of “The Bomb,” a straw hat with a two-foot wide brim that everyone has worn, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the hat so impractical that it spread across social media brought another great creation to the runway: a straw bag for the beach, almost as big as the swimsuit-clad model who wore it.
The raffia bag, dark orange, adorned with raffia fringes and finished with a white leather handle, was the highlight of the La Riviera SS19 collection by Jacquemus at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I hope to see people wearing big hats and beach bags on the main streets next summer. Considering that the designer has had a big impact, it would be a shame that the demand for large-sized accessories was ignored.
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a track record of academic excellence that has continued into 2018 with another set of excellent exam results, which is reinforced by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community endeavors.
With more than 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to pupils and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further and higher education, for the career they choose and for their place as citizens of the world.
As an education sector that can design and implement a personalized school curriculum, we note that modern languages remain a very popular and desired subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you will get to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will reach his heart.”
This is a very important reminder that we cannot depend only on English if we want to establish relationships and build trust with people from other countries.
From the recent results of this year’s exams, we can see that languages lead the ranking tables with the highest ratings in independent schools.
68% of the students who studied foreign languages obtained a higher A grade.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS member schools reflected that 72% of students obtained a higher A grade in Mandarin, while 72% of German students, 69% of French students and 63% of Spanish students also obtained an A grade.
This shows that Scotland’s independent schools support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, languages, as a subject of choice, are held in the same consideration as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere.
A survey conducted in 2014 by the UK Employment and Skills Commission revealed that of the reasons employers gave for struggling to fill vacancies, 17% was attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly indispensable to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more potential job opportunities requiring languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future with a permanent competition like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75% could not speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, and French, with 15% of speakers, was the only language with a double-digit percentage.
For this reason, investing in language teaching is important for today’s children.
Knowing several languages, especially those from developed economies, will give children better chances of finding an important job.
In Scotland there is diversity among schools in terms of the languages they teach.
Some schools focus more on more traditional modern languages, while others teach languages that are expected to be more important to the UK going forward, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interests, they can always choose from a range of languages at independent schools, which have specialist teaching staff in this area.
Scottish Independent Schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills needed to succeed, no matter what the future throws at them.
In today’s global business environment, it cannot be denied that languages continue to be of vital importance to the country’s future, and this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered "international communicative skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It has to be done.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron to make Lakers debut in San Diego on Sunday
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James play his first game with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play Sunday in the first preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It is still to be determined how many minutes he will play.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48," Walton told the Lakers' official website.
Mike Trudell, a Lakers reporter, tweeted that James will probably play a few minutes.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
“I don’t need pre-season games at this stage of my career to be ready,” he said.
Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a wave of campaigning tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It’s the first of five rallies scheduled for Trump next week, which include visits to sympathetic sites such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the confirmation vote for his candidate to fill the Supreme Court vacancy is on hold, Trump aims to win support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when the votes are cast in November.
What time is Trump’s rally in West Virginia tonight and how can you see it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. today, Saturday, Sept. 29, 2018.
Trump’s rally in West Virginia can be viewed online at the link specified below, via live video streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address this week’s hearing with Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which was strained because of sexual abuse allegations he faces, while the Senate’s planned confirmation vote remains on hold for up to a week and the FBI is investigating the case.
But the main goal of this wave of rallies is to help Republicans running in the sensitive November election gain momentum.
So President Trump’s five campaign rallies scheduled for next week are aimed at “stimulating volunteers and supporters, while Republicans try to protect and expand the majorities they have in the Senate and House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
“Congress control is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as he can as we head into a busy campaign season,” a Trump spokesman said, declining to be named.
Tonight’s rally, scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena, Wheeling, could rally supporters “from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and draw media coverage from Pittsburgh,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time Trump visits West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate in the West Virginia Senate, who is getting some unfavorable results in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come and give him momentum in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: the American team shows its ambition to keep hopes alive for individual matches on Sunday
After three uneven sessions, Saturday afternoon foursomes were probably what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of dynamics is an invented sports concept, in which players really believe, especially in competitions like this.
So on which side is the positive dynamic now?
“They had a six-point lead and now it’s four points, so I think we’re on a small positive streak,” Jordan Spieth said as he left at the end of the day.
Obviously, Europe has an advantage, four points ahead, with twelve more at stake.
Americans, as Spieth puts it, feel the wind blow a little bit in their favor and have plenty of reason to be excited, largely because of the state of form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both score three points out of four.
Spieth has been lethal from tee to green and is setting an example.
The celebratory guttural screams rose in intensity as he continued his lap and puttted a crucial putt to tie the fourth game, when he and Thomas had been two down after two holes.
He celebrated the putt that made them win the game at hole 15 with a similar cry, the kind that indicates that he believes the American team is not yet out of the competition.
“You have to do your best and worry about your own game,” Spieth said.
That’s all that’s left for these players.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed Ryder Cup sensation.
The strange but adorable European couple wear four out of four and make no mistakes.
"Moliwood" were the only couple who didn't do a crazy Saturday afternoon, and also avoided the crazy Saturday morning and Friday afternoon, and the last nine holes Friday morning.
For this result and the way its energy seems to flow to and from the bustling public, it is reaffirmed that it is the players to beat on Sunday, and there is no player more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari to close a possible European victory while the sun sets on Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, talking about European glory seemed premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly ended up with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourballs, who teamed up with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes sank the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole from which they never had any option of exiting.
On Sunday, though, there’s no one who can help you get out of the hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are very fascinating to see because of the interactions between pairings, the advice they give and the advice they don’t give, and the way a strategy can change all at once.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and will face the last day with an important advantage, but this foursome session has shown that the US team has the motivation to fight that some, especially in the United States, had questioned.
Europe reach Ryder Cup final with 10-6 record
Europe will face the last day of the Ryder Cup with a comfortable lead after finishing Saturday’s fourballs and foursomes with a 10-6 victory over the United States.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari went to great lengths to secure two wins against a struggling Tiger Woods and leave their record, so far, in four points at Le Golf National.
The European team, led by Thomas Bjorn, who aspired to retain the trophy he lost two years ago at Hazeltine, dominated an ill-fated American team at the morning fourballs and put the series in 3-1.
The U.S. showed more resistance to the foursomes and won two games, but could not narrow the differences.
Jim Furyk's team needed to score eight points in 12 individual games on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, known as "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are only the second pair to score four points in their first four Ryder Cup games.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed into the fourballs, they put on a brilliant performance to beat a deflated Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau for an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who had trailed in two games on Saturday, showed sporadic sparks of genius, but lost 19 of 29 games in fourballs and foursomes, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who did not participate in the morning fourballs, re-teamed with Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and fell 2-1 to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, ranked first and third in the world, respectively.
However, Europe didn’t have it all figured out on a nice, windy day southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, a three-time tournament champion, and Justin Thomas set a benchmark for the Americans on Saturday by scoring two points.
They achieved a 2–1 decisive win against Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and later won again Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4–3 in the foursomes, having lost the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team made a four-point difference in individual games, although Furyk's defending team only needs to tie to retain the title.
However, after being the second best for two days, it seems that a counterattack coming Sunday is out of reach.
North Korea says it will not unilaterally disarm "in any way" if no signs of confidence are seen
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were intensifying its mistrust of the United States and that, under such circumstances, the country would not unilaterally remove its nuclear weapons in any way.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the world body that North Korea had taken "important goodwill measures" during the previous year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test center, and pledging not to proliferate nuclear weapons and technology.
“However, we do not observe any consistent response from the US,” he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances, we will not unilaterally initiate disarmament in any way.”
While Ri echoed North Korea’s well-known complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phased” denuclearization approach for which North Korea would be rewarded as it took gradual action, his statements seemed significant in that he did not reject unilateral denuclearization outright, as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referenced Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump’s joint statement at the first summit between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim pledged to work on the “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,” while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea’s security.
North Korea has tried to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first eliminate its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease tough international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
“The U.S. insists that denuclearization must occur first and increases the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its goal coercively, in addition to opposing the ‘declaration of an end to war,’” Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions will make us kneel is a chimera of people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that continued sanctions are intensifying our mistrust.”
Ri did not refer to plans to hold a second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader highlighted at the United Nations earlier in the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added, “If the party involved in the denuclearization issue were South Korea instead of the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this stalemate.”
However, the tone of Ri’s speech was very different from what he delivered last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting U.S. territory with North Korean missiles was inevitable after President “Mr. Evil” Trump dubbed Kim “Rocket Man” on a suicide mission.
At the United Nations this year, Trump, who last year threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take disarmament measures, but said much remained to be done and sanctions must be maintained until North Korea denuclearized.
Last Wednesday, Trump said there was no deadline for that and that “it doesn’t matter if it takes two years, three years or five months.”
China and Russia say the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that “the Security Council’s enforcement of sanctions must continue vigorously and without exception until we confirm full and final denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously pushed for sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in a bid to cut off funding for Pyongyang’s ballistic missile and nuclear programmes.
Pompeo met Ri outside the U.N. General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go very well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying progress had been made, but within hours North Korea accused him of making "gangster demands".
In a meeting with Moon earlier this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile center and a nuclear complex if the United States took "consistent measures".
He said Kim had communicated to him that the “measures in line” he was seeking were the security measures Trump had promised in Singapore, as well as actions toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Take a Course on Rest Habits
This year, a new course at Harvard University has allowed its students to sleep more, in an attempt to combat the culture, increasingly widespread, of studying throughout the night, stimulated by caffeine.
One academic noted that students at the world’s number one university are often clueless about the basics of taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to create the course after giving a talk about the impact sleep deprivation had on learning.
“At the end of the talk, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why are they telling me this now, in my senior year?’
He said no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” she told The Telegraph.
In the course, implemented for the first time this year, students are told the basics about how good sleep habits improve academic and sports performance, in addition to general well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after learning that some students suffered severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a bedroom, where students have to click on coffee cups, curtains, slippers and books to receive information about the effects of caffeine and light, about how sports performance affects lack of sleep, and about the importance of maintaining a bedtime routine.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
Below, a campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily route.
“We know that the behavior of students will not change immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know, as one has the right to know the health effects of smoking cigarettes,” Professor Czeisler said.
The culture of pride in staying up all night still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the growing pressure on students make sleep deprivation a growing problem.
Making sure to enjoy good quality sleep for long enough should be a “secret weapon” of students to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he added, even to avoid gaining weight, as sleep deprivation puts the brain into starvation mode and makes students always hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies Chemistry and Physical Biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, having attended one of his classes the last year during his freshman year at Harvard.
Raymond commented that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to promote the course across campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask graduate students to complete a similar program of study before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm when they go to sleep and when they wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can alter the harmony of the circadian rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal ends with Gerrard's men
Dolly Menga's goal condemns Steven Gerrard's disjointed team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston's home that is another stumble outside.
The Ibrox side were looking to add their first home win since last February's 4-1 win at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted the second loss on Gerrard in 18 games as coach to leave their team adrift, 8 points behind the unstoppable leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored the goal seven minutes before halftime, and it never seemed that the uninspired Rangers were about to equal the score.
While the Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston rise to third position, behind the Hibernian by goal difference.
And the Rangers could face more difficulties later, as line judge Calum Spence needed medical attention for a head injury caused by an object apparently thrown from the stands.
Gerrard made eight changes to the line-up that swept the Ayrs to the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, came out with the same eleven starter who kicked off a point against the Hearts last week. Surely, he was pleased with the way his well-organized team suffocated their rivals at all times.
While the Rangers dominated possession, Livingston created more danger when they had the ball.
In fact, they should have scored in the two minutes of the match, when Menga's first intervention left Scot Pittman alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder threw off and missed the big occasion.
A hard free kick from Keaghan Jacobs ran into Captain Craig Halkett, but defensive partner Alan Lithgow only made a deflected kick to the back post.
The Rangers took control, but seemed to have more hope than faith in their game in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos really believed that he should have had a penalty on the 15-minute mark, as he and Steven Lawless collided, but referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's claims.
The Rangers only directed two free kicks in the first half, but Ibrox's first goalkeeper Liam Kelly had no problem with Lassana Coulibaly's header and forward Ovie Ejaria.
While the Livi’s first act in the 34th minute could have been against the race, no one can deny that they deserved it just for their effort.
Again, the Rangers were unable to cope with Jacobs's hard-worked play.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool to pick Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard took the break by switching Coulibaly to Ryan Kent. The switch had an almost immediate impact as the winger made a pass to Morelos, although the imposing Kelly ran into the blockade.
However, the Livingstons continued to capture the attention of visitors by playing exactly as they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett taking long passes, one after the other.
Holt's side might have given way in the final stages, but McGregor stood firm to reject Jacobs before Lithgow threw a deflected shot from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton still asked for one last penalty for a dispute with Jacobs, but Thomson again turned a blind eye.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from the "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and counting... the day that the physicist of the future, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device we know as the "Geiger counter".
The Geiger counter, which has been a pillar of science ever since, also became a pop culture pile, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, a seemingly unsuccessful cowboy physicist:
Man: “What the hell is that?”
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can hear the effects of the atoms emanating from the radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: "Sure it's exploding now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to “see” malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” and eliminate malignant cells
Vaccine Teaches Immune System to Recognize Malignant Cells as Part of Treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory.
You can "see" a protein common to many cancers and then reinject them
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with various types of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw the ovarian cancer she suffered from disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory to be able to "see" a protein present in many types of cancer (HER2), and then injecting them again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “The results we have obtained suggest that we have a promising vaccine.”
The HER2 protein "favors the growth of several types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, Berzofsky said.
A similar approach consisting of extracting immune cells from patients and “teaching” these cells how to treat cancer cells has worked in the treatment of one type of leukemia.
Kanye West engaged in a pro-Trump diatribe with a MAGA cap after his performance on the SNL show.
It didn't end well
Kanye West was written into the studio during Saturday Night Live after a chaotic performance in which he congratulated U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run in the 2020 election.
After his third song of the night, titled Ghost Town, in which he wore a Make America Great Again cap, he began to criticize the Democrats and reiterate his support for Trump.
“Whenever I talk to white people, they say, ‘How can you like Trump if he’s racist?’
Well, if I worried about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL program began with a parody by Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee over allegations of sexual assault filed by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it did not air, comedian Chris Rock uploaded the recording of West's disapproval on social media.
It was unclear whether Rock intended to ridicule West with the publication.
However, West has complained to the public that he was not well treated behind the scenes because of the cap he wore.
“They threatened me behind the scenes.
They told me not to go out with that hat on.
They harassed me.
And then they say I'm in a lower position," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the bottom position?" while saying he would put on the Superman cape so they wouldn't tell him what to do. "Do you want the world to move forward?
Try to love."
His comments provoked public outcry at least twice and the show's crew members seemed embarrassed, according to Variety, which had a reporter who told the publication: "The whole studio went completely silent."
West was brought in as a last-minute replacement for Ariana Grande, whose ex, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West left much of the audience bewildered with the performance of the song "I Love It", disguised as Perrier's bottle.
West won the support of TPUSA's conservative group leader Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR HIGHLIGHTING THE MULTITUDE."
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply “being who he is and that is absolutely wonderful.”
“But I have chosen not to reward someone (by buying their music or clothing or supporting their ‘art’) who I believe espouses and spreads an ideology that harms my community.
He is free.
And so do we,” he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and that he was now "the being formerly known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg, was formerly called Snoop Lion and the now-defunct music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and subsequently the artist formerly known as Prince.
Man charged with attempted murder for stabbing in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder following the stabbing of a man in east Belfast on Friday.
According to police, the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The accused is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
Prosecutors will review the charges.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington denounces toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for playing the role of the swashbuckling Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor has denounced the stereotype of a manly hero, saying that these roles imply that young boys often believe that they must be strong to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times' Culture magazine, Kit said he believed "something had gone wrong" and questioned how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, 31, has admitted that he is determined to tackle the problem.
“Personally, I now wonder where we have gone wrong when it comes to masculinity,” he says.
“What have we taught men during their development in relation to the problem we are experiencing now?”
According to Kit, television may bear some responsibility for the rise of toxic masculinity thanks to its manly characters.
He added: "What is innate and what is acquired?
What is taught on TV and on the streets that makes young boys feel that they must have this facet of virility?
I think it’s one of the big questions of our time: how do we change it?
Because something has definitely gone wrong with the young boys.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not make any prequels or sequels to Game of Thrones when the series finale is scheduled for next summer, saying that he is fed up with battles and horses.
Starting in November, Kit will star in a remake of Sam Shepard’s True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his partner Rose is the best thing that Game of Thrones has given him.
“I met my wife on the show, so she gave me my future family and my life going forward,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on Leslie’s family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, according to health officials.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases are of sexual transmission, unlike in the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some regions of China due to infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people contracting HIV from this cause has been reduced to almost zero, according to statements by Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community is common.
Taking into account the conservative values of the country, studies estimate that between 70 and 90% of men who have homosexual relations will end up marrying a woman.
Many of the transmissions of disease are due to the lack of adequate precautions for sexual intercourse.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee leaked data from Republican Party senators and dismantles "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information about three Republican U.S. senators on the pages of the Wikipedia of lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed the lawsuits were driven by critics and far-right websites.
“Lies, lies and more despicable lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
Allegedly, the published information contained the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday and was published by someone unknown on Capitol Hill during a session of the Senate committee on sexual abuse allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The information leaked after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the postings was related to the Waters office and that it revealed the information of a Waters staff member, the Capitol reported.
“This unsubstantiated allegation is completely false and a sheer lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of my staff, whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised due to these false and fraudulent reports, was not responsible in any way for this leak of information.
This baseless denunciation is utterly false and a sheer invention.”
Waters' statement drew criticism online quickly, including that of former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is full of outrage,” Fleischer wrote.
“It makes you think you don’t have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn’t do, they shouldn’t be angry.
You don’t have to be challenging.
You don't have to question the accuser's motives.
You have to stay calm and calm.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to criticism from Democrats of Judge Kavanaugh, whom critics accused of looking too angry during Thursday's session.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running to oust Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
“It doesn’t matter if it’s true,” he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted the relevant authorities and security forces to these fraudulent statements.
"We will ensure that the offenders are revealed," he continued, "and that they will be held legally responsible for all actions they have taken that have harmed each and every one of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Again review: Rowan Atkinson's limited spy parody
It is already tradition to look for references to Brexit in any new film with a British approach, and this replacement of the franchise of the action-comedy parody of Johnny English, which was born in 2003 with Johnny English and re-appeared in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn, is no exception.
This humorous self-satisfaction about how despicable we are will be a new export opportunity for the country?
In any case, the out-eyed and rubber-faced incompetent Johnny English has been able to renew for the second time his license to twist everything. His name indicates more than anything else that he is a comic creation designed for non-English speaking territories with a tradition of going to the movies.
Evidently, it is the stupid secret agent who, despite his rare claims of liquefied glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a point of Mr. Bean and a touch of this guy who brings a single note to the theme of Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
Originally, it was based on the international and mysterious traveler Atkinson who represented Barclaycard’s now-forgotten TV commercials, where he was sowing chaos everywhere.
There are one or two good moments in this last journey of JE.
I loved the Johnny English who walked up to a helicopter in medieval armor and the blades of the propeller chimed into his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is seen, but the humor seems rather loose and strangely superfluous, especially since "serious" movie brands like 007 and Mission Impossible now include comedy as an ingredient.
The humor seems intended for children rather than adults and, to me, Johnny English's absurd adventures are not as witty or focused as the silent gags of the Mr. Bean character Atkinson represents.
The repeatedly topical premise now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A hacker has infiltrated the British super-secret web spy network and revealed the identities of every British agent on the ground, much to the dismay of the serving agent, a woefully small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last resort for a prime minister who is a pretentious and harassed figure, who already suffers a total collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives her best with this character pressed Teresa-May, but the script does not come any further.
His intelligence advisers inform him that, as each active spy is put in danger, he will have to recover some from retirement.
And that includes clumsy Johnny English, now employed as a professor at some fancy institution, but teaching off-the-books classes on how to become a covert agent, with some good gags, such as when English offers a spy academy that looks like a rock school.
English is quickly returned to Whitehall for an emergency meeting with his long-suffering henchman Bough, a role played again by Ben Miller.
Now Bough is a married man, tied to the commander of a submarine, an enthusiastic role, in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
Thus, the Batman and Robin of when things get very ugly in Her Majesty's secret service come into action once again and find in Olga Kurylenko the spectacular "femme fatale" Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls dangerously under the spell of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, represented by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous craziness: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French fast-food restaurant, they smuggle chaos aboard Volta's luxury yacht, and English causes great confusion when trying to use a virtual reality helmet to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
All the stops have certainly been taken from this last sequence, but with all the simplicity and noise it presents, it all looks like a children's program.
Pretty normal things.
As with Johnny English's other films, it hasn't been helpful to think about whether the film industry has given Rowan Atkinson a role that does his talent justice.
The Labour Party denies that it is devising a plan for the British to have a four-day working week and cover five days.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party will have to consider a radical plan whereby the British will work four days a week and charge five.
Supposedly, the party wants the bosses of the companies to pass on the savings obtained with the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to the workers by giving them one more day of celebration.
The employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but would receive the same salary.
According to the sources, the idea would fit with the party’s economic agenda and plans to tilt the country in favor of workers.
The change to a four-day work week is supported by the Trades Union Congress as a method for workers to take advantage of economic change.
An experienced Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: "A review of the policy is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
It won’t be overnight, but a four-day workweek is an aspiration that fits the party’s perspective of balancing the economy in favor of the worker and the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party does not currently support this aspiration jointly.
According to a Labour Party spokesman: "A four-day working week is not party policy and the party is not considering it."
Shadow minister John McDonnell used last week’s party conference to detail his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell expressed his determination to restore the power of "anonymous directors" and "speculators" to utility companies.
The shadow minister’s plans also imply that the shareholders of the water companies might not recoup the entire investment, as the Labour government could apply “deductions” for the crimes it perceives.
It has also confirmed plans to place workers on company boards and create inclusive ownership funds to deliver 10% of the shares of private sector firms to employees, who expect to pocket annual dividends worth up to GBP 500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy explains to "60 Minutes" if the FBI's Kavanaugh investigation could change their minds.
The FBI’s investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote of his Supreme Court nomination by at least a week, and has raised the question of whether the agency’s findings could sway any Republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview to be published on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring anything to light that would change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I'm serious," Kennedy said.
"At the hearing I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when everything happened and the accusations were made public, and I asked him if he had done it.
He was strong, determined, and confident.”
But Graham's vote seems set on fire.
“I have my own opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and I would present an explosive indictment,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it outright," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of the people I name will be able to verify it.
He's 36.
I don’t see anything changing.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event featuring an absolutely stunning program of stars who carry out an equally impressive mission: to eradicate poverty in the world.
In its seventh edition this year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people gather in the Great Lawn area of Central Park not only to enjoy performances such as those of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event’s global goal of ending extreme poverty in the world by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who actively help fight it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (unless someone wants to pay for a VIP ticket), attendees had to do a series of tasks or “actions,” such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or any other activity to raise awareness about the goal of ending poverty.
What successes has Global Citizen achieved now that it has 12 years to reach its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a good way to persuade them to demand a call to action or just one more case of what we call “clictivism” (people who think it makes a difference to sign an online petition or send a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have registered more than 19 million “actions” of its supporters, which have helped achieve various goals.
He says these actions have helped spur world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion, which will have impacted the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements derived from its actions, from which at least USD 10 billion has already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that so far protected funds have had a direct impact on almost 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments include The Power of Nutrition foundation, an association of investors and filmmakers based in the UK, which is committed to “helping children grow as much as possible” and promises to send to Rwanda $35 million to help fight malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and members of Global Citizens, like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a footnote in history,” The Power of Nutrition’s ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also explained that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the P+F’s on her website asking “what makes you think we can end extreme poverty?”,
Global Citizen responded: "It will be a long and hard road. Sometimes, we will fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements of the past, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.”
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who will perform at this year's event in New York, which will feature Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy as a “blockade” to hinder Russian energy exports (Secretary of the Interior)
Washington can, “if necessary,” turn to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from hitting markets, including those in the Middle East, U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said.
Zinke has denounced that Russia’s intervention in Syria, mainly where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
“I think the reason they are in the Middle East is their willingness to negotiate with energy, as they already do in Eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe,” he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to address this issue.
“The United States has the capability, along with the Navy, to ensure that the waterways are open and, if necessary, for blockade, to prevent its energy from entering the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed attendees at the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that calls itself the “voice of the energy consumer” in the U.S.
He compared Washington’s strategies for negotiating with Russia and Iran, noting that they are effectively equal.
“The economic option in Iran and Russia is, more or less, to take advantage of and replace fuels,” he said, while indicating that Russia has only one resource, since its economy depends on fossil fuels.
The statements come as the Trump administration has been on a mission to boost the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the most economical option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to exit the “inadequate” Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which Trump says made Berlin “captive” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which has cost $11 billion and will double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fervent opposition to the project is simply due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers, said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with US Department of Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position has provoked a negative response from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading energy industry organisation, FDI (Federation of German Industries), has called on the US to move away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply,” Dieter Kempf, director of BDI (Federation of German Industries) said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will “think carefully” about her candidacy for president in 2020.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she would "think carefully" about her candidacy for president after the midterm elections.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidacy.
“The time has come for women to go to Washington and fix the government fracture, for women to hold high office,” she said.
“After November 6, I will take my candidacy for president seriously.”
Warren weighed in on President Donald Trump during the town hall meeting and said he was “taking the country in the wrong direction.”
“I’m frankly concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been outspoken in her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet Friday, Warren said: "Clearly an FBI investigation is needed before the election."
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren’s own voters believed he should not run for office by 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts’ “probable” voters have said the senator should not run, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent would support the bid.
The poll revealed broader support for former Governor Deval Patrick’s candidacy, with 38 percent in favor of a possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other high-profile names among Democrats who were considered in connection with a possible 2020 candidacy include Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially reveal his decision in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin cites PTSD sufferer Track Palin at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin spent a year in Iraq after enlisting on September 11, 2007.
He was arrested Monday night and charged with domestic violence.
“With what my own son has been going through since he came back, I can understand other families suffering from PTSD ramifications and some of the emotional wounds that our soldiers return with,” he told the audience at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "the elephant in the room" and said the following of his son and other war veterans: "They become a little different, they come back hardened, they come back wondering if there is any respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots, as well as any other members of the military, have given to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, with a statement for domestic violence and possession of weapons while under the influence of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and DC support challenging a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the legal challenge to a new U.S. policy denying asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence
Representatives from 18 states and the district filed an amicus curiae Friday in Washington to support a policy-defying asylum seeker, according to NBC News.
The full name of the Grace vs. Sessions lawsuit that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and the children of the violent gang member" assaulted her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum request on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers from states that support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where large numbers of asylum seekers are generated in the U.S., as countries facing widespread gang problems and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals, which allowed undocumented immigrants to flee domestic violence to seek asylum.
District Attorney General Karl Racine said Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal and international law.”
Federal laws require asylum claims to be adjudicated according to the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and this prohibition violates this principle, according to the amicus curiae.
Lawyers also argued in the report that the policy denying the entry of immigrants hurts the U.S. economy as they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide necessary jobs.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gangs.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their country out of persecution or fear for reasons of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in his June 11 announcement of the policy.
Asylum has never sought to alleviate all the problems, not even the most serious ones, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as human losses multiply in a sprint to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is increasingly desperate.
“The atmosphere is very tense,” said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma as she calmed her son with a fever at an evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
"Every minute, an ambulance carries bodies.
There is no drinking water.”
Residents have been seen returning to their destroyed homes to grab flooded belongings and try to save what they can.
Hundreds of people have been injured, and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5-magnitude quake, are saturated.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who has fractured his shoulder, are outside the Palu military hospital, as patients are treated outside due to repeated heavy shaking.
Tears streamed down his eyes as he explained how the violent earthquake shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save us.
He was stuck in the ruins of the wall, I think,” Haris told The Associated Press, adding that his family had attended a wedding in the village.
“I heard my wife crying for help and then I didn’t hear her anymore.
I don’t know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they are well.”
The US ambassador accuses China of besieging itself with “propaganda ads”.
A week after an official Chinese publication ran a four-page ad in an American newspaper promoting the mutual advantages of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China has accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
President Donald Trump on Wednesday addressed China Daily's pay supplement to The Des Moines Register, Iowa's top-selling newspaper, after accusing China of meddling in the Nov. 6 U.S. congressional election, an accusation China denies.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to meddle in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials have told Reuters is a new phase in Washington’s campaign to step up pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to insert advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an intensifying trade war that has seen tariffs on mutual imports rise.
China’s retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were aimed at punishing exporters from states, such as Iowa, that supported Trump’s Republican Party, according to Chinese and U.S. experts.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and longtime former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
In China, Branstad wrote in an op-ed in The Sunday's The Des Moines Register: "It is redoubled harassment by publishing propaganda advertisements in our free press."
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the cherished American tradition of free speech and free press by inserting a paid ad in The Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, at the kiosk down the street here in Beijing, you will find few dissenting voices and see no real reflection of the disparate opinions that Chinese citizens may have about China’s troubling economic trajectory, given that the media is dominated by the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers dodged the offer to publish" his article, but did not say the name of the publication.
Republicans pull out women voters ahead of midterm elections with Kavanaugh disaster, analysts warn
With many of the top Republicans backing and defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who faces multiple lawsuits for sexual assault, analysts have warned they will see a backlash, especially among women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding this case are extremely high and most Republicans already officially show that they want to take a step forward with a vote.
These things can’t be undone,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, told The Hill for a paper published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)’s last-minute push for an FBI investigation is enough to appease angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday, tomorrow or in November,” Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, said on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C., daily.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" as they rallied in the Senate lobby as Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee decided to continue Kavanaugh's nomination despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, according to the Mic.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be left off the chart,” Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst at the news site, said in a statement.
"People say they've already been tall; it's true.
But it could have been more, especially among suburban women voters and younger voters, ages 18 to 29, who often don’t vote until they like the president.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony detailing his sexual assault claims against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that a negative response could occur if Republicans pressed for confirmation.
“This has become a mess for the GOP,” said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the board vote or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh sits in the dock. It’s also about how Republicans have handled this issue and how they’ve treated her,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be divided between those who believe in Ford's stele and Kavanaugh's witnesses, with the balance shifting slightly to the latter.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents unquestionably or likely believe Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent say they unquestionably or likely believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh had probably or undoubtedly lied during his testimony, while 30 percent said the same of Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating claims filed by Ford and at least one other whistleblower, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh had assaulted him under the influence of alcohol when he was 17.
Ramirez alleges that the Supreme Court nominee showed her genitals at a party while they were studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the web is launching a new company that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that is based on Berners-Lee’s Solid open source platform.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people can access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's hidden intent was "to dominate the world".
"We have to do it now," he said of the emerging company.
“This is a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid platform technology to allow users to create their own “personal online data store” or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify. They're all available in one browser at a time.
What is exclusive to the personal online data store is that the user is the one who decides who can access certain information.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through data.”
Inrupt’s idea, according to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, is for the company to integrate the right resources, processes and skills so that the Solid platform is available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, a number of developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that none of his team is talking to “Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a radical change where all business models are completely empty overnight.
“We’re not asking for permission.”
In a Saturday post on Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s “mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web integrated into the Solid platform.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate about net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the clergy of the Victoria Cross of the I GM
The only clergyman in the Church of England to win a Victoria Cross during World War I as a combatant has been honoured in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant-Colonel and reverend Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was shot by a sniper four days later and never knew that he had won the most important British military honour.
His two grandchildren unveiled a memorial stone at a parade on Saturday in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "magnificently symbolic" that the gravestone would be unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning feat.
According to The London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a very thick fog and under intense cannon and machine gun fire".
He later ran towards the line of fire and, with "maximum bravery" advanced the line before throwing himself on a cannon with one hand and stunned three members of the detachment.
The lieutenant colonel was shot by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just one month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann (72) said that his grandfather's actions were a feat he could never match, which produces a sense of humility.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also left a crown after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was honored to be part of the parade and added that the courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the support he will receive from many people.
MMA fans who went without sleep all night to see Bellator 206, saw Peppa Pig instead
Imagine staying up all night to see Bellator 206 and being denied the most important event.
The San Jose poster contained 13 fights, including six from the main card and was to be seen live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the showdown, viewers in the United Kingdom were stunned when the lineup switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were disgusted to have spent the night awake until dawn to watch the fight.
A follower on Twitter described the switch to cartoons as "a kind of vomity joke".
“Government regulations say that at 6:00 this content is not appropriate, so they switched to children’s programming,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig, yes."
Bellator chairman Scott Coker said they would work on programming to include UK viewers in the future.
“I think when I think about repetition, I think it can work,” Coker said.
“But it’s six o’clock on a Sunday morning and we won’t be able to solve it until Sunday at our own time, Monday at yours.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when I switched channels, there were a lot of messages coming and going, and not all of them were pleasant.
We tried to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't like that. It was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen again.
We will leave it in five fights, instead of six as we normally do. We tried to show it again to the fans, but it was over.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" about sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley claims to have grown up feeling inferior to other people because of his sexuality, but that this provided him with the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize until he went to high school that not everyone was like him.
On Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he talked about gay rights to give "hope" to other people.
He also said that being a father had diminished his importance in winning the Olympics.
The regular host of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off due to illness.
Daley, who appeared as a castaway on Laverne's first show, said he felt "less than" the others because "it was not socially acceptable as boys and girls".
“To this day, those feelings of inferiority and difference have been real things that have given me the power and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that it was "something", he said, so as not to disappoint anyone when his sexuality was finally discovered.
The two-time Olympic bronze medal winner has become a high-profile promoter of the LGBT movement and has used his image at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he had spoken because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without ramifications and that he wanted to give "hope" to other people.
The three-time world champion explained that he had fallen in love with a man, the American filmmaker, Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, "took me by surprise".
Last year, Daley married the Oscar winner, 20 years his senior, but he says the age difference has never been an issue.
According to him, when you go through so much when you’re young (he participated in his first Olympics when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later), it’s hard to find someone the same age who has experienced similar highs and lows.
The couple were parents in June of a child whom they named Robert Ray Black-Daley. According to Daley, "their whole perspective" has changed.
"If you had asked me last year, all I needed was to win an Olympic gold," he said.
“There are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
Her son is named after her father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
According to Daley, his father did not accept that he had to die and one of the last things he asked was if they already had the tickets for London 2012, because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him 'dad, you won't be there to take the front row,'" she said.
“As I held his hand, he stopped breathing and it wasn’t until then, he was already dead, that I finally accepted that he wasn’t invincible,” she said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew that was what I had dreamed of all my life: jumping in front of a crowd at home in an Olympic Games. There was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired the choice of her first song (Proud by Heather Small), which she had heard during the preparation for the Olympics and which still gave her the goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs airs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Worsened Mickelson showed up for the Ryder Cup on Saturday
Phil Mickelson will set a record Sunday for his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to change his physical condition if he doesn’t want to become an unhappy milestone.
Mickelson, who will participate in the biennial event to break a record for the 12th time, was introduced by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday’s fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as has been usual for the United States, the winner of five major tournaments divides his time between acting as an animator and working on his game on the field, hoping to rectify what hurts him.
He has never made the most direct drivers, not even at the peak of his career, but the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the difficult trajectory of Le Golf National, where the long rough tends to punish the deflected blows.
And if his own trajectory isn’t discouraging enough, Mickelson, in Game 9 on Sunday, will face precise British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of this week’s games.
If the Americans, four points down at the start of the 12 individual games, start strong, Mickelson’s game could become absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in this man, without being able to say much more.
“He fully understood his role for that day, patted me on the back and wrapped his arm around me as he told me he would be ready the next day,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
It is a hall of fame and has contributed a lot to these teams before and this week.
I probably didn’t imagine him playing two games.
I imagined more, but that’s how I trained and that’s how we thought we had to move forward.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo’s record for the most Ryder Cup games played.
It can mean the end of a Ryder Cup race that has not matched your individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 draws, though Furyk has said his presence has brought intangibles to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, a joker, he likes to make fun of people and he’s a great teammate for the team,” he said.
“I think the younger players were also having fun messing with him this week, which has been fun to watch.
He brings so much more to his game.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows the advantage may soon fade
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that starting with a considerable advantage in the individual duels of the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a hard day.
The Dane made his debut in 1997 at Valderrama, when the team captained by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the American team, but in the end they achieved the victory by the minimum, 14.5-13.5.
"You keep remembering that we had a big advantage in Valderrama; we had a big advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but by a little," Bjorn said, in the image, after seeing the victory of the 2018 team by 5-3 both Friday and yesterday, which leaves the score at 10-6 in Le Golf National.
“History has taught me and all the team members that it’s not over yet.
Tomorrow we have to go to the car.
You have to go out and do everything right.
This doesn't end until the points go up in the scoreboard.
We have a goal, to try to win the trophy, and we have to stay focused to do that.
I’ve already said it, I focus on the 12 players we have in the team, but I also have in mind who our rivals are: the best players in the world.”
Delighted with his players’ performance on a demanding golf course, Bjorn added: “I will never rush with this.
Tomorrow will be different.
Tomorrow individual performance will make a difference and change everything.
It’s great to be there with a teammate when everything’s going well, but individual duels put your golfing skills to the ultimate test.
This is the message you have to convey to the players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
In that moment, you leave your partner and he has to go out and get the best out of himself too.”
In opposition to Bjorn, rival captain Jim Furyk expects his players to perform better individually than as a team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points out of four.
Furyk knows both sides of the coin about the last day's comebacks, as he was part of the winning team at Brookline before ending up losing in the "Miracle of Medinah" which won Europe.
“I remember exactly all the words,” he answered when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, had motivated his players before the final day.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but we want to start on a good footing, as we saw in Brookline and Medinah.
When there is a team that is inspired, a lot of pressure is generated in these central duels.
We have prepared the line-up according to the circumstances and the best way to try to do magic tomorrow.”
Thomas is challenged to try to start the comeback against Rory McIlroy in the main duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other Europeans in the first half of the order.
“I chose this order because I think it covers all possibilities,” Bjorn says of his selection for the individual bouts.
Germany's New Warship Delayed Again
The new German Navy frigate should have been completed in 2014 to replace the old warships of the Cold War era, but it will not do so, at least until next year as a result of faulty systems and an increase in cost, according to local media.
The completion of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the new Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quotes a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but post-construction problems have set the timelines for this ambitious project.
The four Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ships commissioned by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
It is believed to include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as anti-stealth technology such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other highlights include longer periods between maintenance: it should be possible to use the new frigates for up to two years without going through domestic ports.
However, these continuous delays imply that the avant-garde ships, which were predicted to be able to project into Germany as a powerful force abroad, will already be obsolete when they come into operation, according to Die Zeit.
The ill-fated F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy rejected the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the builder once delivered.
Few details are known about the reasons for its return, but German media have cited several "material and technical defects" of the ship that rendered it unusable if used in combat missions.
Technical problems are significant, as approximately 120 sailors, half of the crew needed for the former Bremen-class frigates, operate on Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ships.
In addition, it has also been known that the ship's weight is excessive, which reduces performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future improvements.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to weigh twice as much as similar-class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Aside from faulty materials, the cost of the project, which includes crew training, is also beginning to pose a problem.
It is believed to have reached a staggering €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) from an initial budget of €2.2 billion.
The problems of the new frigates have become a matter of special importance, taking into account recent warnings that Germany's maritime military power is weakening.
This year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the Navy "is running out of ships that can be used".
The official said the situation has worsened over time because the old ships were stopped from being used, but none were provided again as spares.
He lamented that none of the frigates of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Foundation spies on the secret life of bats
New research on a farm in the Scottish Highlands aims to discover how bats use the landscape for food.
The findings are expected to provide new insights into the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help in future conservation activities.
The study by scientists from the National Foundation of Scotland will follow soprano and common bats as well as northern eared and water bats in the Inverewe Botanic Garden, located in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations on the property to keep track of bat activities during the station.
Volunteers and staff from the UK’s National Health Service will also conduct mobile surveys with wearable detectors.
The sound analysis of the recordings by experts will determine the sound frequency of bats and what each species does.
With this information, a report and habitat map will be created to create a detailed landscape-scale image of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a natural conservation adviser at the Scottish National Foundation, hopes the results will show which habitat areas are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as grassland creation, and how to improve forest maintenance for bats and other associated species.
The bat population in Scotland and the rest of the UK has declined considerably in the last century.
The construction and restoration of buildings threaten bats, as they affect nests and can cause habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting also pose a risk, as do flypaper and chemical treatments used in building materials, as well as domestic cat attacks.
Bats aren't actually blind.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when they have to catch prey.
They use a sophisticated echo-location technique to locate insects and obstacles that get in the way of their flight.
The National Foundation of Scotland, responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who carry out surveys, inspections of nests and sometimes rescues on a regular basis.
The organisation has even created Scotland’s first and only bat reserve on the Threave Estate, located in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
The administrator of the estate, David Thompson, states that it is the ideal territory for the species.
“Here at Threate, we have a great area for bats,” he says.
“We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and a good habitat.
But we still don’t know many aspects of bats, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us better understand what they need to grow.”
It stresses the importance of checking whether there are bats before doing maintenance tasks on properties, since it may be that the possible involuntary destruction of a single maternity nest kills more than 400 females and young, which could lead to the disappearance of an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, attack them, disturb them and destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an officer with the Scottish Bat Conservation Foundation, has encouraged people to take a step forward to help.
“We still have a lot to learn from bats, and in the case of some of our species, we don’t have enough data on their population.”
Ronaldo denies rape allegations as his lawyers prepare a lawsuit against a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has said the rape allegations against him are "fake news" and said people "want to be famous" because of his name.
His lawyers will sue the German weekly magazine Der Spiegel, which is responsible for publishing the allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus striker has been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Allegedly, he paid $375,000 at the time for the incident not to be made public, according to information published Friday by Der Spiegel.
In an Instagram Live video addressing his 142 million followers hours after the allegations were made public, Ronaldo, 33, said they were "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news,” the five-time Ballon d’Or winner said on camera.
"They want to be famous because of my name.
It's normal.
They want to take advantage of my name to become famous, but it's part of my job.
I'm a happy man and everything is in order," the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are already preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have called "inadmissible information of suspicions about private life," according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player will seek compensation for “moral damages for an amount corresponding to the gravity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most flagrant infringements of personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms hotel and casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to reports filed in Clark County District Court in Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo knelt down after the alleged incident and told him he was a "99% good guy", except for a "1%".
The documents claim Ronaldo confirmed that both had sex, but were consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and was taken photographs of the injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "afraid of reprisals" and worried "about being publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman says she is seeking to cancel the deal as she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to sign for Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged incident and this summer has signed for Juventus, the Italian giant, in an operation of 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK 'would always regret' losing carmakers
The UK would “always regret it” if it lost the status of world leader in manufacturing after Brexit, according to Greg Clark, Secretary for Economic Affairs.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota's UK base had told the BBC that if the UK left the European Union without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at the plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese manufacturer has indicated that the impact of delays at the borders in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cause job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which makes Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models, produced 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My view is that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal by the end of March, production at our factory will stop,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s managing director at Burnaston.
Leaving the EU without any agreement on how trade with the rest of the EU countries will work has aroused fears from other UK carmakers, such as Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close the Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what manufacturers consider risks in the production chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is made on a “just-in-time” basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the European Union for the manufacture of automobiles.
If the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without reaching an agreement on March 29, it is possible that there will be riots at the border, which the sector believes could generate delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep inventory for more than a day at the Derbyshire plant, according to the company, and production would have to be halted as a result.
Clark claims that Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid these border controls".
"We have to come to an agreement. We want to get the best deal that allows us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
“Tests from not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers, indicate that we need to be able to continue with a successful set of production chains.”
Toyota has not been able to confirm how long production would stop, but in the long term, it has warned that the added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and could cause the loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite the Union coordinator at the plant, said members are starting to be very concerned about the situation: “From experience, when these jobs are lost, they never come back.”
A government spokesman said: “We have designed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.
According to the White House, the meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be delayed again
Donald Trump’s long-awaited meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “postponed for a week” as the fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, White House officials said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, links between Russia and Trump aid and a possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump fires the deputy attorney general and puts Mueller’s independence at risk has stoked rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and also the possibility of deposing the president with the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the claim.
But last Monday he went to the White House amid rumors that he was about to resign.
However, a meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump has said he would “prefer not” to fire Rosenstein, but postponed the meeting to avoid a showdown with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing that Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified to.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate-wide vote.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied the following: "No date has yet been set, it could be this week, although it may be delayed one more week for all matters with the supreme court.
But we'll see. I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists may refute this claim: Sanders has not held a White House briefing since September 10.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders responded that the lack of briefings was not because he disliked the bragging of television journalists, although he said, "I won't deny that they're braggarts."
He then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
“The president does more question-and-answer sessions than any previous president,” he said, before adding the following without citing any source: “We have consulted this data.”
Sanders said the briefings would continue to take place, but "if the press has the ability to ask the president of the United States directly, it's infinitely better than talking to me.
We try to do it often, you’ve seen us do a lot in the last few weeks and they will replace the briefings when you can talk to the president of the United States.”
Trump answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Individual press conferences are rare.
This week, in New York, the president has perhaps shown why, after an informal and, at times, strange appearance before the assembled journalists.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers of Scottish National Health Service in wake of Brexit fears
The Health Secretary has written to EU staff working in the Scottish National Health Service to express the country’s gratitude and wishes them to continue there after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the United Kingdom's departure from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to covering the cost of state of residence applications for EU citizens working in delegated public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote the following: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the exit have continued, and everything seems to be heading towards the decisions expected this autumn.
But the UK government has also begun preparations in the event of a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this is a difficult time for all of you.
For this reason, I would like to reiterate now that I greatly appreciate the contribution of all staff members, regardless of their nationality.
Our colleagues in the EU, and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and enhance the work of the health service, while benefiting patients and the communities we treat.
Of course, Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Christion Abercrombie of the Tennessee State Tigers has undergone emergency surgery after suffering a head injury Saturday in a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, according to Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed said the injury occurred shortly before halftime.
“He came to the sideline and collapsed there,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen to the band before placing him on a bunk bed and taking him away for further testing.
A Tennessee State official has informed Chris Harris, of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no information on the type or extent of the injury" and Tennessee State is investigating when the injury occurred.
It is Abercrombie's first season, as a sophomore, with Tennessee State after joining from Illinois.
He had completed five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, making a total of 18 this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp duty when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp duty when buying a property in the UK with the additional money used to help the homeless under the Conservative Party’s new plans.
This action will neutralize the success of the Corbyn movement to attract young voters.
The increase in stamp duty will be taxed on those who do not pay tax in the UK.
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers are expected to be taxed a higher stamp duty when buying a property in the UK and this money will be used to help the homeless, a move Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's movement to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing that would affect higher incomes.
The increase in stamp duty will be levied on those individuals and businesses who do not pay tax in the UK; this money will go towards government action to combat the numbers of the homeless.
The surcharge, which will be added to the current stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago in second homes and real estate speculation, could be up to 3%.
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of London’s newly built properties are from non-British residents, which raises prices and makes it difficult for new buyers to make their way up the property ladder.
Many affluent areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost towns" as a result of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new measure comes weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the stamp tax to help young people have their first home.
He accused the big constructs of keeping property prices high by buying land quickly and not using it, and urged May to cancel quotas on affordable homes to correct Britain's "real estate disaster".
Corbyn has announced a number of attractive proposed real estate reforms, such as checks on rent and ending evictions "without fault".
He also wants to give more power to city councils to build new homes.
May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream: life must improve for every new generation.
And that means fixing our broken real estate market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and create a life here.
However, it may not be right for it to be just as easy for people not living in the UK, as well as for companies based abroad, to buy housing compared to hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home is too distant, and the indignity of the homeless makes it all the more real.”
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to coach Scotland"
Sunderland manager Jack Ross has said his "maximum ambition" is to be Scotland's coach at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot has accepted the challenge of reviving the northeastern club, which currently occupies third place in League One, three points behind the leader.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after returning St Mirren to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
I was called in once as a supporter and that's it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportssound programme.
“But I grew up watching a lot of Scotland playing in Hampden with my father when I was little and it’s always something that takes me back in time.
This opportunity will only come to me if I succeed in coaching clubs, though.”
Ross's predecessors as manager of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager says he does not feel pressure to be next on a list of names enshrined in such a large team, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“At the moment, my criterion for measuring my success will be whether I can bring this team back to the Premier League.
“With the structure and facilities of the club, it is clear that its place is in the Premier League,” he said.
“It’s not easy to get there, but I would only consider that I’ve been successful here if I can bring the club back.”
Ross has only three years of coaching experience, following a stint as a second coach at Dumbarton and 15 months in the Hearts coaching staff.
He helped Alloa avoid relegation to the third tier and transformed St Mirren from fighting for salvation to Championship champions the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than during his time at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was probably a decisive moment,” he recalled about accepting the position at Alloa.
“I always thought that training was the best thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds weird because I did it right, I got away with it reasonably well, and I enjoyed pretty good highs.
But playing can be hard.
There are a lot of things you have to overcome every week.
I’m still dealing with things like stress and pressure at work, but I feel good as a coach.
I’ve always wanted to train and now I’m doing it, it’s the most comfortable time I’ve felt since I was an adult.”

The perfect time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday, according to a study.
The summer heatwave has skyrocketed consumption in Britain’s struggling bars, but has added more pressure on restaurant chains.
Bars and bar chains saw a 2.7% increase in sales in July, but consumption in restaurants fell by 4.8%, according to statistics.
Peter Martin, CGA’s financial adviser, said: “The continued hours of sunshine and England’s participation in the World Cup, which has lengthened more than expected, have meant that July follows a similar pattern to June, with the increase of 2.8% in bars, except in the case of restaurants, which has been reduced to a minimum.
The 1.8% reduction in consumption in June restaurants has worsened in July.
Bars and taverns, led by the consumption of drinks, have obtained the best results, while the consumption in restaurants has gone down.
The bars that offer food have also suffered from the sun, although it has not been as dramatic as in the case of restaurants.
People just wanted to go out and drink.
In the bars and taverns we consulted, beverage sales increased by 6.6% during the month, while food sales fell by 3%.
Paul Newman, from RSM leisure and hospitality analysts, said: “These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Time and the impact of large social or sporting events remain the main factors related to the sales of the external leisure market.
It’s no surprise that restaurants continue to struggle, but a 4.8% year-on-year decline in sales would be especially damaging, rather than continued cost pressure.
“This long, hot summer couldn’t have come at a worse time for food-serving retailers and time will tell if the more moderate temperatures we’ve had in August will provide that much-needed respite.”
The total increase in sales of bars and restaurants, including those recently opened, was 2.7% in July, data indicating the slowdown in the presentation of brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker sales indicator for restaurants, bars and taverns in the United Kingdom collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operator groups, with a combined loss of more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 million and is the established benchmark in the sector.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that hide from parents
One in five children, some as young as 11, have secret social media accounts that hide from parents and teachers, according to a survey.
A survey of 20,000 high school students has indicated an increase in "fake Insta" pages
The news has raised fears about the publication of sexual content
20% of students say they have a “principal” account that they show to parents
One in five children, some as young as 11, create social media accounts that hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students has indicated a rapid rise in “fake Insta” accounts, a reference to Instagram, the photo-sharing site.
The news has raised fears about the publication of sexual content.
20% of students say they have a net “principal” account that they show to parents, while they also have a private one.
A mother who discovered her 13-year-old daughter’s secret account saw a message from a teenage girl urging others to “rape me.”
The research, carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the Independent Schools Private Principals Committee (HMC), revealed that 40% of teenagers aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, half of whom have admitted to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: “It’s disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" in the Scottish Athletics Federation's directive
Eilidh Doyle has been appointed non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Federation’s board of directors at the organisation’s annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland’s most medal-winning track and field athlete and President Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from his extensive experience at an international level over the past decade.
“Eilidh has the respect of the athletics community in Scotland, the UK and around the world and we are confident that Scottish athletics will benefit from their incorporation into the leadership,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am very much looking forward to acting as the voice of the athletes and I hope to be able to grow the sport and contribute to Scotland."
The American, who won gold in the 200 and 400 at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, among a total of four Olympic golds and is currently a regular commentator for the BBC, was prevented from walking after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me that only time will tell if I can recover or to what degree.
It has been exhausting, but I have recovered completely, I have learned to walk again and today it is time to do agility exercises!
Thanks for the messages of encouragement!”
A cartoon ad comparing mothers to cows divides opinion on the Internet
A strapping company has split opinion on the Internet with an ad comparing nursing mothers to milking cows.
To mark the launch of what is considered the “world’s first silent shoulder strap,” consumer technology company Elvie has aired an ad inspired by a prank music video to showcase the freedom the new shoulder strap gives moms.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of fodder and cows to the rhythm of a song that includes lyrics such as: "Yes, I move myself, but you will not see any tail" and "In case you hadn't noticed, they are not panties, but my breasts".
The comeback continues: "Bomb, pump, feed the babies, pump, pump, pump the girls."
However, the announcement, posted on the company's Facebook page, has caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received a mixture of reactions from those who have seen it, many of whom claim that it shows the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
"Very bad decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they must get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, with the difference that they are separated from their babies a few days after giving birth," one person wrote.

Another person commented: "Comprehensibly traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But why not use them to advertise a turban for mothers who will keep their babies?"
Another user added, “It’s an out-of-place ad.”
Other people defended the ad; one woman admitted finding the song "fun".
“I think it’s a great idea.
I would buy one if I had to breastfeed.
Pumping for the shoulder strap made me feel exactly like a cow.
The announcement is a bit crazy, but it has to be taken for what it is.
It's a great product," one user wrote.
Another person commented, "It's a fun ad for moms who pump with braces (usually at their workplace or in the bathroom and feel like they're cows.
It’s not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the women show that they have all danced with the strap tucked discreetly into the bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the perception that many women say they feel as if they are cows when they use the suspender.
However, the Elvie strap is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and discreetly fits into a nursing bra, giving women more freedom to move, hold babies, and even get out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, a partner and early childhood developer at Mother, said: “The Elvie shoulder strap is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative campaign.
In drawing the parallel between women and cows, we wanted to show the public how to use a tie and the challenges involved in doing so, while demonstrating, in an entertaining and didactic way, the incredible feeling of freedom offered by the new tie.
This isn’t the first time Ellie has been in the news.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the runway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Silently Moved to a Tent Camp on the Texas Border
The number of detained migrant children has increased even as monthly entries across the border have remained virtually stable, in part because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to sponsor children.
Traditionally, most godparents were undocumented immigrants, who have been afraid to risk their ability to stay in the country if they decide to take in a child.
The risk has increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adults living in their homes will have to send fingerprints, which will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high-ranking officer with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Service, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to house unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
“About 80 percent of the people who have hosted or live in the home of a person who has hosted are in the country illegally, and a large majority of them are criminal aliens.
Therefore, we will continue to persecute these people,” Albence said.
To prosecute children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that require some to report to court within a month of being detained, rather than 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to shelter workers.
Many of them will appear by videoconference, rather than face-to-face, to defend their case to obtain legal status before an immigration judge.
All those deemed unfit for assistance will be immediately deported.
The more time children spend in custody, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can generate violent rampages or escape attempts, according to workers and reports the system has unveiled in recent months.
Lawyers say these concerns can be intensified in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where signs that a child is suffering are more likely to be overlooked because of their size.
They added that moving children to camp without having time to prepare them emotionally or say goodbye to friends can cause them a trauma that many already suffer.
Syria urges U.S., French and Turkish ‘occupation forces’ to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the war in the country has been going on for eight years.
Muallem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said the foreign forces were on Syrian territory illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "the matter will be dealt with accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Muallem insisted that the “war on terror is practically over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and the conflict has caused millions of displaced people.
He said Damascus would continue “fighting this sacred battle until we have purged the entire Syrian territory” of both terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly to train and advise Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in a war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Muallem said conditions were good for their return and blamed "some Western countries" for spreading "irrational fears" that make refugees want to stay away.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They are politicizing an issue that should be purely humanitarian.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats have said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a neutral zone in the last major rebel stronghold, Idlib, has favored the opportunity to continue political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a full-scale attack by Syrian forces with Russian help in the province, where three million people live.
However, Muallem noted that the agreement has "clear ends" and expressed hope that military action will confront the jihadists, which include Al-Nusra Front fighters linked to Al-Qaeda, who "will be eradicated".
Staffan de Mistura, a U.N. envoy, hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee made up of members of the government and opposition to begin shaping a post-war constitution and paving the way for elections.
Muallem outlined the conditions of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, whose task should be restricted to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warned of possible interference.
Why Trump will win for the second time
According to this logic, Trump would win the election again in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers probably expect, the scandals and the impeachment process end his presidency prematurely.
It would be, without a doubt, “the end of a most dramatic presidency in history.”
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue in the spectators.
Since 2014, the number of prime-time viewers has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” has led cable TV audiences with up to 3.5 million viewers on major information nights.
“People have been thrown into it because they don’t understand it,” says Neal Baer, executive producer of the ABC series “Designated Survivor,” about a cabinet decree that happens to be the president when an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has another theory.
Remember a taxi ride to Boston before the 2016 election?
The taxi driver told him he would vote for Trump.
“Why?” he asked.
“He told me that because it made him laugh,” Scovell told me.
There is an entertainment point in the chaos.
Of course, unlike television shows, the script coming out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families will be able to come together, and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
And yet, to be an informed citizen is to go further when you are in the sixth hour of seeing a group of experts debate Bob Woodward’s use of sources “for private use” for his book “Fear,” the 15,000-dollar ostrich-skin jacket of Paul Manafort’s “Washington Post” (“a piece of thick cloth” with his “Washington Post”).
In my case, I will never look the same as Super Mario again.
“Part of what makes it feel like it’s part of a reality show is that every night it gives you something new,” says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars” about the character changes and script twists of Trump’s show.
You can't afford to miss an episode because you're left behind.
When I saw Fleiss this week, there was a temperature of about 25 degrees and it was sunny outside the house he has on the north coast of Kauai, but he stayed locked up watching MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
It couldn't be undone, not with Brett Kavanaugh about to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging by a thread.
“I remember when we were doing those crazy shows back then and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it would be a kind of joke, but it seems they were right.”

External money floods the races of the midterm elections to the tightest House of Representatives
It is no surprise that there is a flood of cash in Pennsylvania’s 17th district, thanks to the realignment of congressional districts that has forced two current members to compete for the same square.
This recent reassignment of the suburban district of Pittsburg involves Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb, who won the seat in another district after a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th District of Pennsylvania, which comes into conflict with the new 17th District.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the former districts were unconstitutionally divided in favor of the Republicans.
The race for the new 17th district has triggered a financial war between the parties’ main financial organizations, the Democratic Campaign Committee for Congress (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb made a name for himself in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a widely followed special election held in March to represent Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
Republicans have held office for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political pundits give Democrats a slight edge.
U.S. imposes sanctions on El Salvador for its support of China, but removes them
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Trump held a tense meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Valera in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his partners ousted the Trump Organization’s management team.
State Department officials decided to remove heads of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over “recent decisions on whether to stop recognizing Taiwan,” department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said this month.
However, only the possibility of sanctioning El Salvador, which received in 2017 aid from the United States of 140 million dollars, according to estimates, for the control of drug trafficking, development and economic improvements, was considered.
The proposed sanctions, which include cuts in financial aid and restrictions on visas issued, would be detrimental to the Central American country and the high death toll from murder and unemployment.
As internal meetings progressed, officials from both countries postponed a high-level meeting focused on security and economic prosperity to continue a similar meeting held last year that was seen as a step forward in preventing migrants from heading to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials had clarified that they wanted the meeting to take place, effectively ending any likelihood of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has been chosen for the meeting, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to it, according to diplomats.
The three U.S. envoys quietly returned to their posts in El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
A Bolton White House spokesman declined to comment on details of the debate described by the three officials, who include two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations on condition of anonymity.
An external analyst, close to the administration and also from the anonymity, corroborated the statements.
Study History
The next event to occur could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, of which there is ample evidence on public records.
As far as is known, Mueller is also investigating whether the Trump campaign collaborated with Russia in its attack on the election.
If Congress changes hands, Trump could find himself accountable to the body, just as he prepares to do so in front of voters, and even before a jury of party members.
There are many circumstantial conditions, and I do not want to suggest that the fall of Trump, or any of his European namesakes, is inevitable.
There are decisions to be made on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the situation will last.
In 1938, German officials were willing to stage a coup against Hitler, only if the Western Bloc had resisted him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid all the years of terror that followed.
The course of history fluctuates over turning points like this and the inexorable progress of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
The United States is currently facing several turning points.
What if Trump fired Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, the man who controls the fate of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been neck and neck since that newspaper reported that, last year, he suggested secretly recording the president and speculated that he was not suitable for the job.
Rosenstein claims that the Times's information is inaccurate.
“How will we respond if the new investigation the FBI has requested on Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if it is upheld by the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and false witness testimony?
And, especially, will we vote in the middle of the legislature for a Congress that will make Trump responsible for it?
If we do not pass these tests, democracy will begin to be in danger.
But I don’t think we will fail, because I already learned my lesson in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jewess deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that occupied the ambassador’s house.
He survived, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles at that table with the swastika.
With this background, how can I not be optimistic about the future?”

Rangers’ Graham Dorrans is optimistic about the match against Rapid Wien
Rangers host the Vienna Rapids on Thursday, aware that a win against the Austrians, after an impressive draw at Vila-real this month, would leave them in a good position to qualify for the Europa League Group G.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from playing the first few minutes of the season until the 2–2 draw against Vila-real, but he believes Rangers can use this result as a springboard for great results.
“It was a positive point for us, because Vila-real is a good team,” said the 31-year-old.
“We played the game believing we could get a valuable result and we came out with a point.
Maybe we could have pulled off something more in the end, but overall, the tie was probably a fair result.
They were better in the first half, but we were better in the second.
On Thursday, it was another big night.
We hope to be able to keep the three points, but it will be a difficult match because they got a good result in the last game, but I am sure we will give it our all and we will get a good result with the support of the fans.
“Last year was really tough, with the injuries I suffered and the changes at the club, but now it’s a good place to be.
The team is good and the guys enjoy it, the trainings are good.
I hope we can give it our all, leave last season behind and be successful.”
Women Lose Sleep for Fear of Retirement Savings
Although the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people talked about it with their family.
Approximately half of respondents nationwide say they have spoken with their partner about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent of respondents said they had talked to their children.
“People want family members to take care of them, but they don’t dare to ask,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance company Nationwide.
We have to start from here.
Talk to your partner and your children: you can not prepare your family to take care of you if you do not communicate your wishes in advance.
Work with your counsellor and family to decide where and how to receive care, as these decisions can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Include your financial advisor in the conversation: it can also help you determine how to pay for these expenses.
Your financing options for your long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash-value hybrid life insurance policy that helps you cover expenses, or your own insurance with your own resources, if you have the money to do so.
Prepare your legal documents: cut through the legal battles.
Look for a representative to be able to appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical care and make sure the professionals fulfill your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Consider also the possibility of contracting a notarial power of attorney for your finances.
It is advisable to select a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid in the event of incapacity.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly relative has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Specify these details in a written plan to be ready.
Finances are not the only factor to be determined, but also with which doctors you want to treat, "said Martin.
“What are the medications?
Who will take care of the dog?
Have this plan prepared.”
Man shot several times with a compressed air shotgun in Ilfracombe

The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
"Officers described the shooting, which occurred at around 2.30am (on British summer time), as a 'random act'.
The victim did not see the attacker.
His life is not in danger from the injuries and the police have called to find witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a strong earthquake and tsunami that shook the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to authorities. The death toll is expected to rise.
As communications are cut off, the relief units have been unable to obtain information from the Donggala regency, an area north of Palu closest to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated since the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Celebs:
Palu is the capital of Celebes Central Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Celebes Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
Donggala is a regency that stretches along more than 300 km of coastline northwest of Celebes Island.
The regency, a lower administrative region than a province, had a population of approximately 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the mainstays of the economy of the Central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is concentrated mainly in Morowali, on the coast at the other end of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have suffered several tsunamis in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia’s disaster mitigation agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996, a tsunami struck west of Donggala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, and earthquakes occur there with some frequency.
Listed below are the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004 – On 26 December, a major earthquake off the west coast of the Indonesian province of Ace, north of Sumatra, triggered a tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people off the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Thousands of people died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that devastated the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 shook an area aft of the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 shook one of the islands of Mentawai, off the coast of Sumatra, and caused a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake affected the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh and caused destruction and panic, as the population recalled the devastation of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people were killed by the buildings that fell.
2018: A series of large earthquakes occurred on the tourist Indonesian island of Lombok that killed over 500 people, mainly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily trapped.
Sarah Palin's Son Arrested on Domestic Violence Charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on assault charges.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report published Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, she pulled out her phone.
Palin is being held at the Mat-Su Provisional Detention Center, where he is being held with an unsecured $500 bond, according to KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, when he pleaded "not guilty, for sure" when asked how he was pleading, according to the network.
Palin faces three Class A fouls, meaning he could face up to a year in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also charged with a class B misdemeanor, which can be punished with one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently in the hands of the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic assault, interfering with the reporting of a domestic violence crime and possession of a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His wife said he punched her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups for associating her son's violent behavior with post-traumatic stress disorder stemming from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake shook the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks do not work and the number of deaths is expected to increase over the next few days.
The quake struck just off the coast of Central Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
Videos are circulated on social media with the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal Prosecutors Seek Exceptional Death Penalty for Suspect in New York Terrorist Attack
New York federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York terror attack that killed eight people: an extraordinary penalty that has not been applied to the state for a federal offense since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike lane on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan and run over pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims “intentionally” and that he “intentionally” caused serious personal injury, in accordance with the notice of intent to seek the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both crimes could carry the death penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury attacked Saipov with a 22-count indictment that included eight counts of murder for the benefit of organized crime, which federal prosecutors typically use in mafia cases, in addition to a crime of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
Prosecutors said the attack required "considerable planning and premeditation" and described Saipov's actions as "inhuman, cruel and depraved".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been a decade since the last time the Southern District of New York brought a death penalty case to trial.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of conspiracy to conduct espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs died in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no regrets in the days and months following the attack.
Police said they told investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
According to police, he also requested that the ISIS flag be unfurled in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 misdemeanor counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, rather than accepting a guilty plea and a life sentence with no possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved,” Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be put in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to “mobilize popular troops” today during a protest at the Conservative Party conference.
The former UKIP leader has said politicians should "feel the pressure of Eurosceptics" when one of Theresa May's own members of parliament has suggested she should lead negotiations with the EU.
Unelected Conservative MP Peter Bone told the march in Birmingham that the UK would already be out of the EU if Mr Farage were the Brexit secretary.
But the challenge Mrs May faces in reconciling her deeply divided ranks has been highlighted when pro-union Conservatives have turned up at another Brexit protest in the City.
The prime minister is struggling to preserve her Chequers compromise plan between attacks by Brexiteers, unionists and the EU.
The allies insist that it will manage to reach an agreement with Brussels despite negative responses and pressure eurosceptics and the conservative party to choose between its package and chaos.
Mr. Bone told the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to undo Chequers' commitment.
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been appointed a member of the House of Lords and that he should have been given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had been in charge, we would have been out,” he said.
MP Wellingborough added: "I will defend Brexit, but we have to undo the Chequers compromise".
To clarify his opposition to the EU, he added: "We did not fight world wars to be servile.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is totally false".
Conservative Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns also attended the march and told reporters: "I just tell you, Prime Minister, listen to the people."
“The commitment of Chequers is unpopular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular within our party and our activists, who are the people who take to the streets and get us to win an election.
Give up the Chequers pledge and start listening."
In a message to Mrs May, he added: "Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises".
Mr Farage said the politicians at the rally must feel the pressure if they want to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
“This, now, is a matter of trust between us (the people) and our political class,” he said.
“They are trying to betray Brexit and today we are here to tell them that we will not allow them to do so.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make the political class, about to betray Brexit, feel the pressure.”
“We are mobilizing the popular troops of this country who gave us victory with Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, self-reliant and proud Britain.”
Meanwhile, supporters of the union marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small number of activists waved banners over the Conservatives against Brexit after the group’s launch this weekend.
The Conservative member of the House of Lords Lord Adonis laughed at the Conservatives for the security problems they suffered with an application of the party at the beginning of the conference.
“These are the people who are telling us that they can have the necessary IT systems and all the technology for the Canada plus plus deal, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It is a complete farce.
“There is no option for a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren is considering running for president as a candidate.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at an open meeting in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against GOP state representative Geoff Diehl, who was deputy chairman of Trump’s Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
He has been the center of speculation about the possibility of taking over Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with constituents with the meeting format open since Trump took office.
An aide asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for "women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes a woman at the top."
A person arrested for the shooting death of Sims, LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced Saturday that a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims has been arrested Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at the ET press conference at 11:00 a.m.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying the man in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and eventually killed," police officer Murphy J. Paul told 247Sports.com on Saturday.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to having been at the scene, in possession of a gun, and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton District Police Department.
Sims, a 2 m junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 starts during the last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton takes world title after team orders handed him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas was ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes team orders would play an important role in the race.
From pole position, Bottas had a good start and nearly exhausted Hamilton while defending his position in the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel pitted earlier and let Hamilton run with the traffic at the back of the package, which should have been decisive.
Later, Mercedes had to pit and come out behind Vettel, but Hamilton advanced after some wheel-to-wheel action that caused the Ferrari driver to leave the free inside with the risk of being left out after a double move to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen started on the last row of the grid and by the end of the first lap he was in seventh position on the day of his 21st birthday.
He then continued in good position much of the race as he retained his wheels to save time, overtaking Kimi Raikkonen and moving into fourth position.
He finally entered the pits on lap 44, but could not increase the pace over the next eight laps and Raikkonen placed fourth.
It’s a difficult day, because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and he was a real gentleman who was told to let me pass.
The team has done a fantastic job to have a one-two," Hamilton said.
His body language was terrible.
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Dianne Feinstein at a Saturday rally for insisting that she did not leak Christine Blasey Ford’s letter accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
At a rally in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly about Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate proved that people are "bad, cruel and lying."
“One thing that could happen and the most beautiful thing that is happening in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people angry, bad, cruel and lying,” he said.
“When you look at the press releases and the leaks and they say, ‘No, it wasn’t me.
It wasn't me."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you filter it?
Do you remember his answer... did you leak the document? "Hey, what?
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I didn't filter it."
Hey, wait a minute.
We filtered... No, we didn’t filter it,” she added while imitating the senator.
Feinstein received the letter detailing statements against Kavanaugh from Ford in July and leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s statements, I didn’t leak her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
"He asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential, just as he asked me."
But his denial didn’t please the President, who commented at Saturday night’s rally: “You know what? His body language was terrible.
Maybe he didn’t, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that Democrats were using the statements for their own ends.
"They are determined to regain power by the means necessary.
You see the evil, the cruelty, they don’t care who they hurt, who they run over to get power and control,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars repaired Friday's Elite loss to the Belfast Giants as they won the 5–3 return match at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had a two-goal lead thanks to Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie raised their team's level, but then Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard equalled the Dundee. Then, two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured his victory.
It was the third Elite League loss of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who had just won Dundee 2–1 in Belfast on Friday.
It was the fourth game of the season between the two teams and the Giants had won the previous three games.
The first goal came from Dwyer's hand in the fourth minute, at 3:35, assisted by Kendall McFaull. Four minutes later, assisted by David Rutherford, Beauvillier doubled his lead.
During this initial hectic period, Sullivan placed the home team back in the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt eased the equalizer at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead in the first half when he scored the second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped and, again, Bouchard contributed to their level with a powerful goal in the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time during the match at the end of the second half and secured his team's victory with the fifth goal near the end of the match.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, are home to Milton Keynes and have their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies to save hundreds of passengers from an earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller has become a hero after dying to make sure a plane with hundreds of passengers landed safely.
More than 800 people have died and many have disappeared after a major earthquake shook the island of Celebes on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Many replicas are occurring in the area and there are many people trapped among the ruins in the city of Palu.
But despite his comrades escaping to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to give up his place at the tremulous control tower of Palu Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He stayed in place to ensure that Batik Flight 6321, which was on the tarmac at the time, could take the flight safely.
Then he came out of the air traffic control tower when he thought he was sinking.
He died later in the hospital.
A representative of Air Navigation, Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“It broke my heart,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, while the disaster mitigation agency has reported that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The death toll is expected to rise because there are still many bodies under the rubble and there are still many that have not been accessed,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The waves, with a height of up to six meters, have devastated Palu, which will hold a common funeral on Sunday.
The armed forces and some commercial aircraft are bringing aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute, an ambulance carries corpses.
Drinking water is scarce.
All the mini-bars have been looted.”
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is working against the clock to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will find.
It’s a tragedy, but it could get worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the armed forces: “I ask you all to work day and night to complete all tasks related to the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” asked CNN.
Indonesia suffered another earthquake this year in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Aviation accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini says now that a man has disappeared after the accident in the lagoon
The airline operating a flight that will crash into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says one man has gone missing, although it previously said the 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that, since Saturday afternoon, they had not found a passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to try to find him.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew when the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at the Chuuk Islands airport.
Authorities said Friday that seven people had been taken to a hospital.
The airline said there were still six passengers at the hospital on Saturday and all were in good condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are still unknown.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy claimed that the plane moored in the lagoon because the runway fell short.
Some witnesses believe the plane missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes explained that the plane was going very low.
“That was extremely positive,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and other passengers managed to walk with water around their waists to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants panicked and started yelling, and that he suffered a mild head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors who had been working nearby to improve a pier also assisted in the rescue with an inflatable boat to transport the affected people to the ground before the plane sank about 30 meters (30 feet) into the water.
Aviation Safety Network data indicates that 111 people have died in PNG-registered airline accidents, but Air Niugini was not involved in any of these accidents.
An analyst composes a chronology of the night a woman was burned alive.
Prosecutors concluded the case Saturday in a review of the trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used mobile phone records to build the movements of the accused, 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, on the night he died.
Rowlett said he received location data from different mobile phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers the night he died, contradicting his previous statements, The Clarion Ledger reports.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford denied it and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he claimed he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he had lied, since his truck was in Nashville.
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed he had known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
The phone records indicated that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He erased her from her life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to pass at the hands of the jury throughout the same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio fills their music with positive messages to challenge the genre’s negative outlook.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip-hop has moved away from its origins with political messages and social problems.
They want to go back to their roots and put conscious hip-hop back into fashion.
Some artists, such as The Fugees and Common, have experienced a recent resurgence in the UK at the hands of artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
NY babysitter sues couple for dismissal after ‘racist’ message
A New York babysitter has sued a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misdirected text message from the mother protesting that she was “another black person.”
The couple deny that they are racists and compare the lawsuit with an “extortion”.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed dismay that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work on the first day in 2016.
“NOOOOOOOOOOOOO ANOTHER BLACK PERSON,” Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice, twice.
After realizing her piffle, an "uncomfortable" Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, claiming that the nanny she had fired, who was African-American, had done her job wrong and that she expected a Filipino person, according to the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice received her day’s pay and was then sent home with an Uber.
Now, Maurice claims the couple compensation for the layoff and asks for compensation of approximately $350 a day for the six-month residency job for which she had been hired, even though there was no contract.
“I want to show them that you can’t do things like that,” he told the Post on Friday, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple have responded to statements that they are racist by stating that Maurice's dismissal was the most reasonable, as they were afraid of not being able to trust her after having offended her.
"My wife sent him something she didn't want to say.
It's not racist.
We are not racist people,” her husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you’ve been rude to, even if it was by mistake?
A baby?
Let's go."
Plasco, who has compared the lawsuit to an "extortion," said his wife had two months left to have a baby and was in a "very difficult situation."
“Are you going to pursue something like that?
It’s not a very nice attitude,” added the investment banker.
The legal case has not yet been resolved and the court of public opinion has rushed to denounce the couple on social networks and to condemn their behavior and logic.
Paddington editors feared readers would not identify with a talking bear, according to a new letter.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who first reads it before it's published.
It’s very funny, now that we know what we know about Paddington’s great success.”
He explained that his father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he had the inspiration to write the children's book about a small teddy bear, was optimistic about the book's rejection. He also said that the 60th anniversary of the books' publication was "bittersweet", after his death last year.
He describes Paddington as a very important member of his family and says that his father was very proud of the success he had finally achieved.
"He was a discreet man; he was not a presumptuous one," she said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was practically like when your child achieves something: you pride yourself, even if it’s not your thing.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always used to recognise Paddington's own merit."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone
Upon landing, they rushed their daughter to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
“Nad would call frequently to say it was very serious and that they didn’t expect it to get over it,” Ednan-Laperouse said.
"Then I got a call from Nad and he said he was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, beautiful.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll go with you.
The medications he had been given to keep his body beating were being consumed and were coming out of his system.
He had died earlier than expected and it all went away.
I just had to sit back and wait because I knew what was going on.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by family and more people.
I had to keep up the good form.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the rest of the passengers, distracted by the experience she was going through.
“No one knew,” he said.
"He had his head held high and the tears kept falling.
It is difficult to explain, but during the flight I felt a feeling of sympathy for Nad overwhelming.
The feeling that I needed my love and my understanding.
I know I loved her very much.”
Mourning women hang cards to prevent suicides on a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide are working to prevent others from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been hanging cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that citizens can call for assistance.
Ms. Davis’ son, Tyler, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and, at the age of 18, he killed himself.
“I don’t want any father or mother to feel what I have to feel every day,” she said.
Ms Davis, 45, who resides in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
“Everybody knew him by his smile.
They always said that their smile could light up any room."
However, he quit his job before he died because he was in a "very dark spot."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found him after he had taken his own life.
Ms. Davis stated, “I am continually concerned that there is a side effect.”
Ms. Davis created the cards “so people know there are people they can turn to, they can listen to, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t be silent; you must speak.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, shortly after the death of Mark’s mother.
“He never said he wasn’t well or depressed or anything like that,” she said.
“A couple of days before Christmas we saw a change in attitude.
He hit rock bottom on Christmas Day, when the kids opened their presents and he didn't look them in the eye or anything."
He said that his death was a great trauma for them, but that they had to work on it: "It opens a hole in the family.
It destroys us.
We have to go on and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs by a thread as FBI begins investigation
“I thought that if we could get something like what he was asking for (an investigation with limited scope and time), we could get some unity,” Mr. Flake said Saturday. He also added that he feared the committee would be destroyed with the entrenched deadlock of supporters.
Why didn’t Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
His reluctance has to do with the moment.
There are only five weeks left until the November 6 midterm elections. If, as expected, the Republicans do not get good results, they will be weakened in getting the man they want elected to the main court of the country.
George W. Bush has been picking up the phone to call senators and pressure them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who has worked in the White House for Mr. Bush. He also met his wife Ashley through Mr. Bush, as she was his personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI creates its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice President, to undo the tie and confirm it in the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean defectors 'falls' with Kim
The number of defectors from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Southern Unification Ministry, said there had been 1,127 defections last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said tight border controls between North Korea and China and rising prices charged by human traffickers had been the main factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comment.
Normally, the vast majority of North Korean defectors are offered South Korean nationality.
Seoul sources claim that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape through China, which has a longer border with North Korea and is easier to create than the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers migrant deserters illegal, rather than refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks focused on stalled negotiations on denuclearization.
This came after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in general terms to work towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under these circumstances, we will not disarm first unilaterally,” Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is ‘hysterical’ and unfit to work in High Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said High Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh is a "hysterical" and that his temperament makes him unable to work on the High Court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t help but think that if a woman had acted in this way, they would have told her she is a ‘hysterical,’” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes screaming and speechless as he talked about his family and his years in high school.
He also explicitly condemned the committee's Democrats and said the allegations against him amounted to a "grotesque and coordinated assassination of a character" staged by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said Kavanaugh's testimony showed he could not work in the High Court because he was prejudiced against Democrats.
“I think he’s disqualified himself with these statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi was hesitant when asked if she would attempt to contest Kavanaugh's election, if it was confirmed, and if Democrats would win a majority in the House of Representatives.
“This is what I can say: if you don’t tell the truth in Congress or the FBI, you’re not only not fit to be in the High Court, but you’re not fit to be in the courtroom where you are now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh currently serves as a judge on the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about the decisions Kavanaugh might make against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, as she considers herself a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearings, he dodged questions about whether he would overturn certain High Court decisions.
“This is not the time for a hysterical and prejudiced person to come into the courtroom and hope it looks wonderful to us,” Pelosi said.
Women must exercise their power.
It is a justified diatribe: months and years of abundant fury and you cannot get it out without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's uncommon. How about you?"
She continued... "I was very helped by a woman who was an executive somewhere who told me that she also cried when she was angry, but that she developed a tactic that consisted of, when she was angry and started crying, saying to the person she was talking to, 'Maybe you think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then it continued.
I thought it was brilliant.”
Tears are allowed as an outlet for anger in part because, basically, they are misunderstood.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs in a male-majority office, where I once ended up crying with indescribable rage, is that of an older woman (a cool directive who had always terrified me a little) who grabbed me by the collarbone and dragged me to the eye of the ladder.
“Never let them see you cry,” he said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll be glad, because they’ll have you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart as a presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was discovered in an extramarital affair on a boat called Monkey Business and retired from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, very frustrated, thought there was no reason not to explore the idea of running for president herself.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” he told me as he laughed 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone said, "Whitebeard and the Seven Dwarfs."
As he arrived late to the campaign, he was behind with the fundraiser, so he promised that he would not enter the race if he did not raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 to the men, were only willing to give $250 to her.
“Do you think I have a discount?” he asked.
When she delivered her speech and announced that she would not start a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions (gratitude for the people who had helped her, frustration with the system for the difficulty of raising money and for orienting herself to the voters, instead of to the delegates, and anger, and sexism) that she was left speechless.
“You might have thought I was having a nervous breakdown,” Ms. Schroeder recalled of the press reaction.
“You might have thought my corporate sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking: What will they put in my grave?

How the U.S.-China trade war can benefit Beijing
The initial salvos in the U.S.-China trade war were deafening, and while the war does not seem likely to end soon, a estrangement of the countries may prove beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts said.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year when he imposed taxes on China’s top exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week, with new tariffs affecting products worth 200 billion USD. These tariffs involve the imposition of taxes on half of all goods arriving in the US from China.
Beijing has fought back in the same way each time and recently raised tariffs from five percent to 10 percent on $60 billion of U.S. goods.
China has pledged to replicate the U.S. and it is not likely that the world’s second-largest economy will be pushed back anytime soon.
Turning Washington back means giving in to some demands, but bowing publicly to the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards right, the pressures of the trade war with the US could benefit China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that initiate a fall in either of these countries is far more dangerous than witnesses had anticipated,” said Abigail Grace, an Asia-focused research associate at the Center for New American Security, a committee of experts.
Syria 'ready' to return refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help to rebuild the country, ravaged by a war of more than seven years.
Speaking before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
“Today, the situation on the street is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress that has been made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas that the terrorists destroyed to restore normalcy.
All conditions are met for the voluntary return of refugees to the country who had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and their maintenance.
The EU estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
There are also six million people living in the country in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime appreciates any help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from the countries that financed the insurgency.
The European team wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, on the outskirts of Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European team won the crown again when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's reached the 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who fought for most of the tournament, threw the exit shot into the water to the hole par 3 16, which yielded the victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shone in all his series and became one of four players to have achieved the 5-0-0 since the current tournament format began in 1979.
Jordan Spieth of the United States was given a 5&4 by Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The most qualified player in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2–1 to Ian Poulter of England, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran with eight Ryder Cups, the Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the biggest winner the tournament has ever had, with 25.5 run points.
"I don't cry, but I can't help it today.
It's been a very hard year.
Thank you, Thomas, for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so glad I got the cup back.
The team is the most important thing... and I’m happy to have been able to help,” said Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the baton to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a one-on-one competition on Sunday.
“I’m incredibly proud to have won Tiger Woods, I grew up following him,” said Rahm, 23.
Woods lost all four games he had in France and now has a career record in the Ryder Cup of 13-21-3.
A strange statistic for one of the best players that has ever existed, with 14 great titles won and only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-end golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said: “I’m proud of these players, they fought.
This morning there was a moment when we put pressure on the European team.
We fought.
I'm taking my hat off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played well.
We will regroup, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and move forward.
I love these 12 players and I am proud to have been their captain.
You have to take off your hat.
They have defeated us.”
