This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widespread, but it offers details that fossils normally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
. Scientists say that the feather of this animal was brownish brown at the top with a light-colored or carotenoid background.
The finding also offers insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed cannon, called rachis, but do have other characteristics of bearded and barbary feathers, the researchers deduce that the rachis was surely a more recent evolutionary development than these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used to fly but to regulate the temperature or to display. The researchers have suggested that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample presents the plumage of an adult and not a chick.
The researchers suggest that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample reveals an adult plumage, not a plumage.
Yesterday morning a car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two police officers and injuring more than 20 people.

They have discovered that the Sun operated on the same basic principles as other stars: it has been seen that the activity of all the stars in the system depends on their brightness, their rotation and nothing more.
The luminosity and rotation are used to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the flux of plasma.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star will be with respect to magnetic inversions.

The work done has been mostly theoretical, but the program has been written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts an attraction on the earth, which causes the tides, the Milky Way exerts an attraction on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as regular matter.
This theory says that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located around a galaxy in a kind of halo, and is made up of many tiny particles.
Some television reports show white smoke coming out of the plant.
Local authorities are warning neighbors in the vicinity of the plant not to go outside, turn off the air conditioners and do not drink tap water.

In France, elections have traditionally been a not-so-technological experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and put in an envelope a preprinted sheet of paper with the candidate they have chosen.
After those responsible verify the identity of the voter, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the ballot paper.
The French electoral law strictly codifies the procedures.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that there are no envelopes at the beginning of the vote and that no envelopes are added other than those of duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to testify to each part of the procedure. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under strong supervision, following specific procedures.

Four skiers from the women's sit-down group did not finish their races, and 45 of the total of 117 skiers from the giant slalom failed to qualify for the race.
The laptop and mobile phone that had been stolen were recovered thanks to the work of the Madhya Pradesh police.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and we have recovered her mobile phone and her computer."
The defendants are called Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in court with his face covered.
Although there were three people inside the house when the car hit, no one was injured.
The driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident took place was temporarily closed as emergency services released the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was admitted to Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in the Scottish Sheriff’s Court charged with the murder of her son.
He is in custody pending indictment and trial, but any visual testimony could be rejected because his image has been published everywhere.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish justice works differently and the courts have seen the publication of photos as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee points out that "journalists seem to be walking a dangerous line if they post photos, etc. of suspects".
The office of the Crown, which is in charge of the charges, has told reporters that it will not make further statements, at least until the sentence.
The document, according to the leak, will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants to establish according to the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Among the other issues discussed are the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the dispute over the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands an uninterrupted military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement has been signed, while the PA only pledges to accept it for five years.
Hunters in the supplemental pest control pilot test had to be closely monitored by forest rangers, while the pilot test was monitored and evaluated for efficacy.
In an association of NPWS and the Association of Sports Shooters of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited, under the Association of Sports Shooters hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Acting Director of the Conservation and Heritage Park with the NPWS, the four hunters selected for the first hunting operation received proper safety training and training.
Yesterday Martelly took the oath of office of a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members.
It is the fifth Provisional Electoral Council of Martelly in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous Provisional Electoral Council, as part of a package of measures aimed at moving the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The protests, sometimes violent, were triggered by the lack of holding of elections, some of them planned for 2011.
Nearly 60 cases of iPod malfunction and overheating have been reported, causing a total of six fires and causing minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it had been informed of 27 device-related accidents.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that Apple had reported 34 other incidents related to overheating, which the company called "not serious".
In response, the ministry called Apple’s adjournment of the report “frankly unfortunate.”
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 AM local time (09:19 PM GMT on Friday).
The Northern Marianas Emergency Management Office said no damage had been reported in the nation.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there had been no tsunami signalling.
A former Philippine police officer has been held hostage by tourists from Hong Kong to hijack their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at tourists.
Many hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, as well as Filipino photographers, have recently been released.
Photographers later took the place of an elderly lady, who needed to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was shot dead.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a career in medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature labor in his spare time.
Their research showed that if a hormone was administered, the fetal lung maturation of the baby would be accelerated.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two “black boxes” of flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Moon was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died the night of two moons. Pretty unique, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels has commented that "Moon was as freaky as I am...it can be even more...I love her and I'll find her at the altar...I hope she's in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people asked before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic grew 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard declared during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of respondents want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the ends of the poll, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The winner of the Olympic gold medal had to swim in the 100 and 200 meters freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his physical fitness has been left in doubt due to his complaints.
He has not been able to take the necessary medicines to endure his pains because they are prohibited in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, has discovered the largest prime number discovered as of January 25.
Many people verified the discovery using different hardware and software in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water sent to Earth along with organic matter that can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, since comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his government earlier this year and signed a law last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political gossip and nonsense."
It is speculated that he will run in the 2016 presidential election.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, would allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to the old ground-based radar technology to make traffic controllers locate pilots much more accurately and send them more accurate information.
Reinforcement of transport is not contemplated and surface trains will not stop at Wembley; at street level there are also no car parks or connecting car parks.
The concern of a lack of transport has led to the possibility that the game must be played behind closed doors without fans of the team.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science described the formation of a new species of bird on the Ecuadorian islands of Galapagos.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species has evolved in only two generations, although it was thought to take much longer for this process, due to the cross between a Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes (endemic), and a cone-beaked Galapagos finch.
Gold can be worked in all kinds of shapes. It can be molded into the smallest figures.
It can be inserted into thin threads, which can be twisted. It can be struck or flattened into sheets.
It can be made very thin and stacked on top of other metals. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted images of books called "illustrated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a substance. You can make an indicator using cabbage juice.
Lombard cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) it is a substance.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the pH H) in the test substance.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been removed (as hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders and then, with wet clean hands, make a ball.
The moisture of the hands reacts with the outer layers, which causes a strange sensation and forms a kind of barrier.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remnants of sewage have been discovered in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women met in joint company.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back, almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts part of our light and our view.
A giant rocket 100 feet tall is required to place a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. The most outstanding fact that the wheel has done for us has been to make transportation much faster and easier.
We took the train, the car and many other means of transport.
Below them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (including wild domestic cats) that eat small prey that are far more abundant, such as small insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of its success is the concept of the niche, a special job that each cat has and that prevents it from competing with the others.
Lions are the most social felines and live in large groups called flocks.
Packs consist of one to three adult males related to up to thirty females and cubs.
Females are usually closely related, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion flocks behave largely like wild dogs or wolf flocks, which are animals with a surprisingly similar behavior to lions (though not to that of other large cats) and equally deadly to their prey.
The tiger, a complete athlete, can climb (although not very well), swim, jump great distances and push with 5 times the force of a forced human.
The tiger is from the same group (genus panther) of lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the full-voiced roar of the lion, but rather like a phrase called out of words of anger.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they can, they will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all the animals they hunt are much smaller than him.
Scientists believe that the ocelots follow and find the animals that are eaten (taken) with the sense of smell, sniffing out the traces they leave on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and they can also move very stealthily. The ocelots hunt their prey camouflaged with the environment and then flee over their prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) separates from the main and original group (for example, crossing a mountain range or a river, or migrate to a new island and cannot go back) they will often find themselves in a different environment than they had before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations than they needed before to be a strong competitor.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations were so different that they could no longer be considered the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is a consequence that cannot be avoided and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make the oxygen that humans breathe and take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e., exhale).
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses with plants and make clothes with plants. Most of what we eat are plants. Without plants, most animals could not survive.
Mosasaurus was the alpha predator of its time, which is why it was not afraid of anything except other mosasaurs.
Their long jaws had more than seventy teeth sharpened like knives, accompanied by an additional play in the sky of the mouth, so that there was no escape route for anything that stood in their way.
We don’t know for sure, but he may have had a forked tongue. His diet included turtles, long fish, other mosasaurs, and he may even have been a cannibal.
He also attacked everything that entered the water; not even a giant dinosaur like T. rex could rival him.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had a few rare or unusual products at their banquets; such as boars, peacocks, snails, and rodents called doves.
Another difference was that, while poor people and women ate seated in a chair, rich men liked to participate in banquets to dine together.
Ancient Roman meals could not have included foods that have come to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tried a turkey.
The Babylonians built each of their gods a primary temple that was considered the house of the god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods and the chaplains tried to cover the gods' needs with ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then a closed sanctuary to which only the chaplains could access.
Special pyramids in the form of towers, called ziggurats, were sometimes built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the gods.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, housing was not so important.
Most of the Jewish family life was spent in the open air.
Women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were simple open counters looking down the street. Stone was used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. The Norse sagas say that Eric the Red was exiled from Iceland due to a murder and, while traveling west, discovered Greenland and gave it its name.
However, despite their discovery, there were already Eskimo tribes living there at that time.
Although they were all "Scandinavian" countries, there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you’ve seen the movie National Treasure, you might imagine that behind the Declaration of Independence they wrote a treasure map.
Now, that's not true. Although there's something written behind the document, it's not a treasure map.
Written behind the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The text is at the bottom of the document, down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its creation the long parchment (measured 293<0xE2><0x81><0x84>4 inches by 241<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 inches) was rolled up to store it.
Thus, it seems that the notation was added simply as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
It was ruled by "Vichy" France. These were Frenchmen who had signed peace with the Germans in 1940 and who collaborated with the invaders instead of facing-'shi.
The Allies invaded southern France on 15 August 1940, the invasion being called "Operation Dragon".
Within two weeks, the American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were advancing into Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by an important group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and this also defines in some way the dimensions of society.
City-states preceded nations. A civilized culture involves the transmission of knowledge across many generations, a persistent cultural footprint, and equitable dissemination.
Minority cultures often disappear without obvious historical traces and are not recognized as civilizations proper.
During the American Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government with the Congress being its sole component under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and, as there was no national executive or judiciary, it fell to the often uncooperative state authorities to enforce all of its acts.
Nor did it have the authority to invalidate tax laws and tariffs between states.
The Articles needed the unanimous approval of all states before they could be amended and states took over the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The national football team of Italy, with the national football team of Germany, is the second most successful team in the world and were the champions of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
The best-known sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
The most popular sports in the northern regions are winter sports, with Italians participating in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (Honshu is the largest), making it the 7th largest island in the world.
Because of the group of islands Japan has, we often call it, in geographical terms, an "archipelago".
The beginnings of Taiwan date back to the 15th century, when European sailors in passing coined for the island the name Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southeastern Taiwan, where it initiated the transformation of indigenous grain production practices and turned to Chinese workers for rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty forces (1644–1912) took control of the coastal areas of western and northern Taiwan, and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded the sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings, which are the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.
Thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored in 1976 and the restoration continues today.
For example, the most common frame format in the world is 35mm, which was the main film size at the close of the analog film era.
It still occurs today, but even more importantly: its aspect ratio has been inherited in the sensor formats of digital imaging cameras.
The 35 mm format creates, in fact, a bit of confusion, with 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
It is said that the aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are the same or closely related to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which has been overused and often ridiculed, is a simple pattern that creates dynamism while maintaining order in an image.
He says that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection between the lines that divide the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see example).
During this period European history came into question the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion united the European states despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power affected everyone, from kings to commoners.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the monetary funds of the church exist precisely for this reason.
The main authority of the church had been in Rome for more than a thousand years and this concentration of power and money meant that many people wondered if this dogma was being fulfilled.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international laws that had been codified by various international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering full segments of the ocean, endangering even neutral ships.
Because there was a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitude among most citizens and nations was that of pacifism and isolation.
Having seen the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wished to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job with the Edison Company of New York.
He came to the United States with four cents to his name, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss at the last job he had) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different historical epochs: each stage of China or each ruling family was a different dynasty.
Also between each dynasty there was an unstable period of divided provinces. The best known of these periods was the time of the Three Kingdoms that took place for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In these periods fierce wars took place between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms era was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient China, thousands of people died fighting to sit in the highest seat in the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Equally after the Revolution, occupations were opened to all men who requested it allowing the most ambitious and successful to achieve it.
This also applies to the military, because instead of basing the ranks of the army in classes, from that moment on they were based on relevance.
The French Revolution also inspired many other people from the repressed working class in other countries to begin their revolutions.
Muhammad became deeply interested in matters that go beyond this worldly life. He used to frequent a cave that would be known as "Hira" on the Mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived the passage of time, gives a very clear picture of Muhammad’s spiritual inclinations.
At the top of 1 of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, and even knowing its existence, it is not easy to find. Isolation is absolute once you get inside the cave.
Nothing is seen except a serene and beautiful sky above the head, and the abundant mountains that surround it. There is very little of this world that can be seen or felt from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still stands.
Built by the Egyptians during the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramidal structures built to honor the dead Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis", in the Egyptian Valley of Death contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were erected in honor of Pharaoh's wives and family members.
The "upward arc" sign resembles the letter V (see below) and the "downward arc" looks like a staple or a square without the bottom side.
When it appears upwards it means that you have to start at the tip and push the bow upwards, and when it is downwards it means that you have to start at the heel (which is where your hand holds the bow) and stretch the bow downwards.
Scrubbing the strings from right to left produces a softer sound, while rubbing the strings in reverse produces a louder, more assertive sound.
Take the liberty of writing down your own directions, but keep in mind that bow marks are there for a musical reason, so they should be respected.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, her two young children (Marie Thér<0xC3><0xA8>se aged 11 and Louis-Charles aged four) and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced by a crowd of women merchants to return to Paris from Versailles on 6 October 1789.
In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and wailing threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to bring the windows of the carriage fully open.
At one point, a member of the crowd showed the head of a royal guard murdered at Versailles in front of the horrified Queen.
The war expenses of U.S. imperialism during the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime, in order to defray much of the expenses and interest on the bonds floated on behalf of the Philippine government through the Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the great gains derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the basic gains of U.S. imperialism.
In order to understand the Templars one must understand the context that promoted the creation of order.
The time in which the events took place is popularly known as the Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The Middle Ages were preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice encompasses a wide range of ideas, from the technological push or the technological imperative to a strict sense that human destiny is guided by an occult logic that is associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology, at the same time, has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it could be said that motor cars necessarily lead to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network for a handful of cars is not economically viable, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The possession of cars en masse also leads to a higher incidence of accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new medical assistance techniques to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had an important component of cultural determinism, drawn by writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped people, and over time customs and cultures related to that geography appeared that were better than arbitrarily imposed laws, since they were in harmony with the place and with society.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation for being an epicentre of luxury began in around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its status declined during the 12th century mainly because the Crusaders had returned bearing gifts such as silks and spices that were more valuable than those offered by Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital went from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its maximum popularity in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries, and in the 14th century.
Initially, the dress was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to the slowness of the communication channels, the styles could reach the west 25 to 30 years later.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of the time is that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to button clothes.
Subsistence farming is the farming that is carried out to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic, system that uses native ecoregion stored seeds combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing nations.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel abandoned by societal standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be differentiated due to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
Qualities that determine a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture are often distinguished from those of other subcultures by the distinctive and symbolic use of a style, which includes fashions, customs, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to resort to the few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults as they grew up, due to neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse.
These children are called "wild" or feral. Some wild children have been isolated by people (usually their parents); in some cases, this child abandonment was due to the rejection of the child's severe intellectual or physical deficiency by the parents.
Wild children may have suffered child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or run away.
Others have supposedly been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild all alone.
The wild child, when raised only by non-human animals, exhibits behaviors (always within physical limits) almost identical to those of the animal that raises it, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
Although project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the scaffolding goes one step further.
Frame theory is not a method of learning, but an aid that provides support to individuals undergoing a new training experience, such as learning to use a new computer program or starting a project.
The scaffolding can be virtual or real: in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the small Microsoft Office assistant clip.
The virtual scaffolds are internalized in the software and are designed to question, show and explain procedures that may have been too complicated for the student to leave on his own.
Children are welcomed for different reasons ranging from abandonment to abuse, through extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment where they are not nurtured, loved and educated, but there are those who do.
We believe that the family foster care system is a form of security for these children.
Our foster care system must provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
It is assumed that the reception confers all the needs that were not covered in the house from which they were originally taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of its focus on uses and gratifications.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important reasons for internet use (James et al., 1995).
Personal involvement and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new motivating aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998), when they investigated the public's reaction to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it can be detected if a person lies by correctly interpreting their microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The King's Speech, pointed out how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are still able to assess sincerity accurately.
It even suggests that these interpretive capabilities of human behavior could be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
In the 20th century, research has shown that there are two sets of genetic variation: hidden and exposed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the whole heritage of variation that is expressed.
Segregation and recombination combine the back and forth variation between the two genetic heritages in each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system such as that of humans to meet its amino acid needs with available plant resources.
In addition, failure to do so has serious consequences: stunting, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The easiest plant resources to obtain would have been the proteins provided by the leaves and legumes, but unless they are cooked, they are difficult to digest by primates like us humans.
On the other hand, foods of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digested, but provide a large amount of proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
However, we should not be surprised that our ancestors solved their “protein problem” as the savanna chimpanzees do today.
Interruption of sleep is the process of getting up during the normal period of sleep and falling back asleep after a while (10 to 60 minutes).
This is easy to do using a quiet alarm clock that makes you aware but doesn’t wake you up completely.
If you are one of those who resets the clock while sleeping, try to put it on the other end of the room, so that you have to get up to turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythms include drinking lots of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bedtime, so one is forced to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is correlative in an opposite way to the amount of tension in one’s body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the present life force. Each person has the potential to find peace and full satisfaction.
Everyone can reach enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but spread by the path of love of the Mahayana and by many Indian yoga techniques.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
Kundalini Yoga awakens kundalini energy (illustrated energy) through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the deity. By visualizing various deities, the energy channels are cleared, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was the common enemy in World War II, which facilitated collaboration between the Soviet Union and the United States. With the armistice came the clash of systems, processes and cultures, and both countries became enemies.
Two years after the end of the war, the former Allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It lasted the next forty years and was fought in earnest, with proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, to Afghanistan, to Cuba, and many other places.
By 17 September 1939 the Polish defences had been penetrated and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganise at the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete throughout the night, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and created the fronts in Belarus and Ukraine after they had invaded the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the bilateral Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international and Polish non-aggression treaties.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient method of moving large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
The job of the Marines has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move people and goods, while at the same time interfering with your enemy's ability to move his people and goods.
One of the most relevant recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans were attempting to displace men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mostly submarines, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, it is likely that Germany would have been able to conquer Britain, just as it did the rest of Europe.
Goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros range of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to domesticate them to easily dispose of milk, hair, meat and skin.
Domestic goats used to be kept in herds grazing on hills or other grazing areas, often watched over by shepherds who used to be children or teenagers. These grazing methods are still used today.
Wagons were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the tracks consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they swung from the horse-drawn wagons to reach higher speeds and to lift larger loads in the more difficult parts.
Crossings were introduced rather early to keep the tracks in place. However, it was soon seen that the tracks would be more efficient if they had an iron cover on top.
This became common practice, but iron further wore down the wooden wheels of the wagons.
In the end, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. The first completely iron rails were introduced in 1767.
The first known means of transport was walking, humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (which means right man).
Their ancestors, the Australopithecines, did not walk upright on a regular basis.
Bipedal specializations have been found in fossils of austrolpitecs from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although sahelantropes may have walked on 2 legs at full stretch 7 million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to partly reduce the suffering that might exist in the future.
This works only as a symptomatic treatment in most cases. However, if we do not want only a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problems and we should turn them off.
It is quite evident that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advances of humanity, and that the problems have grown due to the overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle of humans.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft, signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thompson, was sent to John Dunlap's printing press a few blocks away.
During the night between 150 and 200 copies were made, which today are known as "Dunlap flyers".
The first public reading of the document was held by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who had it read to his troops in New York on 9 July. A copy arrived in London on 10 August.
The 25 Dunlap pamphlets that are still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of this document. The original manuscript copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and that it is alive. We call them birds.
Many people do not see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many traits of birds that resemble those of a dinosaur.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on their hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus.
Virtually all the computers we use today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two possible values, that is, 0 or 1, and these numbers are known as binary digits or bits, according to computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be obvious immediately. Symptoms, such as vomiting are quite general, so you can not make an immediate diagnosis.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open medicine container or toxic household chemicals.
Look for instructions on specific first aid for the specific poison on the label.
The term insect is used by entomologists formally for this group of insects.
This term is derived from the ancient kinship with bedbugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Both the reduvids and the bedbugs are nidiculous, adapted to see in the nest or dwelling of their host.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), leaving it as the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, formed by the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has concluded that women are twice as likely to suffer from multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their best interests or their child’s best interests.
These couples may choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the birth parents end their parental rights so that another couple can adopt the child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this method guides most scientific research.
However, experimentation is not the only one, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses; the formulation of questions and observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts and, in particular, the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As Greek knowledge dwindled, the East found itself disconnected from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simple responses to periodic external stimuli, have been documented in most living things, such as bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are autonomous oscillators that follow a period of inertia even in the absence of external signals.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the first indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments by marking the DNA of the virus with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the virus with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, whereas mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, including the wildlife of plants and animals.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying ecosystem information.
One example is visiting, photographing and learning about Bornean orangutans.
Every morning, people drive out of small rural villages to go to their workplace and pass by others whose workplace is the place they just left.
In this dynamic vehicle everyone, in some way, is connected to, and supports, a transportation system based on private cars.
Science shows us today that this huge coal economy has disrupted one of the stable states of the biosphere, which has supported the evolution of man during the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries you will rarely hear so many complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transport systems generate this kind of complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transport engineers incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that are established between them.
Unfortunately, studying the flow of traffic is difficult because the driver’s behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers usually behave within a fairly constant range; therefore, the flow of traffic tends to have considerable constancy and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent the flow of traffic, relationships have been established between its three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships aid in the planning, design, and operations of roadway facilities.
Insects were the first animals to conquer the air. Their ability to fly helped them flee from enemies more easily and find food and mate more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings around their body.
This provides them with a wide variety of tiny places where they can hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are the spiadimonis and the ephemeral.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system moved around the Sun.
There were people who thought that what he was saying was true, but many people believed the opposite; that the Solar System was moving towards the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
This seems reasonable, because we don’t have the feeling that the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes six miles wide.
20 percent of the water that flows from the planet’s rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km long and collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of pyramids with stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical excellence of the construction of the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed.
Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom period were fascinated by the monuments of their predecessors, which were then well over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and in official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most people living in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper have been known since ancient times, all of which can be discovered in nature in native form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, proposed that everything consists of a mixture of one or more of a total of four elements. These were earth, water, air and fire.
It was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although in addition, according to his theory, they changed to become new substances that form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget that the periodic table has many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course there are also other metals such as silver and gold.
One can also have alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
The whole universe is made up of matter. All matter is made up of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that billions of atoms would fit within the end point of this sentence.
In this way, the pencil became a good friend of many people when it was invented.
Unfortunately, with the advent of new writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to a minor status and uses.
Nowadays people write messages on computer screens, without ever needing a sharpening machine.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will become when something new emerges.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to bind a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Similar to pushing a heavy cart uphill. Separating the core again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break up with a small or zero collision.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called crust.
The crust is 70 km thick in the nearest part and 100 km thick in the farthest part.
It is thinner under lunar seas and thicker under mountainous areas.
There may be more lunar seas on the visible face because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to come out on the surface.
Content theories focus on finding out what people like or are interested in.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have become internalized as they mature into adulthood.
These theories look at what makes certain people want the things they do and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two famous content theories are Maslow's Theory of the Hierarchy of Human Needs and Hertzberg's Theory of Two Factors.
In general, two behaviors can appear as administrators begin to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is to try to continue as "one more boy" (or girl).
This type of manager has trouble making unpopular decisions, applying disciplinary actions, carrying out evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding others accountable for their actions.
In the opposite case, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels that he must change everything that the team has been doing and make it his own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often ends in clashes between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual computers are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional computers, but with some small differences.
Members of a virtual group usually function as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They usually have more autonomy than members of conventional teams, as their teams can meet according to different time zones that local management may not understand.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member is addressed. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the long process of establishing a learning organization? One of the goals for putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
Creativity and ingenuity can flourish when all available resources are used efficiently in the functional departments of an organization.
Consequently, the joint work of an organization to overcome an adversity can lead to an innovative process to respond to the customer's need.
For an organization to be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provided physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognition research. Therefore, it narrows the area of research and makes it much more accurate.
The correlation between brain pathologies and behavior supports the research of scientists.
It has long been known that different types of damage, trauma, injury and brain tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and investigate never-before-seen brain structures and processes.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand processes in our minds.
Although AI has strong science fiction connotations, it forms a very important branch of computer science that studies behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
AI research involves making machines to automate tasks that need intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning, and scheduling, the ability to respond to client diagnoses and questions, and recognition of handwriting, voice, and face.
These things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as it has been built into various home computer and video game applications.
Thematic outings are an important part of any class. Very often, a teacher would love to take her students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
The technology offers the solution with virtual field trips. Students can see museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or contemplate the beauty of art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual trip is also an excellent way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future students.
For example, each year students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capital, each year the site is updated, but old versions are kept online as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve student writing. Although students often start their blogging experience with a careless grammar and spelling, this usually changes with the existence of an audience.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to strive to improve writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogs "force students to be more astute with the world around them." The need to nurture audience interest inspires students to be smart and curious (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to expand learning beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can help students to be more analytical and critical; they can define their positions in the context of which others write and also highlight their own perspectives on specific issues by actively responding to internet materials (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada’s charming bilingual capital and boasts a number of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada’s past and present.
To the south is Niagara Falls and the north is home to the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
It is all these elements, among others, that make Ontario stand out in the eyes of outsiders as a Canadian city par excellence.
The population of the large northern tracts is rather sparse, and some areas are almost uninhabited wilderness.
To make a comparison of populations that is usually surprising: there are more African Americans living in the U.S. than Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest by far, and a continent in itself in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, and undertook a great journey to the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape European Route in India.
To the north, the region borders the Sahel, and to the south and west the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is advisable for any female traveler to say that she is married, regardless of her true marital status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (one that does not look too expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences can cause what they would consider harassment, and it is not uncommon to be persecuted, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Reject men firmly, and don’t be afraid to defend your position (with or without cultural differences, it’s not okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Amazonian fishermen in the 10th century BCE, and was used by Phoenicians, Romans, and Benimerins as a strategic port, bearing the name Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and re-built it under the name of the White House, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city with the name of Daru l-Badya, the name of Casablanca comes from the Spanish merchants who established commercial bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in Morocco.
In the vicinity of the ancient Medina we can easily find places of sale of traditional Moroccan products, such as tajins, pottery, leather objects, hookahs, and a wide range of souvenirs, but it is all designed for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, towards the far east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, mostly in the center.
While Goma is considerably safe, it would be wise to investigate before making any visits outside of this city to assess the state of the fighting that persists in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and for some of the most economical mountain gorilla tracking in Africa.
You can use the boda-boda (moped taxis) to move around Goma. The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese francs for the short trip.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuctu" has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates's "Wonders of the African World" special on PBS.
The city is in sharp contrast to the rest of the country's cities because it has a more Arab than African air.
Kruger National Park is located in northeastern South Africa and runs along the border of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River marks the southern border.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each assisting diverse wildlife.
It is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is considered the benchmark of South African national parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, a daily conservation and entrance fee must be paid.
It can also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which allows entry either to a selection of parks in South Africa, or to all of South Africa's National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists consider the main center.
The set of buildings that make up the urban silhouette of Hong Kong has been related to a bright bar graph that is evident with the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the other side of the Kowloon waterfront.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely populated on land reclaimed from the sea along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonizers occupied, so it’s a good place to start if you’re looking for evidence of the territory’s colonial past.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, extending 80 km (50 mi) inland into Bangladesh and India from the coast.
UNESCO has declared the Sundarbans a World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not only mangrove swamps but include some of the last remaining stops of the mighty jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about a third is covered with water/swampy areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have become a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that in the area there are now 400 royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 axis tigers.
Buses leave from the intercity bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since buses between districts are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to get around nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Panakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It extends along the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers have a height of 83 meters, is 378 meters long and has two lanes of 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical open space under the bridge is 15 meters. Although construction was completed in August 2011, it was not possible to transit it until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully functional by September 2017, when Brazil’s customs are expected to be ready.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, and lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribes such as the Guaycur<0xC3><0xBA> and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called "The Giant Province of the Indies", was created in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunci<0xC3><0xB3>n in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The most important annual tournament of this sport takes place in December in the polo fields of Las Ca<0xC3><0xB1>itas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news about the tournaments or where to buy tickets for polo matches, visit Asociaci<0xC3><0xB3>n Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), with a set value equivalent to that of a British pound (GBP).
The money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
Generally, British pounds are accepted throughout the islands and within Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also accepted.
Credit cards will probably not be accepted in the outlying islands, although British and US currency can be accepted; check with the owners in advance to determine which payment method is accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so you have to do it yourself.
Since Montevideo is located in the south of the Equator, there it is summer when in the northern hemisphere it is winter, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone. In the summer months, temperatures above 30 °C are common.
Winter can be falsely cold: temperatures rarely reach sub-zero levels, but wind and humidity combine to make the feeling colder than what the thermometer signals.
There are no particularly "rainy" or "dry" seasons: the amount of rain is more or less invariable throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, they are still wildlife and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bones and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from other wild animals!
As docile as they may seem, bison, elk, moths, bones, and almost every large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured for not having left a sufficient distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Also, keep in mind that odors attract bones and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly food and keep the camping site clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of almost 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of a famous insubordination in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to abandon it.
All ships were sunk, except for a British cruiser. In addition, almost 200 lives of Americans and Germans were lost.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city resulted in the death of supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
The beaches are abundant, as Auckland is straddling two ports. The most popular are located in three areas.
North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) face the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Most of them are sandy beaches where swimming is safe, and most have shade thanks to the pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are in Waitemata Harbour, in the expensive neighbourhoods of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are sometimes family beaches filled with a good range of shops along the coast. Swimming is safe.
The best known local beer is the "Number One"; it is not a complex beer, but it is pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
Many French wines can be enjoyed here, but wines from New Zealand and Australia do not quite tolerate travel well.
It is completely safe to drink water from the local tap, but if you are afraid, bottled water is easy to find.
For Australians, the concept of carving is foreign. A short coffee is an espresso, the capuchin comes well laden with cream (no foam), and the tea is served without milk.
The crumbled chocolate reaches Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive but the quality is excellent.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year and injuries due to any of these causes are rare.
However, it follows the recommendations of the authorities, respects all signs and pays close attention to safety warnings.
Cubozos are found near beaches and river estuaries from October to April in the north of 1770. Occasionally they can also be found outside these months.
Sharks do exist, although they rarely attack humans. Most sharks fear humans and run away from them.
Sea crocodiles do not make active life in the ocean; their main habitat is the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the peace of mind of knowing that he will have a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although you can book other forms of accommodation, such as camps, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport, or even packages combined with flight and hotel.
They can also keep your reservation if you need time to think about the offer or to present other documents for your destination (such as a visa).
Any requests or suggestions should be sent first to the travel agency and not to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of attendees decide to camp there, and most attendees consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you’ll need to get there early to get somewhere to camp near the music.
It should be remembered that although the music has been finished on the main stages, there may be sections of the festival that continue to play well into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the north of the Baltic in winter, check the location of the cabin, because crossing the ice generates a terrible noise in those most affected.
Cruises in St. Petersburg include time in the city. Passenger cruises are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos often strive to maximize the time and money their visitors leave behind. There are usually no windows or clocks, and exits can be hard to find.
They usually have special foods, drinks and entertainment offerings to encourage guests and prevent them from leaving the establishment.
Some venues offer alcoholic beverages inside the house. However, drunkenness alters judgment, and all good "gamblers" know that it is important to stay sober.
Anyone driving at high latitudes or between mountains should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or very low temperatures.
Friction is low on icy, snowy roads, and you can’t drive on them like you’re on bare asphalt.
During a snowstorm, enough snow can fall so that you can be trapped in a very short time.
Visibility may also be reduced by snow falling or being displaced by wind, or by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, snow and ice conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic remains uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are probably the main tourist attraction in Africa and the most relevant for many tourists.
The term safari in popular usage refers to the journey over land to see fantastic African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants or giraffes, tend to approach cars, and standard equipment will allow for good views.
Animals such as lions, cheetahs and leopards are occasionally shy, which is why you will be able to see them better using binoculars.
A walking safari (also called "rural walking", "hiking safari" or "footing") consists of hiking, either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will take place in other places in Japan.
Tokyo will be the first Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you could find yourself in a delicate situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but since the end of March most cancellation policies due to the coronavirus do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympic Games were to be held.
Most tickets to the event are expected to cost between <0xC2><0xA5>2,500 and <0xC2><0xA5>130,000, with a typical ticket costing around <0xC2><0xA5>7,000.
Ironing wet clothes can help dry it. In many hotels you can ask for an iron and an ironing board, even if there is none in the room.
If there is no iron available or if you do not like to bring ironed socks, then you can try using a hair dryer, if available.
Be careful not to allow the tissue to overheat (it could shrink or, in extreme cases, sag).
There are different ways to purify water, and some are more effective against certain hazards.
In some areas it is enough to boil the water for a minute; in others it takes a few minutes.
Effectiveness changes from filter to filter, and in case of concerns you should consider buying water from a well-known brand in sealed bottles.
Travelers may encounter pests of animals with which they are not familiar in their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, in worse cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases, or animals capable of injuring or killing people by force, are usually not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy duty-free goods in certain places.
Travellers tied to heavily taxed countries can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Freeway, which frequently passes through isolated wooded terrain.
If you are not used to driving on rural roads, be careful: steep slopes, narrow sections and closed curves predominate.
The speed limits indicated are noticeably lower than those of other earlier and later sections – generally 35–40 mph (56–64 km/h) – and strict adherence to the limits is even more important than if it were otherwise.
Although it is curious, the mobile phone service is more powerful here than in many other segments of the route, such as Pennsylvania Wilds.
The German pastry is quite good and that of Bavaria is many and very diverse, similar to that of Austria, its southern neighbors.

With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a generic term to cover a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
But, if used without any other qualifier, the term usually means food originating in the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
Nowadays, Javanese cuisine is easy to find all over the archipelago and offers a wide variety of dishes seasoned in a simple way. The favorite flavors of Javanese are usually those of peanuts, blackberries, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic species.
The stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang from each side of the saddle.
They are more stable for the rider, but may present safety problems because the rider's feet may become trapped.
If a rider throws himself off the horse but has one foot stuck to the stirrup, he could be dragged if the horse runs away. In order to minimize this risk several safety precautions can be taken.
To begin with, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a single thin and thin force.
In addition, some saddles, particularly the English ones, have safety bars that allow the leather of the stirrup to fall from the frame if a rider pulls it back down.
The Cocham<0xC3><0xB3> Valley: Chile's most prominent climbing destination, also called the Yosemite of South America, features many large granite walls and cliffs.

Alpine sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that consist of sliding down snow-covered slopes downhill with skis or a surfboard tied to your feet.
Skiing is an important travel activity with many enthusiasts, often known as "ski booms", planning the entire vacation around skiing to a particular place.
The concept of skiing is very old there are cave paintings symbolizing skiers from before 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, but it was in 1861 that Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Traveling with backpack on skis: this activity is also called rural skiing, skiing tourism or skiing hiking.
It is related, but generally does not involve alpine skiing or mountaineering, the latter executed on rugged terrain and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Imagine a ski trail as something similar to a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you’ll be able to travel slightly longer distances than walking – although on rare occasions you’ll get the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on flattened slopes.
Europe is a relatively small continent but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling between several countries would involve having to make many visa applications and passport checks.
The Schengen area, however, functions as a single country in this respect.
While staying in this area, you can generally cross borders without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, having a Schengen visa does not require applying for a visa for each of the Schengen countries separately, saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition for manufactured items that are considered antiques. Some tax agencies determine that goods over 100 years old are antiques.
The definition has geographical differences, where the age limit may be lower in places such as North America compared to Europe.
Artisan products can be categorised as antiques, although they are more recent than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding is an important means of livelihood among the Sami and the culture surrounding the trade is also important for many with other trades.
Even in tradition, however, not all Sami have been related to large-scale reindeer breeding, but lived off fishing, hunting, and the like, having reindeer primarily as draught animals.
Today, many Sami work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sami territory.

Extreme weather is the general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, major social disruption or loss of human lives.
Extreme weather conditions can occur around the world, and there are different classes that can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.

Regional and seasonal severe atmospheric phenomena include turbidity, snowstorms, and sandstorms.
It is strongly recommended that travellers be aware of any risk of adverse weather affecting their area as it could alter their travel plans.
Anyone intending to visit a country that can be considered a war zone should take a professional training course.
An internet search for “Hostile Environment Course” will likely offer the address of a local company.
A course will normally cover all the issues that have been covered here in better detail, usually with practical experience.
A course will normally last 2 to 5 days and will include role-playing games, many first aid and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines that talk about survival in the wild are frequent, but there are few publications that deal with war zones.

Preoperative transsexuals should not expect to go through scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Hangover currents are the flow that returns after waves collide with the beach, often at a reef or similar.
Because of the topology of the water, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper stations, and a strong current can form into deep water.
Most deaths occur as a result of fatigue when attempting to swim back upstream, which may be impossible.
As soon as you step out of the current, swimming backwards is no more difficult than usual.
Try to go somewhere where you are not captured again or, depending on your abilities or if you have been informed, you may want to wait for a rescue.
The return shock comes before the culture shock (with a smaller honeymoon phase), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travellers who have found it easy to adapt to the new culture often find it particularly difficult to re-adapt to their native culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have already adapted to a new culture and lost some of the habits of the native culture.
When you went abroad, at first probably people were patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
Sometimes it is not anticipated that patience and understanding are also needed when travelers return home.
The sound and light show of the pyramid is one of the most interesting things in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and in silence before the show begins.

The scenes of the story are shown above the pyramids, which are illuminated at the same time.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are disputed between many nations and have the most bases, with sixteen active by 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Among others are the islands of Livingston and Deception, where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano confers a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the southern region of the Peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula here merge and form a plateau, then re-emerge to form the 360-km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, broken off by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or Sentinel Range has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with a maximum of 4,892 m of Mount Vinson.
In remote locations and without telephone coverage, satellite telephony may be your only option.
A satellite phone is not usually a substitute for a mobile phone, as you need to be outside with a clear line of sight to make a phone call.
The service is usually used on boats, including recreational vessels, as well as on expeditions that need remote data and voices.
Your local phone service provider should be able to give you more information about how to connect to this service.

There will typically be tuition fees for enrolling in these educational programs.
Finland is an important sailing destination. The "land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands, within the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You do not need a yacht in the archipelagos and lakes.
Although any yacht can pass through the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Sport sailing is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every 7 or 8 people.
This is equivalent to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but it is also quite special (for example, in the Netherlands the figure is one to forty).
Most of the various Baltic cruisers make an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that it is possible to visit the historic center of the city using a couple of whole days returning to sleep on the boat at night.
If you only disembark with excursions on board, you do not need an independent visa (dated 2009).
Some cruises show Berlin, Germany, on the brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not at all near the sea and the visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be a terrifying experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, particularly if they have not flown before or have had a traumatic experience.
It is not a cause for shame: there is no difference with the fears and personal apprehensions that many people manifest towards other things.
For some, having notions about how an airplane works and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or not being in control.
Courier companies charge well to deliver things quickly. Often, time is very important for business documents, merchandising or replacement parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, larger companies have their own aircraft, but there was a problem with other routes and smaller companies.
If they sent things by plane, there are routes where unloading and passing through customs can take days.
The only way to send it faster, was as checked baggage. The regulations of the airlines will not allow them to send luggage without a passenger to take it, and this is where you enter.
The obvious way to fly first class or business class is to pay a good bundle of money for this privilege (or, even better, get your company to do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: as a rule, you can expect to pay up to four times the price of the economy rate for business class, and up to eleven times in first class!
In general, it makes no sense to look for discounts on business seats or first class on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain group of passengers who are willing to pay more for the privilege of getting to a place quickly and comfortably, and pay accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chi?in?u. The proper language is Romanian, but Russian is in common use.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.

Economic ties have been restored between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion of Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
?zmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of approximately 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transport hub.

Do not damage the site by painting or engraving graffiti on structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Almost half prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the signs are only in Catalan because it is, by law, the official priority language.

During visits to monasteries, women should wear skirts that cover their knees and also cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries offer blankets to women who do not come prepared, but if you bring your own, especially one with bright colors, you will get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Likewise, men should also wear pants that cover their knees.
This piece can also be ordered at the entrance, but it is clothing that is not washed after each use, so you may find it uncomfortable to wear these skirts. The size is unique!

However, people who can speak a little Spanish may hastily conclude that Portuguese resembles it so much that it is not necessary to study it separately.
Premodern observatories are mostly obsolete today, and remain as museums, or places of education.
Since light pollution at the time was not a problem as it is today, they are usually found in cities or on campuses, easier to access than those currently built.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The contemplation of cherry blossoms, an action known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept comes from China, where the cherry blossom was the most appreciated.
In Japan, the first celebrations of cherry blossoms were organized by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.

Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christendom, and it celebrates the birth of Jesus.
Even non-believers in Christian and non-Christian countries around the world have embraced many of the traditions surrounding the holiday.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night in the open air to watch the sun rise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it is very plausible that it is a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil on Saturday night during the Easter weekend, and congregations usually begin celebrations at the stroke of midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally came to the island did so by swimming, flying or floating.
The great distance from the mainland prevented the mammals from getting to travel there and this caused the giant tortoise to become the first grazing animal of the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of man in the Galápagos, many mammals such as goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs have been introduced.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic areas in winter, you will experience the polar night, when the sun does not come out over the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the aurora borealis, as the sky will remain dark virtually all day.
Since the areas are sparsely populated, and therefore light pollution is not usually a problem, you can also enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners are used to seeing.
Dresses are the standard business attire, and co-workers are called by their family names or by their job titles.
