Barack Obama will be the fourth U.S. president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
U.S. President Barack Obama will fly to Oslo, Norway, to spend 26 hours there and be the fourth U.S. president in history to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
The $1.4 million diploma, medal and cheque will be presented to him, among other things, for his outstanding efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and collaboration among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will land in the morning in the Norwegian metropolis and have a busy schedule.
He will first visit the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time the five members of the Committee who chose him in October among 172 people and 33 organizations.
The presidential couple’s schedule then includes an interview with Norway’s King Harald V and Queen Sonja.
The visit will culminate in the afternoon at a solemn ceremony where Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth U.S. president to receive it, but only the third to be awarded the prize inside the Committee.
The White House said in advance that Obama would talk about the war in Afghanistan at the award ceremony.
The president does not want to avoid this issue because he is aware that he is receiving this award by being a president who is waging war in two countries at the moment.
He reinforced the war effort a few days ago by sending additional units to Afghanistan, which none of his critics will forget to point out.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a check for ten million Swedish kronor (about 1.1 million euros).
He plans to donate it to charities, but has not yet concretely decided which ones.
His busy schedule will then take him and his wife to a banquet including, in addition to the King and Queen of Norway, the head of government and 250 other guests.
Obama was rather reluctant at this price at first.
He mentioned, for example, that he felt that he did not fully deserve it.
He also repeated several times that this is not a prize for him alone, but for all those who defend the same values as him.
As soon as the announcement was made, he said it would be an "invitation to act".
Nature Advocate Accused of Blackmail
Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice police have charged the president of the Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice Nature Conservation Society with blackmail.
Several times last year he appealed for several construction site procedures and asked for money from investors for his personal profit in exchange for the withdrawal of his appeal, said Alena Romová, spokesman for the Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice police.
The president of the Society of Nature Conservators of Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice is Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ka.
He is currently in detention and faces up to three years in prison.
Waste sorting bins are not scented in Brno
In Prague everyone can sort their beverage packaging, while in the villages of South Moravia you come across sorting bins on every street corner.
What about Brno?
There, you would need to take several minutes before finding the right dumpsters.
I don't mean that we wouldn't sort the waste in Brno at all.
But I have the impression that the city councillors in our city, the second largest city in the country, are not sufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is in the stone age of waste sorting, not only because citizens can still only sort paper, glass and PVC, but especially in view of the number of bins dedicated to this waste.
Have you ever tried to throw a plastic bottle in the city center?
It is a whole science, which requires above all time and nerves of steel.
The only place I have found at the moment is the Moravian square in front of Potrefena Husa.
That Mr. Onderka and his colleagues do not resent me, but it seems to me damn little.
Not to mention the fact that in other areas of the city it is not a sinecure either.
So in the end, many of my friends don’t sort their waste.
Par laziness.
It's giving them a hard time getting to the dumpsters.
I'm not surprised by them.
I myself, after a party, proposed to go throw some bottles of glass and PVC.
Except I didn't see any colored dumpsters on Kounicova street.
Fortunately I found the right place by taking the tram.
That said, the waste was overflowing.
It is after all the center of Brno, which is supposed to best represent the city, right?!
It is probably that ecology and a so-called aestheticism do not interest the socialists of Brno too much.
They prefer to buy the city a place in the first hockey league that shames the city throughout the country, instead of buying a few extra dumpsters and proposing the sorting of more raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I am glad to have been able to confirm my impression with official statistics after having lingered for a while on the internet.
According to data from the company EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the entire South Moravian region.
Paroubek's budget has removed cash from pensions and sick leave
After the left has grown, despite the opinion of the government, farmers or civil servants it may be that there is a lack of money for pensions, sick leave or housing savings.
But also for interest on state debt or international judicial proceedings.
This will increase the problems of those who will govern in the second half of next year, says the Minister of Finance Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists imposed the increase for certain classes, they relied on the fact that the government will make loans for sensitive expenses, pensions or sick leave. "It's just putting off the problems, mining the ground," Janota said.
It must be known that on borrowed money the interest to be paid is increasingly high and that it will have to be returned sooner or later.
The state doesn’t really have a choice as to where to draw money.
If he doesn't cut welfare or spending, he'll have to raise taxes.
To all those whom the left has now increased: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And then to their children.
People will touch them and should not fear for their pensions or health insurance, of which 1.8 billion have disappeared.
But at the expense of a greater debt of the state - next year it will not miss 163 billion in the coffers, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will thus grow faster and faster and with it, the expenses related to interest.
The state will need money to repay it and it will no longer be enough to slightly increase VAT or reduce maternity leave as the government did in its anti-deficit package.
It will also lack five billion to complete the construction of roads and railways because of the transfer of money to a few groups of voters.
These are mainly sections that have already been decided upon and started, and it is not possible to modify the projects in order to possibly reduce costs.
At most, keep them, which is not free either.
This means delaying or halting 30 major projects, and the withdrawal of European funds is also at risk, according to Karel Hanzelka, spokesman for the transport ministry.
The <0xC4><0x8C>SSD has proposed to solve the financial deficit very skillfully - it will draw on the dividends of the <0xC4><0x8C>EZ (electric power supplier and distributor), which the state owns for the most part and will feed into the transport fund.
The concern is that the amount of dividends is never certain and that it is in no way a bottomless pit.
Last year, 18 billion were navigated from the <0xC4><0x8C>EZ to the budget.
Every year, dividends are used to pay for the removal of ecological damage, to supplement pension accounts or serve as a reserve for the pension reform that is being prepared.
Moreover, this trick increases the real budget deficit to 5.7 percent of GNP under EU rules.
And this is far from the end of the carnival of transfers.
The budget for various compensations to the victims of communism and crimes, or even housing savings, has decreased by almost three billion.
It is not certain that the state can act without this money.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international proceeding, we will have to pay for it anyway, notes Janota.
The minister will then have to save on the department’s side or, in the worst case, touch the government’s budget reserve.
There is also a lack of a two-billion-euro state fund project, which is intended to track the spending of each administration online.
The first stage will start in January.
If the finance minister does not find money elsewhere, the project will have to be stopped and sanctions will take place, warns Janota.
Your next smartphone will have two operating systems
In the future, Americans are considering a mobile phone that will allow the user to switch from one operating system to another by pressing a single button.
The projects that have been revealed look promising.
With just one button, you can switch from Windows Mobile to Android in seconds.
It is precisely this possibility that is the goal of the American company VMware, which deals mainly with the development of virtualization software for computers.
We will allow you to manage two user profiles at the same time on your mobile phone.
You can alternate between them, you can differentiate them in personal and professional
Both will work at the same time, Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware said in an interview with Computerworld magazine.
It was introduced in November last year and was first demonstrated a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization on smartphones is not fiction at all.
VMware has already successfully presented a test version to journalists, a smartphone equipped with two operating systems.
This is a modified Nokia N800 with a RAM of 128 MB, which ran the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems simultaneously.
The development of new technologies for mobile phones is booming.
VMware is now working with European and U.S. carriers to test virtualization on smartphones, and customers are expected to have access to the devices later in 2012.
The lack of snow in the mountains bothers hoteliers
Deserted slopes are not only a problem for ski lift operators.
The lack of snow deters people from booking their ski stays in hotels and pensions.
As a result, it is always possible to find free rooms for all dates in winter, including Christmas and New Year.
We have a lot of visitors on our site.
Internet users browse the offers, ask for prices but do not dare to commit to book at the moment.
And if they call us, they ask right away if there will be snow or mud at Christmas," said Martin Jandura, operator of the Spindl.Info news portal.
If you want to spend the New Year of your dreams in <0xC5><0xA0>pindler<0xC5><0xAF>v Ml<0xC3><0xBD>n, it is better not to hesitate to book.
If you give priority to savings and the quality of accommodation only comes next, then you can try to wait a few more days.
Hoteliers in <0xC5><0xA0>pindler currently only offer one-week stays for the New Year.
I think they will try for another moment to place them, but they too will give in and accept shorter periods.
And then the number of free rooms will quickly decrease," said Jandura.
The tourist agency Ingtours of Vrchlab<0xC3><0xAD> also offers free beds for all winter periods.
The Christmas week interests us the most for the moment, it is not completely sold.
There is still free, say, half of the rooms in our offer.
That's why we have already prepared some cheaper last-minute Christmas holidays," said Ingtours director Petr Schiefert.
The tourist agency of Vrchlab<0xC3><0xAD> can also offer New Year in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e, but there are fewer free places.
The first fourteen days of February start just as well, the remaining winter stays sell out on average.
This year, interest in winter holidays has been negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e.
People are waiting for it to fall.
No one wants to spend the winter in the mountains without snow.
If the tracks overlap during the week, Christmas too will be complete," Schiefert thinks.
In contrast, the occupancy of the Horizont Hotel in Pec pod Sn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>kou is slightly higher than last year.
We have an improvement of about five percent.
We have a few last places for the New Year as well as for Christmas.
There is a lot of interest during the Polish January holidays and February is selling well too," reports Karel Rada, director of the best hotel in Pec.
The Omnia Hotel near the Jánské Lázn<0xC4><0x9B> central car park is also eighty percent complete during the New Year period.
On the contrary, half of the beds remain empty at Christmas in the newest hotel in Jánské Lázn<0xC4><0x9B>.
This year we have been pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we already have sixty percent occupancy at the moment.
February is a little weaker for the moment but as soon as the snow falls, the interest for stays in the Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e will certainly grow again, said the director of the Omnia hotel, Erik Sporysch.
However, Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e hoteliers should not expect more snow.
On Thursday it will be cooler and if there is rain, it should be snowy in the mountains.
But thereafter, the weather should warm up, informs Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Jakubsk<0xC3><0xBD> from the Hradec station of the Czech hydrometeorological institute.
Repetition is the Mother of Wisdom
It even becomes comical, the assiduous effort with which Barack Obama, president with a reputation for wisdom, reproduces the strategy of his predecessor on the Afghan issue, which he himself considered very simple.
When he finally let his long-awaited doctrine perspire, it turned out that he had copied it on carbon paper since Bush’s Iraq scenario three years ago.
Not content with using in the text even several times the expression "as in Iraq", he did not hesitate, moreover, to use the title of Bush's speech of January 2007 as the title of his own speech: "A new road forward"
At the same time, he personally criticized Bush’s idea of sending new reinforcements into a war-torn Iraq as “irresponsible and a catastrophic decision in its consequences.”
The following months, however, showed that Bush's strategy, which emanated from the recommendations of campaign commanders, was the only one possible and likely to succeed to such an extent that the newspapers at present do not speak at all about Iraq.
This did not improve Bush's reputation, however, objectively speaking, it left his successor in a final situation much more favorable than one could have hoped for.
Barack Obama hopes that in Afghanistan, the miracle will happen again
It was again the campaign commanders who asked him for an increase in the military contingent, including the commander of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who even severely criticized the reticence of the White House despite the habits of subordination.
He asked for 40,000 men in order to make the situation more favorable.
The president hesitated for three months but in the absence of a better option, he at least swindled the general of 10,000 soldiers.
He managed to extirpate the promise of an additional 5,000 from Europe, even though he originally counted on 10,000.
What brings the most problems to Obama’s entire strategy seems to be his intention to withdraw the armies from Afghanistan within 18 months and to complete this whole process within three years. The whole Obama doctrine brings more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt that a halved increase will bring the same benefits as progress in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized and its leaders honor the agreements.
The Afghan situation stands out in exactly the opposite way - no one can be counted on and no treaty is respected.
In these conditions, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, accustomed to changing leaders day by day according to what suits them.
Political institutions, although officially founded, will remain only a powder keg behind which patriarchal ethnic relations will proliferate.
It is singularly complex to balance the interests of the various ethnic groups given the lack of clarity about the relationships, which are further complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a “state ready to act,” which is the basic purpose of the operation, does not seem to be very real.
The time horizon of Obama’s strategy is perplexing by its voluntarism.
In the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and is currently on the verge of chaos.
Only a purely romantic and out-of-reality heart can be persuaded that the little soldiers sent into the tumult of war with a view to their "prompt return home" will bring there a real miracle.
From a political point of view, setting a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible since the Taliban will regard it as the indirect admission of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the Europeans' willingness to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is moving in the negative direction.
European politicians do not know or want to explain to their voters how security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the Hindu Kush mountains.
Another factor capable of radically altering the situation is the evolution of events related to Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions have no effect on the Iranians, the Americans will find themselves facing the very difficult issue of resolving the problem through the use of military force.
It will have to be answered, for example, when, according to Obama, America will come to the victorious withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
However, any such solution would lead to a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
The only dent for Obama is the fact that there are three years until the presidential election and therefore there is still enough time for him to work on a new strategy, in case it turns out to be a total fiasco.
Goldman Sachs executives will no longer receive cash bonuses
The top management of the US bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive cash bonuses this year.
The company announced it in response to strong criticism of its wage practices.
The group of 30 senior executives will receive shares instead of cash, which they won’t be able to resell for five years.
Stocks can be withdrawn from leaders in case they take too much risk.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is at the forefront of the effort to link compensation with long-term performance on Wall Street.
I suppose Wall Street is well aware of the global meaning to be taken, said former investment banker Douglas Elliott of JPMorgan.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs has become the target of criticism after setting aside nearly $17 billion for bonuses over the first three quarters of this year.
For the current year, the total amount of premiums will likely exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today, according to Reuters.
With the onset of the financial crisis, high premiums in the banking sector have become a sensitive political issue in many countries.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it plans to apply a one-off tax of 50 per cent to bankers' bonuses exceeding <0xC2><0xA3>25,000.
France is preparing similar measures.
This year, women have won Nobel Prizes in every field except physics.
Five women, a record number, received today in Stockholm from the hands of the King of Sweden Charles XVI Gustav the Nobel Prizes in the technical disciplines and in literature.
Besides the four scientists there was also the German writer of Romanian origin Herta M<0xC3><0xBC>ller.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine for their research in the field of chromosomes.
The chemistry prize was awarded to the Israeli Ada Jonath with the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for clarifying the structure and function of ribosomes
The latest recipient of the Nobel Prize in Economics, the American Elinor Ostrom with her compatriot Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of economic governance.
The only technical discipline that didn’t have a winner this year was physics.
This award was presented today to scientists Charles Kao for his research in the field of optical fibers and George Smith with Willard Boyle for their invention of CCD chips, which are currently the basis of all digital cameras, fax or astronomical glasses.
Each winner received the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of acquisition of the monetary award.
This amounts to SEK 10 million in each category. (approximately € 1.1 million)
If one of them has several winners, they will share the reward with each other.
The long-awaited Nobel Peace Prize has already been awarded this afternoon in Oslo, Norway to US President Barack Obama.
The latter, in his speech, acknowledged the controversial nature of his award since he is only at the beginning of his career and is also at the head of a country engaged in two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In defense of his policy, he added that in some situations war is essential to obtain peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota is considering resigning. Klaus invited him to the Ch<0xC3><0xA2>teau
President Václav Klaus will receive on Friday morning Finance Minister Eduard Janota, who is considering his stay in the government because of his disagreement with the state budget for next year as it was voted by the Chamber of Deputies
It is estimated that the budget and perhaps also the position of Janota in the cabinet will be on the agenda of their meeting on Friday.
Klaus is also critical of the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which further deepens the crisis of public finances.
Presidential spokesman Radim Oshvat briefed the meeting.
Janota then wants to discuss his position with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday.
According to the budget legislation that will be submitted to Klaus for signature, it is a deficit of 163 billion crowns that the Czech Republic should manage.
Nevertheless, the Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday validated the left’s proposals on money transfers and increased the salaries of civil servants, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government blamed the Social Democrats' proposals for indirectly increasing the budget deficit.
For this reason, a violent disagreement was born between the left on the one hand, the government, Klaus and the right on the other hand, disagreement that questions the future of Fischer's cabinet which had been formed by agreement between the ODS, the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and the Green Party.
Critics say the budget, as voted on by MPs, removes the package of savings measures passed by Fischer's government, which he says must stem the state's debt.
Klaus, who can ratify the state budget law but is not obliged to do so, said today at a breakfast of discussions with entrepreneurs that politicians have long neglected the "serious problem" of the "irrepressible deficiency" of public finances.
Now there is, according to him, no favorable solution.
Only a strong government could bring about improvement, if it could rely on a broader consensus of political parties, according to the president.
ODS President Mirek Topolánek said the budget is staggering and the government should question its future existence.
ODS Vice-President Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as told the <0xC4><0x8C>TK that the idea of an administrative cabinet backed by the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, the ODS and the Greens is clearly no longer working.
In his response, Prime Minister Fischer called such words "drastic verdicts".
The head of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Paroubek reacted to Topolánek, saying that the budget deficit prepared for this year by the former Topolánek government is staggering and that it will exceed 200 billion kroner.
Already on Wednesday, the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD called the ratification of the state budget for the next year a success.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman to Play Mandela in Clint Eastwood's New Movie
Despite criticism that the lead roles are played by American actors, South Africans say the new Hollywood film Invictus – Undefeated will expose the world to a lot about the country, its struggles and victories.
The story is about sport, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, an Oscar-winning American actor, stars in the film about the life of Nelson Mandela, a tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and the first black president.
Freeman said it was an ninety-one-year-old Mandela who asked him to play him in the film.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I said, "If I'm going to embody you, I should be able to see you personally.
The seventy-two-year-old actor who was awarded a prize for his role in Clint Eastwood's drama Million Dollar Baby set in the middle of boxing has, for example, epitomized the leader of a movement against slavery who has become a slave himself, a living president of the USA so important, even God in the film Evan Almighty but never the same as someone else.
The former South African statesman has been jailed for 27 years for his hard work to end apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became the country's president for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word meaning undefeated and is the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film tells the true story of the joint efforts of Nelson Mandela and the captain of the South African rugby team Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois to unify the country. The newly elected President Mandela knows that his country remains still and still divided racially and economically after apartheid.
He is convinced that he can unite his people through sport and decides to unite rugby players who are among the underdogs of the world.
The South African team eventually progressed to the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for a few years to bring Mandela’s story to the big screen.
I had no other goal than to play this role in a way that brought him closer to reality,” Freeman said.
The biggest challenge for me was of course talking like him.
The actor said that if he and the international politician were in the same region, he would have tried to meet Mandela, to have dinner with him, to be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake his hand.
I realized that when I shake your hand, I get your energy back, it transmits and I felt like I know how you feel, he said.
It is important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon plays in the film Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Pienaar, the captain of a national rugby team in which there is a majority of white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the tough middle of rugby.
For him, his first meeting with Pienaar at his home was a big surprise.
I remember when I knocked on the door of the house, it opened for me and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar was, ‘I look a lot bigger in the movie.’
Despite the differences between the actors and the real models, Invictus under the direction of director Eastwood has received positive reviews and there is even talk of ambitions for the Oscars.
Film critic Todd McCarthy of the Daily Variety summed up his appreciation in these words: "It's a very good story, a very well made film."
In the film reviews on the website rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive reviews.
The mystery of the aura in Norway is solved: the Russians tested a rocket
A strange light phenomenon of unknown origin has been observed over Norway.
The Russian Defense Ministry only acknowledged yesterday that it had tested an intercontinental ballistic rocket not far from the Norwegian borders.
The launch, however, was still a failure and the “Bulava” type missile that was originally to be the pride of the Russian army is gradually becoming the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Its repeated presence during the rocket tests did not have the expected effect on the success of the test flights.
Most of the time, either Bulava did not fly, or it was damaged in mid-flight.
Russian newspapers talk about "Bulava" as a "missile that does not fly"
A missile that does not fly but shines
This 13th test was carried out at the beginning normally.
It was only at the end of the flight that there was damage to the aircraft again.
It was clearly the rocket's third stage engine that exploded.
This time, "Bulava" flew away from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskij, which was sailing under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can precisely be fired from a moving boat and submerged
This is why the mysterious light over Norway caused by an unidentified flying object was likely caused by a faulty "Bulava".
The Norwegians did not doubt for a moment that it was a Russian rocket.
The generals argue that this time, we can not absolutely talk about failure.
The first two stages of the rocket resisted and the damage only affected the third.
In the previous cases, the engines experienced failures on the first stage.
Although none of the test launches went without a hitch, Defense Ministry management considers that only six out of thirteen were failures.
This success rate of almost fifty percent therefore fills the generals with optimism and they always say that one day "Bulava" will fly without problems and that it will take even ten hypersonic nuclear cores with a total weight of 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov has signed a one-year contract with CSKA Moscow at the age of 51.
Legendary defender Vyacheslav Fetissov will again appear in a professional match at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup holder will lend a helping hand to his needy CSKA Moscow team and will probably make his debut already during Friday’s match against Petrograd.
Fetissov, who ended his career at the age of forty in 1998, is currently the president of CSKA.
After Denis Kuliash's injury we urgently need another defender.
Fetissov trains regularly and agrees to help the team.
We still need to work out some details on the form, said club coach Sergey Nyemchinov, quoted by the AP.
It was not specified if the comeback of the legendary hockey player will concern only one match.
I think Fetisov is one of those who are able to strengthen the minds of other players," said Nyemchinov.
According to AP, in the case of his return to the ice, Fetisov thus becomes the oldest Russian professional hockey player.
In the NHL, legendary forward Gordie Howe played an entire season for Hartford and scored 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous quintet Fetissov, Kassatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best hockey players and among those with the most success.
Under the colors of the Soviet Union he won gold twice at the Olympic Games, seven world championship titles, he triumphed in the Canada Cup as well as in the world junior championship.
In the second part of his career, he also collected tributes in the NHL where he twice held the Stanley Cup.
He has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame since 2001.
Hyundai has listened to unions and cancels all overtime
The management of the Hyundai plant in No<0xC5><0xA1>ovice has agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
It was precisely because of the frequent overtime that the unions declared a state of emergency strike on Monday.
Spokesman Petr Van<0xC4><0x9B>k of the Hyundai plant confirmed this.
However, management still wants to agree with the unions on a Saturday worked this year again.
We cannot give up our production plan, it is essential, that is why voluntary overtime was proposed on Saturday 19 December knowing that there would be two teams, said Van<0xC4><0x9B>k.
Sedmi<0xC4><0x8D>ka.cz reported that the company offered a bonus of 400 Czech crowns to employees who would be part of the team on Saturday.
It will also be awarded a posteriori for the day worked on November 28.
The company, according to Van<0xC4><0x9B>k, has decided to change the way it motivates its employees in exchange for overtime.
Either they receive the extra hours, or they can ask for a replacement holiday on 28 December and thus extend their holidays, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k said.
In addition to this, all employees present on Saturdays will receive compensation for transportation costs and for their lunch.
Given the fact that overtime was the most urgent and hottest point in the comments and claims of both unions and employees who spontaneously stopped production last week, management made the immediate decision to cancel all overtime for the month of December, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k said.
Until last week, employees at the auto plant were forced to work almost two extra hours a day in addition to their eight hours.
The unions intend to cancel the state of strike after signing the agreement.
The next negotiation between the management of the car plant and the unions is scheduled to take place on Friday afternoon.
Trade union leader Petr Kucha<0xC5><0x99> said on Wednesday that they were ready to stop the state of strike in case of agreement on their demands and the signing of a joint document.
The situation in the factory culminated last Wednesday when nearly 400 employees spontaneously went on strike due to incessant overtime.
They also protested against poor pay conditions and alleged hazing.
The management defended itself with the fact that the employees had to work extra to fulfill the imperatives in the production of automobiles.
When the strike was announced on Monday, the unions also demanded that workers who had stopped production should not be subjected to any sanctions.
The unions are asking the company to reduce the time spent in overtime to a minimum.
In addition, they want this year a reward of 5,000 crowns (about €209) for these.
The Hyundai car plant in No<0xC5><0xA1>ovice currently employs 2,000 people.
It started series production last year in November.
It has manufactured about 80,000 vehicles as of September this year, having a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that works on "endurant" HIV viruses too
A team of Czech and German scientists is testing new combinations that can slow the spread of the HIV virus in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also acts on viruses that have already developed immunity to drugs.
This reality takes, in some cases, the upper hand on the fact that the combination does not act as intensely on the common variants of the virus as well as some drugs already available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS at this time.
However, it is possible to radically prolong the life of patients through a mixture of drugs that prevent the multiplication of the HIV virus in the body.
However, their consumption leads to a series of side effects.
Moreover, the repression of this multiplication has the effect of the development of what are called resistant viruses on which drugs no longer have an effect.
The work of experts from three institutions, the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the V<0xC5><0xA0>CHT in Prague and the University of Heidelberg paves the way for a way to deal with the resistance of the virus.
They showed that substances called metallocarborans act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
Metallocarboranes are an assemblage of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination blocks the development of the virus in a different way than all the drugs used so far and that is why they could overcome the problem of resistance.
The work of the researchers leads them to discover new "improved" substances, based on their knowledge of the molecular mechanics of their bonds on the proteins of the virus.
Metallocarboranes have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-walled cages are formed by boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms and connected by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
A treacherous and resistant virus.
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the division of the HIV virus caused by HIV protease there would be no birth of mature infectious particles of the virus.
If HIV protease is stopped, the spread of the virus in the patient's body will also be stopped, the researchers explained in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In their work published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages (see table) are connected by a short organic chain, which is then systematically modified.
A little weaker but more reliable.
The efficacy of this series of substances on HIV proteases was tested in test tubes as well as on its resistant variants, obtained from HIV-infected patients.
On the current version of the enzyme, the effect of metallocarborans is not as strong as on clinical drugs, however it does not weaken on resistant versions against which common drugs are often ineffective.
Metallocarboranes, with their unique mechanism of action and other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications, are therefore interesting combinations to be examined further in order to move towards the development of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavl<0xC3><0xAD>na <0xC5><0x98>ezá<0xC4><0x8D>ová, director of the laboratory of structural biology of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry.
Dispute over the budget. The ODS attacks Fischer, who defends himself
The president of the ODS (Civic Democratic Party), Mirek Topolánek called the ratified budget for the following year "appalling" and said the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should question its existence.
The Prime Minister called the ODS speech a drastic verdict.
He says it takes time to analyze.
ODS spokesman Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as said the idea of an administrative cabinet backed by the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, the ODS and the Green Party was clearly no longer working.
According to Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as, the head of government should decide whether he takes to the Chamber of Deputies support on the minority that is concerned to fight against the growing deficit, or whether he is concerned to remain in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as warned that the positions of the ODS and the Social Democrats on the issue of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
The Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday ratified the budget for 2010, with the proposed changes to the tune of 12 billion crowns included by the left.
The Chamber has increased money for civil servants' salaries, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's grievance with the Social Democrats' proposals was that they indirectly increased the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic is expected to run a deficit of 163 billion kroner.
The ODS left the room before the vote, thus obeying the government's wish that an amended budget is a less bad variant than an interim budget.
Disappointment and Uselessness
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of futility, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said the government will think again about the current situation.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as is convinced that if Janota threatened to leave office if the proposed amendments were ratified, the situation could be different.
According to Czech Television, Janota made an appointment with the Prime Minister on Monday after his time in government:
At the same time, he indicated that he was wondering if he would remain in office.
His disappointment with the budget negotiations is the reason for this.
If Fischer decides to continue fighting the budget deficit, Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as believes that the representatives of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, who imposed the budget changes, have no place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House ratifies other deficit-increasing legislation such as health insurance, pensions, or reform of the Services Act.
Topolánek: the ministers appointed by the ODS are not in question.
This is the business of the head of government Fischer and the whole government.
The ministers appointed by the ODS did nothing harmful, Topolánek said in a textual statement from the United States.
He recalled that the deputy ministers of some ministries claim TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as pointed out that if Fischer decides to resign in the face of fighting against the amount of the public budget deficit, "it is quite logical and correct that it is based on the left-wing majority that is currently in the House."
That said, he should not expect the support and tolerance of the Democrats.
I have not thought about it and once it is on the agenda then I will devote myself to it, said from the House to journalists, the Minister of Defense Martin Barták, elected to the government precisely by the Democrats.
Prime Minister Fischer flew in the afternoon for a European Council debate in Brussels.
The ODS backtracked at the Prime Minister's request.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as stressed at the same time that the ODS would probably have voted against the amended budget on Wednesday if it had not expressly asked the Democratic deputies to allow the vote on the budget.
We do not feel that we are orphans, we are not little children, he reacted to the question of whether the ODS had not been criticized by the President of the Party in the House or in the country during the negotiation of the budget.
I did not notice that my vote would have failed.
“I already knew by the time I gave up my mandate that what would follow in the coming months would be a Bolshevization of the House and a destruction of all that was positive,” Topolánek said in person.
According to the new timetables of the <0xC4><0x8C>D there will be fewer trains for the same rates.
From 13 December, the Czech Railways will abolish or limit certain less-charged express or regional trains and, on the contrary, strengthen certain others.
The total transport coverage will decrease on the day of entry into force of the new timetables by two per cent compared to today.
Most rates will not change, including base and discounted rates.
It is for example the inhabitants of the Ostrava region who will have more connections to the capital, the Railways will add a pendolino train.
On the contrary, an express will stop serving Bratislava.
There will also be fewer fast trains on the line Prague - P<0xC3><0xAD>sek - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice, the direct line Prague - Letohrad will be radically reduced.
At regional level, the largest decrease in transport is in the Hradec Králové region by a total of eight per cent, while Prague and its surroundings can look forward to an increase.
Two night trains on the line Prague - Tábor - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice are also cancelled and the circulation of a few express trains on the line Prague - P<0xC3><0xAD>sek - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice will be reduced to only a few days in the week.
Among the biggest transformations can be seen the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague: for the moment the inhabitants of Milovice have to change to Lysá nad Labem.
This is the fifteenth line of the Esko suburban system, the opening of which is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line between Lysá nad Labem and Milovice.
The distant lines to the capital will have their final destination at Prague’s main station (Praha Hlavn<0xC3><0xAD> nádra<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>).
<0xC4><0x8C>D will introduce more SC Pendolino lines between Prague and Ostrava and trains to <0xC5><0xA0>umperk/Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k will depart at two-hour intervals.
Travellers will no longer be able to take the Pendolino to Bratislava from 13 December.
The bill this year for regional railways: an additional 200 million kroner.
The express trains are ordered and paid for by the Ministry of Transport and will pay the Railways next year a total of four billion kroner to settle the visible losses, the same amount as this year. The regional trains are ordered by the regions which will pay for them a total of eight billion kroner next year, knowing that the State will participate to the tune of almost three billion kroner.
This year regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The Railways have recently signed a contract for ten years, so far the duration was still one year.
The Railways appreciate the system, which also explains why they did not use a price increase on the vast majority of tickets.
The changes will only affect <0xC4><0x8C>D Net day tickets and eLi<0xC5><0xA1>ka discounted internet tickets.
For travellers without a discount card, the price of <0xC4><0x8C>D Net will increase from 450 to 600 kroner.
The price of eLi<0xC5><0xA1>ka will again depend on the route traveled, while until then it was valid between cities of a region of your choice and was at a single rate of 160 crowns.
Philippine rebels still holding more than 50 people, children released
The rebels have kidnapped 75 people in the southern Philippines, including some elementary school students and their teachers.
It was the AFP agency that informed, but who originally spoke of only 65 hostages.
The 17 children were released after eight o'clock, as well as one of the teachers.
The hostage-taking took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
About 19 rebels are reported to have used the hostages as human shields during a flight from the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to find an agreement for the release of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the rebels belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AFP agency, the police first prosecuted the kidnappers following violence caused during a settlement between two family clans.
Martial law has been declared in the province of Maguindanao in the southern Philippines because of a recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre linked to the governor’s administration elections were 30 journalists.
The governor of this southern Philippine province was arrested on suspicion of involvement in the massacre, along with his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan lineage.
Mindanao Island also includes active Muslim separatists.
However, they renewed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The history of South Africa concerns everyone, according to Morgan Freeman aka Mandela
Clint Eastwood's new Hollywood film is coming to theaters in the coming days, the title is Invictus (the official Czech title is Invictus: Nepora<0xC5><0xBE>en<0xC3><0xBD>), and chronicles part of the life of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous anti-apartheid fighter went to Morgan Freeman, who was chosen years ago by Mandela himself to play him.
The second male role of the legendary South African rugby champion has been awarded to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in theaters, the feedback from critics and the public is heard.
Nelson Mandela
Born Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela on June 18, 1918 in Mvezu, South Africa.
In 1988 he was awarded the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, and in 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize alongside de Klerk.
He was President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film contains high hopes as it is presented at a time when South Africa is in the midst of preparations for the football World Cup, and because the media is agitated by worrying news about the increase in racial conflict and discrimination of the inhabitants by the black majority in power.
According to the AP agency, the reactions to the new film are for the moment rather positive in South Africa, despite the frequent reservations about the main roles where Hollywood stars " strut ".
Morgan Freeman is, in his own words, proud of the film.
I have dreamed of this role for many years and I have prepared well.
I have also met Nelson Mandela personally many times to be able to - as they say - recover his energy, he said during the official premiere of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it’s a good thing if one has the opportunity to recall Mandela’s personality and message through the film.
This is the history of the Republic of South Africa, but it concerns every individual he added.
Wearing the national rugby team jersey
The film based on the story of the novel by the British writer John Carlin the title being freely translated. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the play that gave its creation to the people depicts the South African defender of human rights during his term as president.
Morgan Freeman therefore tries during the film to regroup two racial groups of a population long divided and like Nelson Mandela in 1995 he enters dressed in the national jersey of the South African team on the lawn of the world cup, which South Africa had won then.
For showing up on the pitch in jerseys, which is considered in South Africa as something sacred, Mandela had long been cheered on fourteen years ago mainly by the white public and was recognized by the white populations.
Hopefully the football championship will succeed in uniting people again into one nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who was in 1995 the only "black" of the national team.
It remains to be seen whether the tense South African situation will improve.
White South Africans are skeptical, however, as recently told in an interview for LN Christopher Dawson, a rugby fan who fled to Britain.
The championship begins on June 11, 2010.
A transformer worth tens of millions of crowns in flames in the Louny region
A fire engulfed in the morning a transformer of the company <0xC4><0x8C>eps of the distribution center near the municipality of V<0xC3><0xBD><0xC5><0xA1>kov na Lounsku.
According to Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Marvan, spokesman for the <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> fire brigade, there are six units operating on the fire.
They originally intended to let the transformer burn out, but they revised their opinion and put out the fire with a mixture of water, foam and a special substance.
The cause is a technical defect, an internal short-circuit of the transformer.
No one was injured and according to company spokeswoman Pavla Mandátova the incident does not endanger the safe operation of the transmission set.
The damage is estimated at a few tens of millions of crowns, the exact figure will be known once the fire extinguished.
According to Mandátova, the destroyed transformer will have to be replaced with a new one.
It adds that <0xC4><0x8C>eps has not experienced anything like this in its ten years of operation and that incidents of this kind are isolated.
<0xC4><0x8C>EZ spokeswoman for Northern Bohemia So<0xC5><0x88>a Holingerova Hendrychova said the operation of homes, administrations and industries was not affected by the fire at the processing plant.
A.s. <0xC4><0x8C>eps is the exclusive operator in the Czech Republic of transmission systems and power lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renovates and develops 39 distribution stations with 67 transformers transferring electrical energy from the transmission sets to the distribution sets and 4339 km long lines.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura to file defamation complaint against three <0xC4><0x8C>SSD prefects
Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, owner of Student Agency, will today file a defamation complaint against three Democratic social prefects.
And concretely against Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek of the South Moravian region, against Radko Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nka of the Pardubice region and against the prefect of the Olomouc region Martin Tesa<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura reported this in Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urnál's Dvacet minut.
The complaint is related to the company's attempt to operate regional railways in certain regions.
However, all regions eventually signed long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three of them attacked us and claimed that we were making the fine mouths, when we only made an offer for what they themselves wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways which is not true because we know the prices of the Czech Railways which were signed last week.
So all we have to do is defend ourselves.
This is in exchange for slanders about the Student Agency company, Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura told Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urnál.
Similarly, he said he had evidence that no region had proceeded in accordance with European law.
We are preparing a complaint for the European Commission.
Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek considers that Mr. Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura’s complaint represents the continuation of his media spectacle which serves as a free publicity for his company and for his person.
I am of course willing to defend my name and the name of my region and I call on the other prefects to do the same.
I suppose this will be an opportunity to make it clear that it is precisely Mr Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura who manipulates public opinion and uses false and misleading arguments about regional rail transport, says Hasek.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura has already informed last week that he will invest a few million crowns in an advertisement that will mention the unfavourable steps of the regions.
He told Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urnál that he will interrupt the campaign after Christmas and plan to resume it after the New Year.
He said the campaign will focus on corruption in the broadest sense.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura began its campaign after the regions agreed to entrust the Czech Railways with the operation of the rail links for an order of about 150 billion kroner, without issuing a tender.
According to Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, such a course of action is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions even brought threats to Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura from a member of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop, we might lose our bus licenses.
He introduced himself as a member of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, I don't know who he is but I won't say his name," Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura told Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urnál today.
Pneumococcal vaccination will be free and optional
Pneumococcal vaccination will reverse old habits as early as January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
There are already voices saying that mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free pneumococcal vaccination are peaking.
The pharmaceutical institute already defines the maximum prices that health insurance will pay for vaccines.
Specialists also see clearly in the vaccination process.
A new vaccination.
Free vaccinations for children in August.
Since January, children born last year from August 2 can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococci.
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
If you started the vaccination last year or earlier, you will have to pay for the following vaccinations yourself.
The first dose of vaccine should be given between the 3rd and 5th month of the child.
Already last year, a quarter of families voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumococci.
Yet parents paid 1,600 kroner or more for a dose.
Vaccination of the youngest requires four doses.
Experts estimate that every year health insurance spends 300-450,000 kroner on vaccine doses.
However, they save on the medical care that unvaccinated children would require.
Until now the state spent about 500,000 kroner a year on all vaccinations of children.
The reimbursed vaccination was introduced with the "Janota package".
Pneumococci are the cause of inflammation of the middle ear but also serious infections including inflammation of the meninges and blood poisoning.
According to hospital surveys, there are up to 28 deaths of children under the age of 10 caused by pneumococcal infections.
Aside from the Czech Republic, about 40 other countries have introduced the reimbursed vaccination.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
There are opinions regarding a possible vaccination obligation in the future.
From January, it must be paid by insurance and optional.
For example, the president of the association Nahlas Rudolf Kalovsk<0xC3><0xBD> indicated that a mandatory vaccination would be more positive.
Her association has long promoted pneumococcal vaccination.
At an international conference in which our association participated, the specialists were not really satisfied with the fact that we have an optional vaccination.
It's not ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy to have been able to impose at least this.
I think that this is a direction that must now be followed, Kalovsk<0xC3><0xBD> said.
But the Ministry of Health does not want to change the process of vaccination against pneumococci.
We are absolutely not considering it at the moment, said its spokesman Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88>.
Optional vaccination has its drawbacks, doctors say.
Hana Cabrnochová, president of the Specialized Society of Pediatricians, acknowledges that a vaccination based on voluntariata its shortcomings.
"In the situation where the vaccine costs so much, I understand the decision to make the vaccination optional," Cabrnochová said.
Experts predict that as early as next year, more than 80 percent of new parents will have their infants vaccinated.
The pneumococcal vaccination also marks a break from the fact that it is the first vaccination of children that is funded by insurance and not the state.
Cabrnochová explains that insurance should free up funds for prevention, thus saving on possible future medical care.
Doctors will have to buy their own products
This is, however, related to the concerns of practicing pediatricians, which relate to the purchase of vaccines.
The original intention was to have the vaccines purchased by insurance companies, with doctors receiving them in the same way as other vaccine products provided by the state.
Some MEPs feared, however, that this would allow insurance companies to "deduct sums from health insurance".
Thus, doctors will have to buy the products and wait for insurance to reimburse them.
It is estimated that individual pediatricians will have to invest nearly 40,000 kroner per month in vaccines, which is a significant sum.
It will be far from easy, according to Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved in a "Museum Flight"
Frank Frazetta’s son, a renowned illustrator, has been accused of trying to steal $20 million worth of paintings from his father’s museum.
In Pennsylvania, police said Alfonso Frank Frazetta was arrested while loading 90 paintings into his vehicle and a trailer.
She said Frazetta and another man used a mechanical shovel to force the museum into the Pocono Mountains area.
Mr. Frazetta Senior, 81, is famous for his drawings of characters such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
At the time of the incident, the artist was in Florida, the Associated Press (AP) reported.
AP quoted a police official as saying young Frazetta may have been motivated by a family feud.
According to a police statement, the 52-year-old Frazetta Jr. claims to have been allowed by his father to “enter the museum, by any means, to transport the paintings to a storage facility,” the agency reported.
Mr. Frazetta Senior denies giving such permission, the agency said.
The Labour Party is calling for an increase in the budget tax.
Ministers defended the tax increase and spending cuts announced in the pre-Budget report, despite criticism from the opposition, businesses and unions.
The Tories claimed that Alistair Darling "missed" an opportunity to show he was serious about reducing the deficit by postponing his decisions until after the election.
The Chancellor also took the heat by attacking low and average salaries.
Among its main proposals, we can see an increase of 0.5% in Social Insurance and a ceiling rate of 1% on public wages from 2011.
The Anger of Social Security
The unions have protested that low wages are being penalized by a recession for which they are not responsible and have warned that there are “problems” ahead.
The reduction in Social Insurance - which will get about 3 billion GBP a year - has angered the business world, because according to him, it is a tax on jobs while the goal should be a revival of the economy.
The increase, reserved for those earning more than <0xC2><0xA3>20,000 a year, will affect around 10 million workers.
KEY POINTS OF THE PRE-BUDGET REPORT
Social Insurance will increase by 0.5% from April 2011
The economy will decline even more than the 4.75% expected this year
New 50% Tax on Bankers’ Bonuses
The increase in corporation tax on profits for small companies has been abandoned
Tax rebates for electric cars and wind turbines
Increase in pensions by 2.5%
According to Treasury estimates, a person earning <0xC2><0xA3>30,000 will lose <0xC2><0xA3>90 a year and a person earning <0xC2><0xA3>40,000 will lose <0xC2><0xA3>190, while a person earning <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 a year will earn <0xC2><0xA3>110 more.
The ministers said their goal of halving the deficit by 2013 was leading to "difficult decisions" but insisted that 60 percent of the additional tax burden would be borne by the top 5 percent of employees.
Stephen Timms, the Treasury Secretary, refuted an increase in the tax and pointed out that a decrease in spending was a “drop in the ocean” compared to what was needed.
"These figures are important, they will allow us to halve the deficit, which will be absolutely essential over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident the economy would grow again by the end of the year.
However, Labour’s forecasts for economic growth – which will influence how much it will have to borrow and how quickly the deficit will be filled – have been called into question after the Chancellor was forced to revise his first figures.
In his speech, he said the economy would likely decline by 4.75% this year – far worse than the 3.5% decline predicted in April – while borrowing would be 3 billion GDP higher than the previous estimate.
'Opportunity missed'
The Conservatives, who will launch a new advertising campaign warning against Labour's "debt crisis" on Thursday, said the plan to borrow <0xC2><0xA3>789bn over the next six years was not viable.
Ministers failed to come up with a credible plan on how to repay, they added, “cynically” eluding difficult choices until after the elections – which are due to be held in June 2010.
"They didn't present anything significant about what they were going to do," said Philip Hammond, the Shadow Chief of Staff's Treasury. "They had the opportunity to do it and they missed it."
“Important announcements will be made after the election, regardless of the winner.”
by Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police will be protected from future cuts, contrary to the Tory proposals that would lead to a faster and larger reduction in the deficit.
But the Lib Dems claimed that the money raised through higher taxes and lower spending would be used to support next year’s spending and not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the plans were “built on wind”.
Nick Robinson, the BBC's political editor, claimed that the timing of announcements - such as the above-mentioned rise in inflation for certain disability benefits next April - would leave the Chancellor facing propaganda charges, with the money simply being recovered the following year.
However, Labour insists that more help is being provided when people need it most and that the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"False Budget"
Although ministers did not release details of spending beyond 2011, economists said it was clear that restrictions on public spending would only begin to be felt in the medium term.
The highly respected Institute for Fiscal Studies said the Chancellor's figures imply, in the future, substantial reductions in many areas, potentially including transport, higher education, science and defence.
“The pain is actually just postponed,” said Director Robert Chote.
“The most important announcements will be made after the election, regardless of the winner,” said Roger Bootle, economic adviser to Deloitte’s accountants.
"This was a false pre-budget report. The markets are well aware of it."
FBI Investigates ‘Arrests of Americans in Pakistan’
The FBI is investigating the arrest in Pakistan of five U.S. reporters suspected of extremist links.
The men were arrested during a raid on a house in Sarghoda in the eastern province of Punjab, the US embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said it was investigating whether these were the same men who were reported missing from their home in the U.S. state of Virginia last month.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs said it was also looking for information about these people.
Three of them are presented as being of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
If they are U.S. citizens, of course, we would like to know what the charges are against them and under what conditions they are being held,” said Ian Kelly, the spokesman.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
“We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their activities there, and whether it is the students who are truly missing,” she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men were arrested in a house owned by one of their uncles.
She said the house was already under surveillance by local police and that no charges had yet been laid against the arrested men.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrests, Reuters reported, but said the U.S. should "collaborate more with Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to uproot the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people."
The five students were reported missing from their homes by their families in Northern Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns Iranian "abuses"
Over the past two decades, human rights have been as under-achieved as ever, according to Amnesty International’s report.
the report presents "repetitions of violations" by the regime, before and after the presidential election campaign in June.
One man cited in the report claimed he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said he had been threatened with rape.
Iran has denied previous criticism of its failure to respect human rights.
The authorities have claimed that such criticism is politically motivated.
Thousands have been arrested and dozens killed in Iran after the disputed election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad led to the largest public demonstrations since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
Dozens have been sentenced to prison terms and prosecutors say at least five people have been sentenced to death.
Jon Leyne, BBC correspondent in Tehran, now in London, says that at the start of the protests, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei acknowledged some of the allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, the authorities have not tolerated any criticism, says our correspondent.
"False confession"
Amnesty International has documented the case of a 26-year-old computer science student, Ebrahim Mehtari, who said he was accused of “working with Facebook networks” and protesting against the election results.
“They often hit me in the face,” he was quoted as saying.
“I was burned with cigarettes, under the eyes, on the neck, on the head... They threatened to execute me and humiliated me.”
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still in blood and half-conscious, Amnesty said.
In August, the losing candidate in the elections, Mehdi Karroubi, claimed that protesters detained after the election were tortured to death in prison and that others were raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the rape allegations, but admitted that abuses had taken place.
Amnesty also cited a former detainee who said he was held in a container with 75 others for more than eight weeks in a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty agreed that Iran's parliament and judiciary should set up a committee to investigate the post-election unrest and the government's response, but said the mandate and powers of those bodies were not clear and the parliamentary committee's findings had not been made public.
The group said at least 90 people had been arrested in the past three weeks in an attempt to prevent further protests.
Ski slopes built in the city park
More than 100 tonnes of artificial snow was used to turn the Bristol site into a racetrack.
The Track in the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders competing for cash prizes.

Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
by Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be attracted by this new book, admirers of the author's latest book, "Why the French do not like the scarf" (2006), an elegant and well-documented study on a problem that has divided and preoccupied the country for about fifteen years and whose effects are still felt today.
Mr. Bowen’s latest book presents a much broader and more ambitious plot.
A good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is happening in the country right now.
He spent many months in the mosques, schools and institutes that now provide in France what Mr. Bozen calls “Muslim spaces” for the 5m-6m of Muslims.
He knows very well how to listen to and reproduce the debates between teachers and students on the issues that concern them most.
Should a Muslim get married in a mosque or in the town hall (or both)?
Should the evolution and rights of homosexuals be taught to young Muslims?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim?
Can a Muslim use an interest-based banking system to get a loan?
It is these practical problems, he says, that are the daily lot, rather than the political dramas that preoccupy the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They do not push the debate to the end.
Conservatives do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam.
Intellectuals and activists who have been interviewed by Mr. Bowen generally agree with their counterparts who advocate a purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia and who today make up a small portion of Europe's Muslims.
Bowen believes that the values of Muslims and the secularism of the French could be compatible.
But a compromise can only be achieved with the efforts of each side.
He wonders how much French politicians (and the virulent guardian intellectual elite of secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
According to him, Muslims were not spoiled, compared to Catholics, Protestants and Jews who also had to make historical compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than a growing pragmatism, it detects a "narrowness of key values".
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one is tempted to say "yes, but not yet."
The darkest view in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other place on the planet.
The ice that makes it up is melting at an alarming rate, taking with it a life that cannot survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing are navigating new open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their wake.
In "On a Thin Layer of Ice", Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, paints a natural history of the symbol of the far north, the polar bear.
A connoisseur of the history and complicated politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who proved their worth by hunting the polar bear.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson, then a courageous 14-year-old would-be fighter who had only the tip of his musket to fight, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young cubs, captured while swimming alongside their mother, who had just been killed, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a famous show gathered 75 bears at the same time.
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo are still usually one millionth of the surface area needed for an adult in the wild. the climate is rarely indicated: a polar bear living in Singapore became green due to the algae that grew in its thick fur.

Mr. Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians and often revisits the threat hunters pose to the survival of species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, killings continue in Greenland and Canada where helicopter hunters and Inuit Indians use powerful assault rifles to hunt their game.
Ironically, it is in the northernmost waters of these two hunting nations that the ice will remain the longest.
In his new book, “After the Ice,” Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and chilling summary of Arctic science and a captivating glimpse into what the future may look like there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can accurately report the speed of change.
It's not a failure to try.
At the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century, Fridtjof Nansen’s pioneering voyages gave the first information about the melting of the ice sheet.
The Cold War submarines then mapped the changes in relief below this one.
Satellite surveillance and probes placed on icebergs are a great help, but the bulk of the work is done by hardened men, camping in the cold.
Mr. Anderson contemplates the extraordinary and tiny world of the Arctic ice-dependent system, formed by nets of brackish water pressed together by freezing.
But from the above-mentioned bear to the microscopic wonders contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of the summer ice, expected between 2013 and 2050.
“In a few months, it may be our turn.”
Marines among 6,000 who laid wreaths on graves in Arlington
First-class De'Angello Robinson, 19, took a seven-hour bus ride to lay a simple wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who made the trip from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, North Carolina at Arlington National Cemetery to decorate the graves, this day was dedicated to greeting men and women who, one day, were in their place.
In a few months, from where we will be sent, we may be in their place,” Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If it happened to me, I would want someone to do the same for me, which is why I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of 6,000 volunteers who gathered Saturday morning to lay wreaths on the graves of veterans in different sections of the Arlington Ceremony cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of the Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, initiated the commemoration and others decided to decorate several hundred graves in the Arlington Ceremony cemetery.
Now, to continue an 18-year tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen, make the journey each year, stopping in different cities on their way, to organize commemorations in honor of the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit association, Wreaths Across America, which aims to promote the event in all other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns on the graves of Arlington Cemetery, around the Pentagon, on the graves of Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, in Battery Park in New York City, and on the site of the United Airlines Flight 93 Memorial in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year in a row, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to buy and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a career military man who died.
Although her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that for her, this gesture was a way of thanking those who had sacrificed.
This is a small gesture that civilians can make to support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Wrapped in several layers of warm clothing, the volunteers walked between the lawns and the extended hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers chose ancient graves, dating from the First and Second World Wars, as well as the Vietnam War, as these are not as often visited as the new graves, organizers said.
The mood was one of optimism, as children played and couples held hands, wearing fresh pine wreaths on grey graves.
Each round crown had a dark green color, with a small red bow tie on top.
Nearby, silence hovered over Section 60, where most of the veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried.
The United Service Organizations gave 1,000 crowns to decorate the section but the dark mood of the current wars filled the area.
Individuals cried without hiding, others prayed and families and friends supported each other in the cold air.
Some read aloud the names engraved in the stone while others leaned over to see the small black and white information cards, sunk into the damp earth for those whose grave had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many crying mothers at her son’s grave.
She left Zanesfield, Ohio, and drove eight hours to the grave of Marine Sergeant Gunnery David Shane Spicer, who died in action in July.
No one should ever forget what makes us free... my son paid for it, she said.
“Long after I’m gone, I want someone to remember him.”
U.S. citizen arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. national who distributed mobile phones and laptops in the country, U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs officials said.
The national, who has not yet been identified, works for Bethesda-based Development Alternatives Inc.
The company works on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
The consular authorities as well as the U.S. Interest Section in Havana are trying to gain access to the detainee who was arrested on December 5.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or foreign visitor may be arrested on the pretext of being “dangerous.”
All so-called revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical writings, carry the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing community of bloggers, led by Yoani Sánchez, a popular commentator who often writes about how they are husbanded and she is followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has made several requests to leave the country to receive awards but the permits have always been denied.
The detention of a U.S. citizen may heighten tensions between the communist government of the brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration, which is pursuing a “soft” approach to improving relations with the island.
The announcement of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times on Friday night.
The new U.S. policy insists that the Cuban government move forward with concrete steps, such as freeing political prisoners and creating more space for the opposition, so that the U.S. can return the favor.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although this is new and desired consumer goods in a country where the average salary of a civil servant is $15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban government has granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones; they are mainly used for texting or for a 15-minute conversation that corresponds to one day's salary.
On the island, the use of the Internet is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors in the country, as well as in some government buildings, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often have to communicate their name to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
Detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the few Americans incarcerated in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, says Gloria Berbena, press officer with the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she could not provide more information about the arrest.
Arrest and detention are a big mistake.
“An activity that, in any other open society, would be allowed — distributing mobile phones free of charge — is a crime in Cuba,” said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Americas program director at Human Rights Watch, which recently released a stern report on freedoms in Cuba, called “New Castro, Even Cuba,” referring to Raul Castro’s installation as the country’s leader to replace Fidel, his sick older brother.
According to Vivanco, an accused is often arrested, tried and imprisoned on the same day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, as the two countries begin to initiate a better dialogue.
Pakistani authorities prevent plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, Pakistani authorities spotted an organization allegedly plotting to send five men from Northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops, saying they hoped the case would dismantle a major network of terrorist recruiters scouring the Internet for radicalized young men.
Investigators claimed they were hunting down a hidden insurgent personality, known as Saifullah, who invited these men to Pakistan after discovering them when one of them made comments endorsing the terrorist waves on the internet video site YouTube.
Arriving in Pakistan, these men were guided by Saifullah who tried to help them reach the remote area of Pakistan’s tribal belt, home to al-Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who was briefed on the case said on Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince al-Qaida commanders that these men were not involved in the CIA plot to infiltrate the terror network.
As a result, they were isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the forbidden mountains of the northeast that have become a haven from terrorism.
They were considered undercover agents.
That is why they were rejected, said a representative of the authorities who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the confidential nature of the case.
The official said the men were determined and were still trying to obtain the necessary permits to enter al-Qaida camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law enforcement.
The case of the five men -- who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI -- underscores the crucial role recruiters play in identifying potential terrorists and, perhaps more importantly, determining who to trust.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, the US secret service has made it a priority to infiltrate men into the al-Qaida network.
The recruiters of the organization play the role of barrier guards, refusing entry to those who do not show a serious commitment and those who may turn out to be spies.
According to analysts, potential U.S. recruits are being closely studied by al-Qaida.
But they are also very attractive to the group because of their potential access to U.S. targets and their propaganda value.
However Evan Kohlmann, an expert at the US-based NEFA Foundation, said that terrorist groups must also be increasingly careful in recent years in choosing the people they accept because the US secret services have become experts when it comes to their recruitment methods.
“If you’re trying to infiltrate someone into these groups, what better way than to follow their recruitment model than so many other people have already followed,” Kohlmann said.
The model is the one that is increasingly on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of protesters in Copenhagen call for ‘action’ on climate
Tens of thousands of protesters marched through the streets here on Saturday, calling for greater action on the climate by negotiators working in the city’s Bella Convention Center.
The number of demonstrators was estimated at 100,000, but 25,000 according to police estimates.
The event took place relatively peacefully, although a small number of masked activists set off some explosives near a set of government buildings in the city centre.
On a day when little happened during the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists marched through the city, displaying signs in English saying “There is no Planet B” and one in Spanish, declaring “The Earth says it’s had enough.”
Several celebrities joined the protests, including top Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that traveling to her mother’s native Peru opened her eyes to the heartbreaking issues facing the country due to the impact of climate change already occurring.
That's one of the reasons I decided to join the big march -- to spread the word and call on leaders around the world to make fair, ambitious and committed decisions, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be undertaken, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
Police prevented protesters from coming too close to Bella and said they had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they were wearing a mask or were in possession of pocket knives.
Police prevented protesters from coming too close to Bella and said they had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they were wearing a mask or were in possession of pocket knives.
According to a passerby who asked to remain anonymous because of his involvement in the climate talks, activists wearing masks and black clothing set off several explosives near Copenhagen’s main canal which is surrounded by a few ministries.
They launched them near buildings, he said, adding that these were first rockets, followed by "a few big explosions".
Inside the Palais des Congr<0xC3><0xA8>s, people were gathered around television screens to follow the march, throughout the afternoon.
But it seems that the protesters have failed to awaken the consciousness of key authorities such as Su Wei, China’s climate representative.
When asked if he thought a demonstration would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, "Actually, it's something I wasn't aware of.
He then continued in Mandarin, stating "The event being important, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He observed that walking might seem harmful or useful depending on the perspective.
It shows the interest of the general public and different sectors on the subject of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, “you can also say that they disrupt negotiations or that they harm the freedom of others.”
Test results reveal tenacious differences between breeds
Last week’s federal report on math scores brought some good news for public schools in Washington, D.C.
Although the District still lags far behind the top establishments, the report shows that Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) are making far greater progress over the previous two years than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what emerges from the latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress is the persistent gap between African-Americans and whites, both locally and nationally.
The average scores of white Grade 4 (cm1) children in Washington, D.C., have increased over the past two years from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but those of their African-American classmates have increased by only three points, from 209 to 212.
The achievement gap actually increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African-Americans in Grade 8 (4th) generally remains constant, falling only one point, from 245 to 244.
The mean result of blanks was not included in the test results because the sample was not large enough.
The overview over a six-year period is no more encouraging.
In 2003, the gap between blacks and whites in Grade 4 (cm1), when the District's first NAEP report was released, was 60 points (262 to 202).
Although the results obtained by the children in both groups increased during this period, the difference was only reduced to 58 points.
Last week, some advocates in the District expressed concern that the rise celebrated by Group Director of Educational Institutions Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) were propelled by white students who were already good elements.
That would mean we raised the bar by looking at the top of the scale, which is problematic and upsetting,” said Jeff Smith, director of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit group that advocates for equality in district education.
“I’m not jumping for a point or two,” said Kwame R. Brown, a D.C. board member whose daughter is in Grade 4, at Eaton Elementary.
Often critical of Rhee's management style, Brown said the message from the test results is that the city's middle schools are in desperate need of attention.
Really, you always want to see the positive signs and I respect that.
But what’s scary is that we don’t devote enough time and energy to our middle schools.
Rhee said the District must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of struggling students.
This fall, for example, some teachers were trained to use a new method of reading, the Wilson Reading System, for students in the late elementary and early middle school grades who did not integrate the basics of reading earlier in their schooling and who are quite behind their peers.
Each day, the math program, for Kindergarten to Grade 6 (6th) classes focuses on games and real-life experiences, as they were set up in the District by former head Clifford Janey, who is also to be credited for the progress of the NAEP reported last week.
I just think we need to keep working to deliver better interventions to these students at a lower level than in the classroom," Rhee said.
Others believe that the NAEP results raise the question of whether Rhee can continue to elevate the overall results of the system while providing the money and resources for schools with less good results in order to narrow the gap.
It’s a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, an education trainer at the University of California, Berkeley who studies city test scores.
The conventional policy solution is to devote your resources and management reforms to schools in Washington’s poorest neighborhoods.
This targeting can also have political repercussions that hinder this important program.
But the problem, of course, is that like the other superintendent of schools, she is trying to use the middle class of whites and blacks.
We focus on ensuring the development of a system of good schools.
We need to strengthen our neighbourhood schools so that all families, no matter where they come from, are assured that their children can get an excellent public education.
Janey, now Superintendent of Schools in Newark, said in an interview this week that one of the key elements to narrowing the achievement gap was the length of the traditional public school, now 180 days in the District of Washington, to compete with charter schools.
It takes about 200 days to get the strength to change, said Janey, who struck a deal with her teachers’ union last year to get 185 days, which he considers a “starting point” to get yet another raise in the next contract.
Making Higher Education a Promise for the Future
The bus stopped at Gettysburg College with a long whistle.
12-year-old Graciela Rodriguez descends from it and blinks for a moment at the sight of the white columns, brick facades and green lawns.
Graciela’s parents had only been able to finish high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Also, while she and other Grade 8 (4th) students in the group explored Gettysburg where tuition is $38,690 per year, her attitude was less that of an impressed than enthusiastic new student.
"That's where I'm going to study!" exclaimed Graciela, who wished to study medicine, as the guide directed them to the entrance of the science building.
She said thoughtfully, when she was told of the low ratio of law professor to student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that the children visited during their three-day discovery journey and now they had fully integrated the message: The question is not whether you are going to college:
The question is where.
While this question still largely arises for the large number of U.S. children born to Hispanic immigrant parents who dropped out of high school where they became parents in their teens, there are also hundreds of thousands who benefit from university education that will allow them to enter the middle class.
In fact, "one in five 'second generation' Hispanics continue their high school education -- a notable achievement considering that so many of their immigrant parents, most from Mexico or Central America, entered the United States without completing high school.
Their success is important, the researchers say, paving the way for future generations to play an important role in the country's workforce.
Researchers who study battants claim that they have a natural affinity with school and an innate need to succeed.
There are also many whose parents set high goals for their children and who find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
Mentoring programs also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to college -- especially if her efforts are regular and long-term.
When you look at children from low-income families with parents who don’t have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention, at any time, won’t help them,” said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at Davis, University of California, who studied Latin American students.
We need to think about providing a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded the Graciela University visit is a good example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems to organize college readiness programs that begin when students from low-income families are in middle school and continue until the end of high school years.
Since 1999, the program has been attended by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent entering college, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraq’s oil ministry secures deals with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has managed to lure major oil companies to rebuild its troubled infrastructure during two auctions that ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil with foreign oil companies suggest that oil companies from China, Russia and Europe are about to play a major role in the rehabilitation of Iraq’s oil industry, crippled by decades of war and sanctions.
U.S. companies left with a stake in only two of the 10 fields auctioned.
Seven U.S. companies had paid to participate in the second auction that began Friday.
The only one who put up a bid lost.
Two U.S. companies won contracts for the fields auctioned in June.
The low representation of American oil giants in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors, after six years of war, and instead of American companies, Asian and European companies are leading the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an Internet news site.
It will take a long time before another offer is made in Iraq.
Security concerns, corroborated by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability as U.S. military troops pull back have held back U.S. oil companies, preventing them from more forcefully entering Iraq, which has the world’s third-largest crude oil reserve, analysts say.
U.S. companies were, in some cases, disadvantaged because of their rivals, particularly the Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, whose labor costs were significantly lower and who were more willing to take risks because they did not have to report to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies to obtain contracts with the Department.
The most important American companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which maintained strong ties with the Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum and provided it with technical advice, left empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The state-owned Chinese National Petroleum Corp. has bid more on contracts than other companies and left with large stakes in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological power, said Assam Jihad, spokesman for the Ministry of Oil.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be on an equal footing with its competitors and will fulfill its commitments in Iraq.
The companies pre-selected to submit bids made bids that were then compared to the rate per barrel that the department agreed to pay to motivate production above current levels for each field.
One of al-Qaida's top organizers was reportedly killed in Pakistan
A U.S. missile that struck along the border with Afghanistan appears to have killed one of the organizers of al-Qaida operations this week, U.S. counterintelligence officials said Friday.
If confirmed, it would be the second deadly attack on one of the terrorist leaders this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men suspected of being killed by a pair of missiles fired at their car on Tuesday near the town of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province, according to U.S. and Pakistani sources in the region.
Local authorities claimed the missiles were fired by an unmanned aircraft of the type used by the CIA, inside Pakistan’s anarchic tribal border.
They were driving a white car, heading towards the Afghan border, when the car was hit, said a member of Pakistan’s civilian secret service, speaking on Miran Shah’s phone.
Officials said the suspected local activists rushed to the scene and quickly confiscated what remained of the “totally shredded bodies.”
It was totally impossible for local authorities to verify the identity of the victims, but the two U.S. counterterrorism officials gave unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as one of al-Qaida's senior military organizers who directed the group's terrorist operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
His role was to organize plots around the world, said one of the authorities who wished to remain anonymous, citing the sensitive nature of the airstrikes inside Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this probably included conspiracies of attacks against the United States and Europe.
He followed the strategic instructions of al-Qaida leaders and translated them into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second U.S. official said Somali had made rapid progress in the ranks of al-Qaida and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be known to the American public at large, but it does not diminish the threat it poses to us and our allies, the second official said.
If confirmed dead, Somali would be the second major al-Qaida figure or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a faction of militants in the tribal belt, along with three other operatives.
The pace of attacks carried out by CIA drones has declined since the summer, from about six operations a month to two, according to figures provided by the Long War Journal, a website moderated by a non-profit group.
The decline may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups that have progressed to diminish their vulnerability while also ruthlessly killing suspected informants, the site says.
U.N. envoy in Kabul withdraws
U.N. special envoy to Afghanistan Kai Eide said Friday he would step down from his post in March, ending a tumultuous term marred by allegations of widespread corruption during U.N.-backed presidential elections.
Eide’s departure comes as the Obama administration has decided to send an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan.
The U.N. envoy said he supported the increase but expressed concern about the U.S. timetable for a troop withdrawal that would begin in 18 months and force other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the right signal to the Afghans and remind them that they can have confidence in the international community, Eide said in a phone interview in Kabul.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international officials assisting the political transition in Afghanistan.
The military increase must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide said he is not resigning but will simply honour the commitment he made to his family in March to spend just two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to warn the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows that he has time to find a replacement.
"I just said it was better to start looking for my replacement," Eide said.
When I came here, there had been a gap of two months between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban has already begun to look for a replacement.
The representatives said that the name Staffan di Mistura had been mentioned; he was an Italian-Swiss citizen who had recently chaired a United Nations mission in Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who had previously led United Nations peacekeeping operations.
Eide's reputation in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai during presidential elections and concealing evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied the allegations, but said Galbraith's accusations "harmed the mission because there was already a good deal of skepticism about international election observation."
Eide said he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the relief efforts of U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged UN officials to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries than is assigned to the mission in Afghanistan, saying it would give them more confidence about how their money is being spent.
Eide expressed frustration over the limits of his powers in Afghanistan, saying the UN's heavy hiring regulations hampered his ability to bring in new talent.
The UN rules are such that I have only been able to recruit one person since May, he said.
It's catastrophic and it can't last.
Gates: Iran must face additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that major world powers would soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because of its inability to engage in talks on nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking to an audience of 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq during a week-long visit to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, played down the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There are no good options in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier's question about the possibility of such a denouement.
One of the things that weighs the most on me is that if I've learned one thing in Iraq in the last six years, it's the unpredictable side of war.
The Obama administration is considering a set of sanctions that would target Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates noted that some of those sanctions could also affect Iranians on the street.
He said that a “set of motivations and punishments” might be needed to persuade the Iranian government that it would in fact be less secure with nuclear weapons” because “its people would suffer tremendously” from these sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders in warning that Iran will face “probable” consequences if it does not bring its nuclear program back into full compliance with the UN Security Council and its watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Iran insists that it wants to develop its nuclear experiment solely for peaceful purposes.
In the Geneva talks on October 1, he said he would resume dialogue on reducing his nuclear program and agree to give up a significant portion of his enriched uranium storage in exchange for desperately needed fuel for a medical research reactor.
The administration pushed for such an agreement as a way to build confidence on both sides and buy time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran appears to have moved away from attempts at a deal — in part, experts say, because Iran’s leadership is divided over whether or not to engage with the United States.
Frankly, in my view, Iran's stiffening in the face of some of the proposals of the international community that they had actually agreed to in early October, has pushed the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, to come together on what they had not considered, in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians," Gates said.
President Obama has set December 31 as the deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals, before it turns to other options, including pursuing what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called “increased sanctions.”
In a statement Thursday in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what it called "baseless allegations" by some members of the Security Council about Iran's nuclear activities and said it agreed to continue talks with the United States and five other major world powers "in order to achieve a satisfactory long-term solution."
Gates, who was due to return to Washington late Friday, met Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in the morning before flying to the oil-rich Kurdish region to meet with Troop Leaders in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
Tensions persist between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly over borders, property rights and income sharing.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential conflict to avoid any delays in U.S. plans to reduce the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
US officials quoted Gates as telling Massoud Barzani, President of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a unified Iraq."
We will not abandon you.”
In aging China, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters lecturing them, “Mother Earth is too tired to take in more children” and “An extra baby is an extra grave.”
They learned the lesson so well that the Shanghai government authorities, alarmed by their city's inadequate birth rate and aging population, changed direction radically this summer and began encouraging young couples to have more than one child; their reaction was instant and firm: never.
We have already given all our time and energy to one child.
“We don’t have a second left,” said Wang, 31, a director of human resources who has an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, creating two generations of single children notoriously with good cheeks and spoiled, nicknamed the "little emperors", a population crisis threatens the country.
According to the UN, the average birth rate fell from 1.8 children per couple to six when the policy was implemented.
The distribution of the population, while it is expected that the number of residents aged 60 and over will explode, from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050. This figure is well above the overall average of about 20 percent.
This imbalance is even worse in wealthy coastal cities with highly educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 percent of the population of registered residents in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission, said fertile couples must have babies in order to “help reduce the proportion of the aging population and prevent a shortage of labor in the future.”
Shanghai is about to become “as old – but not as rich, however – as developed countries such as Japan and Sweden,” she said.
Progressive Mitigation
Written into the country's constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is to this day, without question, the most controversial obligation introduced by the communist government.
Couples who violate this policy may face huge fines -- up to three times their annual income -- and discrimination in the workplace.
The Chinese authorities have assigned the police a duty to help the country avoid a trend dangerous to its natural resources, while human rights lawyers have denounced abuses in the execution of this policy.
In rural areas, some officials forced pregnant women with a second child to have abortions.
In addition, many couples have resorted to selective abortions leading to an abnormally high boy-girl ratio.
In recent years, the authorities responsible for the population have gradually softened their position on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they granted more exceptions to the rule -- including for city residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which men and women are already single children -- and in 2007, they softened many of their harsh slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at Peking University, said central government officials recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one partner is an only child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time, posters urging families to have only one child were replaced by copies of regulations detailing who has the right to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city government has dispatched family planners and volunteers to meet couples at their homes and slip flyers under their doors.
He also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who would like to have more than one child.
According to the head of family planning, the response was disappointing.
Disappointing response
Although officials in a rural city on the outskirts of Shanghai say they have seen an increase in requests for records from couples wishing for a second child after the campaign's launch, the more urban district reported that there was no change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, still receives only four to five applications per month.
Shanghai officials, disappointed, say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city, in 2010, is still expected to be only about 165,000 -- slightly higher than 2009 but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee in Shanghai’s Caolu municipality, said financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don’t want to have more children.
They want to provide for their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally allowed to do so.
But like many Chinese, they only have the minimum health insurance and life insurance given by the government.
Without social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
Westerners mistakenly view the one-child policy as a rights issue, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple’s first child.
It's true, we're being robbed of the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not just the law.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons to explain their hesitation.
Wang, Human Resources Manager, said she only wanted one child because she was one herself. "We were the center of the family and used to have everyone take care of us."
We’re not used to taking care of someone else and we really don’t want to take care of others.”
Chen Zijian, 42, owner of a translation company says it more bluntly.
For middle-class couples who lower the birth rate, he says, you have to be selfish to succeed.
People in their 20s and 30s grew up watching their parents fight back in the early days of capitalist China and don’t want to have that lifestyle themselves, he says.
Even a single child takes a lot of time from his parents, he says.
A mother must give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are the space problems -- "You need to change your apartment" -- and the planning -- "When your child is only 9 months old, you need to write his resume to get a place in the best kindergarten."
Most of his friends are ready for this experience once, Chen says, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to benefit from a higher standard of living, he says.
We don’t want to make too many sacrifices.
The United Nations Group has draft plans for reducing emissions
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- characterized so far by disorganized assignments and mutual recriminations -- returned to the limelight on Friday, due to the release of a document outlining ambitious greenhouse gas reductions over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations shouldering most of the burden, in the coming days.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles, as much as it illuminated the way forward.
But it has been seen as a major breakthrough in the time-consuming negotiations, with more than 100 leaders from around the world arriving in Copenhagen next week.
Drafted by a UN special working group, the text does not say how much rich countries would give to the poor to support global warming, in the short and long term.
And it offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how developed and emerging new economies could reduce their carbon production and what would be the upper limit of global temperature rise that policymakers would be willing to tolerate.
It gives a lot of flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, Washington representative of the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who wrote six pages of the document, studied a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what U.N. Executive Secretary-General on climate change Yvo de Boer described as the “full picture.”
It shows the guidelines for a possible agreement in which industrial nations would collectively reduce their emissions in 2020 by 25 to 45 percent from 1990 levels, while major developing countries, over the same period, would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent.
Together, countries would reduce emissions by between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union also relaunched negotiations on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the impact of climate change -- to withstand floods and drought or to avoid deforestation.
However, on Friday, the same verbal altercations occurred, which have dominated the negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, the U.S. climate negotiator, rejected any discussion that would force industrialized countries to cut greenhouse gases, compared with voluntary efforts by major emerging economies if they were not funded by developed countries.
This change is a signal that the Obama administration is getting tougher on China than the Bush administration was two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without efforts and actions by major developing countries, Stern said, also regretting that the text does not insist enough to ensure that the reductions could be verified by outside observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after Chinese Vice Foreign Minister He Yafei said the US chief negotiator either lacked “common sense” or was “extremely irresponsible” for saying earlier in the week that the US would not financially help China fight global warming.
With the future economic trajectories of major world powers at stake, flaws have emerged both within the Third World and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is more about rescuing individual economies than rescuing the planet, with China and the United States quarreling over their respective obligations as poorer nations insist that the two dozen most influential countries ignore the scientific imperatives to act more courageously.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it was not surprising that major powers were fighting over who should bear the costs of cutting greenhouse gases, even though vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempt to hold major emitters accountable for their actions.
It’s really a game in which a new economic hegemony is developed, said Ulate, who is also Climate Advisor for Mexico and Central America for Conservation International.
Some of those countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change said they would continue to push for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most major participants said negotiations would lead to a political agreement at a minimum.
The 43-member Alliance of Small Island States drafted a 24-page treaty proposal early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, head of the European Commission's climate unit, said that the action of small island states has "put political pressure on the entire political process", in part by what they are now unified and calling on emerging economies such as China and India to act.
Debates became an urgent matter, as delegates focused on the fact that they had to resolve most of the outstanding issues before heads of government could reach agreement.
High-level officials such as the Indian Environment Minister, Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Vice-Minister got off their plane and rushed into the Bella Center building to attend closed-door meetings and briefings, so that they could make claims that will be investigated over the next week.
The real picture of the gathering -- in which 13,000 people enter and leave the Palais des Congr<0xC3><0xA8>s every day -- of guitar-playing activists presenting nightly shows mocking countries that they believe betray each other and that proposals are written and distributed on paper rather than by email -- is a real challenge.
The intensity is only increasing: almost all the important ministers are here and no later than Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
“We are entering the court of greats,” said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president for global policy at Conservation International.
The heavyweights are coming.
In Britain, the first train at 225 km/h will redefine Monday’s syndrome
At 5:13 a.m. on Monday morning, a whistle will blow through the night to signal the departure of a train that will mark a transport revolution in Britain.
The country’s first high-speed commuter train will reach 225 km/h, while it will run from Ashford, Kent, to London St Pancras, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, will be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes aboard the first Javelin commuter train outside London.
He hopes the new service will allow Britain to integrate an international network of fast and reliable trains and will connect the major conurbations of the Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
The little holes lost will become thriving suburban cities, business travel times will be much shorter, and switching from airplane and car to train will reduce national carbon emissions while reducing traffic jams on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties adhere to this project.
But the <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion needed to build a new rail network, the inevitable planning battle and fears of environmental dangers are likely to put the brakes on Britain’s high-speed lines.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company set up in January to produce a feasibility report for the government, will return its document to Lord Adonis on December 30.
This will allow him to obtain a detailed map of the route of the next stage planned for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn within five metres of the urban area and sites where the impact on the environment may be controversial.
In the countryside, the plan will be drawn up to 25 meters from the final route.
It is also expected that HS2 will present three options for a larger, northerly high-speed network.
Lord Adonis will answer in the spring.
Preferred options are highlighted in a Y configuration for which a high-speed line will go to the West Midlands.
The line will split in two at or near Birmingham, with one branch going westward from the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another going northeastward to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line will cross Scotland.
"It looks like it will be the best performance option," said a rail professional.
When this is finished, the travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first branch, which will not open until 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to an hour-long journey currently.
The proposals will allow the train to travel at 400km/h, making the UK network the fastest in the world.
The initial layout is designed to allow trains of 400m in length and capable of carrying 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can run on a London - Birmingham route.
A terminal capable of accommodating 20,000 passengers per hour would be required.
Given the space constraints, it is expected that an existing station will be enlarged to accommodate the high-speed network.
Rail industry experts state that only St Pancras International or Euston offer this possibility.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he thinks the project should go ahead, but longer public consultations and planning procedures mean a final decision will not be made before a general election.
Even if he starts the machine, the network will have to be built part by part.
Trains will first be forced to run off high-speed lines on existing rail north of Birmingham, retaining travel times between London and Scotland of more than three hours.
This solution seems to be the best to ensure a transition from planes to trains, constituting a reference point for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers repay <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 loan for Tory orangery
Alan Duncan, a leading Tory MP, has made the taxpayer pay thousands of pounds a year to reimburse the cost of an orangery he built in his home in his riding.
The party official who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that members of parliament were “maintained” increased his loan by <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 to build an oak extension to his second home in Rutland.
He had been allowed to charge the additional interest, amounting to hundreds of pounds a month, to the taxpayer.
Commons authorities received the complaints at the time and were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who carries out a review of members' spending. Last night Duncan said the complaints could not be "clearer or simpler".
Duncan, one of the wealthiest members of parliament, owns a two-storey house in a village in his riding of Rutland-Melton.
The neighbouring houses were sold for nearly a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the emoluments office says Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a veranda to the house, describing it in his plans as an orange grove.
The neighbors describe it as a "veranda for pleasure".
Mr. Duncan was not asked to explain the increase in borrowing during a recent investigation by the Commons Privileges and Standards Committee into his pre-borrowing provisions.
The Committee cleared him last month of any charges of non-compliance, following an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr Duncan changed the legal certainty of borrowing <0xC2><0xA3>271,406 from his London property to his constituency house which he bought in 1991, the year before he became a Member of Parliament.
Documents released this week show Mr Duncan was claiming around <0xC2><0xA3>1,400 per month in borrowing interest until March last year.
In April, its claims increased by more than <0xC2><0xA3>1,800 per month.
The interest rate on Duncan's RBS loan was not changed at that time, suggesting that all the increases were intended to finance the GBP 75,000 loan.
The standard RBS variable interest rate rose from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March this year, without moving since then.
The latest publication by the Commons authorities shows that Duncan continued to ask for <0xC2><0xA3>1,250 in May.
Duncan lost his position as Shadow Chief of Staff in September after an undercover reporter allegedly filmed him saying members of parliament had to survive “on budget” after the spending scandal.
"Actually, it's national now, you have to live 'on budget' and you're treated like 'shit.'
He said: “I spent my money on my garden and asked for a small part, based on what was right.
I could have asked for more, but I didn’t.”
The member of parliament, a millionaire from his former position as an oil trader, began having to explain his expenses in May after it emerged that he had asked for thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the fees bureau that this "could be considered excessive".
An activist dug a <0xC2><0xA3>-shaped hole in Mr Duncan's lawn, to protest after it was revealed that he had asked for <0xC2><0xA3>4,000 for three years.
Asked about the loan increase last night, Duncan said: “It was for capital improvements, approved both by the fee office and then by Legg.”
He added: "There's no problem with stealing or making or using the rules or anything.
It was quite clear, in the rules, allowed, etc.
It couldn’t have been clearer or simpler.”
Faithful, come all see the Advent calendar of Brighton
Brighton beach cabins have found a new way of promotion for the winter months, an interactive Advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their cabins for each December day, using Christmas carols as the theme.
The event began on December 1, when visitors were allowed to visit the last booth, from 5:30 to 6:30 p.m., each day, with p<0xC3><0xA2>tés and hot wine served free of charge.
The Christmas carols chosen so far include "I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Noel", for which the booth features the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an unpaid priest from the Diocese of Chichester and Director of Beyond.
He said: “We want religion to be closer to people in a post-Christian society.
"As a Church, why do we wait for people to enter a strange old building? It seems to me that the Church should get closer to people and celebrate in a more captivating way.
“The idea for the beach cabin’s Advent calendar came right after a conversation with a few friends over dinner.
Brighton is such a creative and vibrant place and we try to experience and represent that through spirituality.”
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world for the climate
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on fighting global warming, across the world and in Copenhagen, where police made several hundred arrests.
At least 30,000 people, according to police, about 100,000 according to organizers, marched in the cold in the Danish capital, on the sidelines of the United Nations Climate Conference, tasked with reaching an agreement by Friday that can enter into force on January 1, 2013.
Connie Hedegaard, the Danish chair of the climate conference, said the growing global climate mobilisation, illustrated by the demonstrations, had helped to make the “political price” of failure in Copenhagen very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital occurred shortly after the procession left, when a group of 300 protesters, dressed entirely in black, smashed windows with cobblestones and hammers, an AFP journalist said.
Riot policemen immediately intervened unceremoniously.
In total, the police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, mainly members of the "Black Blocs", these ultra-violent groups that had notably illustrated themselves at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
The coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, denounced the conditions in which hundreds of activists were arrested "without distinction", noting that about a hundred of them "were still held in the street Saturday night "handcuffed and kept in a sitting position despite the extreme cold".
Party of Parliament, the procession, rather good child, took the direction of the Bella Center, site of the negotiations.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building, without trying to enter it.
A stage had been set to welcome the planned speakers, before a candlelight vigil with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
The majority of the demonstrators had come by bus and train from major cities in Europe, but many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in sky blue raincoats, had formed a first gathering in Copenhagen in the morning at the call of the Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue tides" for "climate justice".
Today, we take to the streets to demand reparations for the ecological debt in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can not continue to say: we have time, estimated the Beninese singer Angélique Kidjo.
There are rivers that dry up in Africa, rivers where you can walk like you've never walked before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalization movement has moved closer to environmental organizations.
The French MEP José Bové, a figure of altermondialism, explained that he came to Copenhagen to "link climate justice and social justice": "Today, there is no gap between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world".
The Asia-Pacific region, home to many islands particularly vulnerable to warming, had kicked off the protests.
Some 50,000 people, according to organizers, had taken to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, marched in red, wearing bandanas touting solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, but also in Canada, rallies of a few hundred protesters also held to demand strong action against climate change.
In France, the events organized by the "350" network brought together a few hundred people, notably in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
In Geneva a few dozen people gathered.
Separatist Abkhazia elected its president, Georgia denounces a "farce"
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, just over a year after Moscow recognized Georgia's pro-Russian breakaway region, while Tbilisi denounced a "farce".
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in this first election after the August 2008 Russo-Georgian War for control of South Ossetia, another Georgian secessionist territory recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 17:00 GMT.
The turnout was 58 percent a few hours before the closure, according to officials of the Abkhaz Election Commission.
The first provisional results were to be announced on the night of Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including outgoing President Sergei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which has condemned the holding of the election.
This election is a farce.
For his part, Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili "regrets that Abkhazia has fallen under the total occupation of Russia," his spokesman Manana Manjgaladze said.
Apart from Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it as part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After separating from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, which left several thousand dead, Abkhazia seeks to show through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a step in our new life, our new era as an independent state, said Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, who said she voted for Bagapch.
She was among the voters who went to the polling station in a school in Sukhumi, the capital, in a pretty white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The issue of Russian domination is at the heart of the presidential election in this region with its sumptuous landscapes, on the shores of the Black Sea.
Vast billboards showing Mr Bagapch alongside Russian President and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin are installed throughout this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the west of the country, the head of the district, Beslan Archba, gave a warm welcome to Russian officials who had come to monitor the election.
We, the Abkhaz people, are grateful, he said in a small ceremony, referring to Moscow's support, especially the decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, replied Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian parliament, raising a glass of vodka.
For its part, the opposition represented by former Vice President Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticizes the agreements reached with Moscow last year, such as the one ceding control over the Abkhaz railways to Russia for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, says he does not support either the current government or the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is required to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round must be held within two weeks.
Climate: protests around the world, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people marched around the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement at the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where police on the alert arrested nearly 700 people on the sidelines of a massive demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to the police, a hundred thousand according to the organizers, marched in the cold afternoon in the Danish capital, which hosts until December 18 delegates from 193 countries, looking for an agreement that must enter into force on January 1, 2013.
Party of Parliament, the procession, generally good child, took the direction of the Bella Center, where the negotiations take place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the center, without trying to enter.
A stage had been set to welcome the planned speakers, before a candlelight vigil with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
Moments after the procession left, a group of a few hundred protesters, dressed entirely in black, armed with bricks and hammers, smashed windows, an AFP journalist said.
Riot police immediately surrounded them and intervened unceremoniously, throwing several of them to the ground.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, specifying that they were mainly members of the "Black Blocs", these ultra-violent groups that had notably illustrated themselves at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
In the late afternoon, a police officer was injured in the jaw by a cobblestone and four cars burned near a squat in incidents that led to the arrest of about 20 people, according to police.
We have our eyes on the extremist groups, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen had warned, while the helicopters of the security forces were turning in the sky.
The majority of the demonstrators, who came by bus and train from major cities in Germany, London, Amsterdam and Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in sky blue raincoats, had formed a first gathering in Copenhagen in the morning at the call of the Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue tides" for "climate justice".
Today, we take to the streets to demand reparations for the ecological debt in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

The French MEP José Bové, a figure of altermondialism, told AFP that he came to Copenhagen to "link climate justice and social justice": "Today, there is no gap between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world".
Oxfam mobilized several personalities, including the Danish model Helena Christensen, the former UN Commissioner for Refugees Mary Robinson, who were to address the crowd.
The Asia-Pacific region, home to many islands particularly vulnerable to warming, had kicked off the protests.
Some 50,000 people, according to organizers, had taken to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, demonstrated, dressed in red and wearing bandanas touting solar energy in front of the city hall of the Philippine capital.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, rallies of a few hundred protesters also took place to call for action on climate change.
In France, the events organized by the "350" network brought together a few hundred people, notably in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
In Geneva a few dozen people gathered.
The geo-history comes out strengthened from the reform of the general high school, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education Luc Chatel said in an interview to be published in the JDD Sunday that history and geography came out "reinforced" from the reform of the general high school, despite the removal of their compulsory education in scientific terminal.
From now on, all first-year students will have four hours a week and the same program for a shared common culture, says Chatel.
For the minister, "it is necessary to get out of the hypocrisy" because, according to him, "the S sector is no longer a scientific sector" but "in short, it concentrates the best students".
The ES and L sectors cannot remain sub-sectors of the S, he continues, stressing again: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals indignant at the absence of history-geography in the terminal in the technological high schools".
On Saturday, an Ifop poll published in L'Humanité revealed that nearly seven out of ten French (69%) disapprove of the government's plan to abolish compulsory education in history-geography in Terminal S. Many intellectuals and teachers have also criticized this suppression, as well as the left and some right-wing elected officials.
On the other hand, the minister added that there was "no question" of removing the philosophy of the S terminal program.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and unions) called for a day of mobilization on Tuesday to protest against the project, which according to them sacrifices the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), they will pass at the beginning of the year an eligibility test that will focus on their discipline, then at the end of the year an admission test that will focus on their ability to teach, explained the minister.
They will also follow internships in situations during the year of M2 and will be a first year in front of the students as trainee teachers.
If you add up all the internships offered before the competition, you already get more presence in front of the students, more than 300 hours, he continued.
Finally, the minister indicates that he will propose "the individual right to training, something that does not exist in national education".
It also reaffirms the plan to remove the school card "by 2012".
In Normale Sup, experts have 15 minutes to convince on the climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about the challenges of the Copenhagen summit: this is the challenge taken up Saturday morning by Jean Jouzel, vice-president of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) invited by the Ecole Normale Supérieure de la rue d'Ulm.
Jean Jouzel, also a Nobel Peace Prize winner, inaugurated the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a day consisting of a series of 15-minute speeches by experts, filmed and open to the public, an AFP journalist said.
We wanted to do something that catches people and makes them want to know more, explained on the sidelines of the conference Edouard Hannezo, 22 years old, one of the organizers of this day that takes its name from the one given by the students to the fish of the school basin.
About 20 speakers are chosen from among the experts of their discipline and they are selected for their charismatic side, he said.
On global warming, "we can talk about hours, but we can also talk about key objectives in a few minutes," said Jean Jouzel, who spoke without notes, but using graphics, in front of about fifty people.
This is part of our role as a scientist, he stressed, hoping that listeners will remember that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an extremely serious scientific issue".
Videos from these conferences will be posted on the school's website from December 15.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February, followed by others at a bimonthly pace.
Delays in payments: anger of prison guards, planned actions
The unions of prison supervisors on Friday called for "general mobilization" to demand the payment by the end-of-year holidays of bonuses and overtime whose payment was postponed to January for budgetary reasons.
FO-penitentiary (2nd union of supervisors) asked the staff who will not be in service to demonstrate Tuesday morning in front of the penitentiary institutions and to "block" them, to "denounce the theft of their dues".
The CGT-penitentiary (3rd trade union of the profession) calls on them to "meet in general assemblies in the different prisons for a strong mobilization", deeming "shameful and unacceptable" the non-payment in December of the "overtime, night bonuses, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the first union of supervisors, the Federal Autonomous Penitentiary Union (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for general mobilization (...) to raise discontent and anger".
The Directorate of Prison Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that overtime has increased a lot in 2009 and not all of it has been budgeted, but assure that the remaining hours will be paid in January.
The Chancellery said at the end of the day that Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the unions of supervisors guaranteeing that this payment would be made next month.
I am aware of the efforts made by the staff to operate and modernize our prison system, the Minister of Justice wrote in this letter.
I have asked the prison administration to put in place without delay a set of measures to ensure that this situation resulting from a miscalculation of the number of overtime hours does not happen again in the future, adds Alliot-Marie.
The December pay will therefore be meager, except for management personnel benefiting from the famous bonuses of functions and objectives, deplored the Ufap / Unsa, for whom "budget constraints have good back".
It is a pure scandal, outraged the interregional union FO of Marseille, announcing its decision to boycott until further notice "all meetings and convocations".
The staff will not come to work on their Sundays and holidays if those of October are not regularized in December, the same for overtime, also threatens FO Rh<0xC3><0xB4>ne-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when we are increasing our tasks and our missions without increasing our staff, it is more than regrettable to dare to attack the staff, says the CGT-Penitentiary of Bordeaux.
According to the unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, with some less well-off than others.
But in any case the account is not there, noted the secretary general of the Ufap, Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says he's offering "nicer stuff" than he's getting
U.S. President Barack Obama, who is about to spend his first family Christmas at the White House, told small-screen "pope" Oprah Winfrey that he had a simple rule when it comes to gifts: "I give things that are nicer than the ones I receive."
As part of a special program that will air Sunday night on ABC, the president and his wife Michelle offer a glimpse of how they plan to celebrate the holidays in their new and prestigious home.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family will be part.
Santa also likes Bo, Michelle Obama said, adding that the dog would "of course" have a gift, according to excerpts of the program broadcast in advance.
And Michelle Obama has been at odds with her husband’s claims about the quality of the gifts he receives: “Certainly not, I gave you nice gifts last year,” she teased the president.
Absolutely, he was forced to concede before replying with humor pointing to the First Lady’s pearl necklace: “Who gave you that?”
During this one-hour show, with the famous host who was a fervent supporter of Barack Obama during the presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favorite gifts as children.
Barack Obama talked about a ten-speed bike, but also a basketball that his Kenyan father rarely saw offered him at Christmas.
“I remember this time when I met my father who came to see us for Christmas and he gave me a basketball,” the president said.
It wasn’t until much later in my life that I realized that it was he who had given me this ball.
The First Lady remembered her side of her dollhouse.
I really didn’t know how to organize a house so I had lined up all the furniture against the wall, rather than arranging it around the fireplace, but I loved this little dollhouse,” said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday Re-Operated, RTL Claims He's in an Artificial Coma
Johnny Hallyday was re-operated in Los Angeles due to significant "injuries" after an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his entourage, while RTL claims that the singer was placed in an artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was re-operated overnight Wednesday to Thursday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after American doctors found "lesions resulting from the operation" of the herniated disc suffered in Paris on November 26, its press service said in Paris, specifying that these injuries had "required a restorative operation."
The singer's press service, however, wanted to reassure that the situation was "under control", while announcing that a new medical bulletin would be communicated at the latest in 48 hours.
According to RTL, partner of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday was however plunged into an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications".
It is only in 48 hours that we will have a little more certainty about the state of the patient when he has opened an eye, adds RTL.
Asked by AFP, the press service neither confirmed nor commented on the information.
RTL also claims that “according to some sources” no drain was laid after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had undergone surgery at the international clinic in Parc Monceau for this herniated disc.
The intervention, scheduled for several days, had been practiced by the neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor in the artistic world.
It was not available Thursday night to comment on RTL's information.
Following the operation he performed on Johnny Hallyday, the singer was hospitalized Monday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, for an infection following the intervention.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, said Thursday on RTL that his friend was going through "a bad time", but assured himself "no worries" for the rocker, who is "a fighter".
He had called me just before he left for Los Angeles, and I told him it was bullshit because flying twelve hours after such an operation is not playable, Mitchell said.
On Wednesday night, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, wanted to reassure, saying that Johnny Hallyday "responded satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection was "suffocated".
Camus also said he had spoken to Laeticia, the singer's wife, and had not noticed any particular concern.
But the singer's health problems have only increased since July when he was hospitalized for nine days following a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, to everyone’s surprise, Johnny Hallyday revealed that he had been operated on with a “small colon cancer” and then a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed as planned his long "Tour 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem has been widely commented on, with fans and journalists noticing the singer’s difficulty in getting around on stage.
In mid-November, his entourage even had to deny a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/small basin: Bousquet's first on his fetish distance
The Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, triple medalist at the 2009 World Championships in large pool, won Thursday an international title on a distance that he particularly loves, the 50 m freestyle, during the Euro-2009 in small pool in Istanbul.
The first day of this competition where combinations are allowed for the last time saw only three world records beaten while waiting for a flood.
One was improved by Hungary's Evelyn Verraszto on 200 m4 and the other two by Russia in the men's 4x50 m4 relay.
A regret for Bousquet, who peered at the world record of the 50 m freestyle, of which he holds the mark in the large basin (20.94).
On one of the two distances queens of swimming, the 50 m free, it is the 28-year-old Frenchman who won in 20 seconds 53 in a final where ten swimmers took the start against eight usually, a first internationally.
Bousquet beat Croatia's Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russia's Sergey Fesikov (20.84) but failed to lower the world record (20.30) as he had envisioned.
We can always dream better and in this case, I said that if the world record was within my reach, I would try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all of the swimmers were wearing polyurethane suits, which will be banned from January 1.
These combinations, which have set 238 world records since February 2008, end their epic journey in Istanbul, which hosted the first in 1999, during the same competition.
The use of the wetsuits did not serve this time to the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in the big pool this summer in Rome, world records to the key.
The young swimmer did not manage to lower the mark he holds on 400 m freestyle (3:32.77) but nevertheless won by signing the second best time of his career (3:34.55), ahead of the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn’t give it my all on this race.
I knew I couldn’t beat a world record this time but I managed to defend my title and I accomplished my mission.
Lobintsev will be a serious rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
U.S.: Zola’s sarcophagus panel awarded $1.5 million
A Roman sarcophagus panel that belonged to French writer Emile Zola was auctioned Thursday for $1.5 million, well above its estimate, art dealer Sotheby's said.
This front panel, two meters long and 63 cm high, dating from the 3rd century A.D., was estimated at between 150,000 and 250,000 dollars.
The marble "representing four Dionysian scenes in a sophisticated architectural setting, surrounded by satyrs and bacchantes, is a rare piece, there are only four or five of them in the world," Florent Heintz, vice president of art auctions of Roman and Egyptian antiquity at Sotheby's, told AFP on Tuesday.
It was sold among a hundred lots.
The sale is still ongoing but this lot is certainly the one on which buyers have bid the most so far, said a Sotheby's spokesman, Dan Abernethy.
The discovery of the acquisition of this marble by Emile Zola dates back to a few days.
The panel remained almost 300 years in Rome in the famous collection of the Borghese family, then appeared successively in the French actress Cécile Sorel, who had made it an element of her bathtub in her Parisian mansion, and in Paul Reynaud, minister under the Third Republic in France and briefly president of the Council before the accession to power of Marshal Pétain.
There was a shadow zone of about fifty years.
While searching the database of the Louvre Museum, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of a "succession Emile Zola" opened in 1903, one year after the death of the author of "Therese Raquin" and the fresco of "Rougon-Macquart".
Attempted aborted departure of Zelaya from Honduras to Mexico
Mexico said on Thursday that conditions were no longer met for the transfer to its territory of the ousted president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, who was denied safe conduct by the putschist government.
For the moment, after a late-night phone conversation with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that the possibilities of achieving this transfer are not met, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
Arrived in El Salvador on Wednesday to return Mr. Zelaya, the Mexican government plane returned to its place of origin, according to a source from the Directorate General of Migration.
The putschist government wanted to force Mr. Zelaya to "resign" and apply for political asylum abroad to grant him safe conduct.
But the ousted president refused, because he wanted to go to Mexico as a visiting acting head of state.
The putschist government "has experienced a new failure in wanting me to give up my position (...), they wanted me to resign," Zelaya told Globo radio on Thursday, on which he has often spoken since the beginning of the political crisis that has lasted for five months in the Central American country.
I can stay here ten years, here I have my guitar, added the fallen president, who has been a refugee at the Brazilian Embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months, playing a few chords.
The Mexican embassy has presented us with a request for safe conduct, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain a request for asylum, said Wednesday the Interior Minister of the putschist government, Oscar Raul Matute, to the Honduran radio HRN.
“I don’t ask any country for asylum,” Zelaya said in an interview with Telesur, which is based in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras will have to be made as president of the Honduran people, he stressed.
Rumors of Zelaya's departure on Wednesday had mobilized supporters of the ousted president, who came to gather around the Brazilian embassy, where the military has strengthened their headquarters.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the position of the putschist government.
This demonstrates the marginality of this government vis-<0xC3><0xA0>-vis international standards, he said.
Zelaya, who had approached Venezuelan socialist President Hugo Chavez, was overthrown on June 28, the day he held a popular consultation to prepare for his re-election, against the advice of the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
Exiled to Costa Rica, he had returned by surprise on September 21 and had taken refuge at the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be arrested for the crime of "high treason" which the justice accuses him of, according to the putschist government.
Putschist President Roberto Micheletti managed to organize a presidential election on November 29 to replace Mr. Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was elected during the controversial election recognized by the United States but disputed by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted overwhelmingly against Zelaya’s return to power until the end of his term on Jan. 27.
Wall Street Rises, U.S. Trade Balance Fuels Optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended up on Thursday, with U.S. trade balance figures showing the recovery of activity from both the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones rose 0.67% and the Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points, and the technology-dominant Nasdaq advanced 7.13 points to 2,190.06 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index was down 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1,102.35 points.
There is good news coming from different parts of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
But this remains anecdotal, she tempered, believing that the market was focused on "half-full glass".
Peter Cardillo, of Avalon Partners, said investors focused mainly on U.S. trade balance figures, "which show that activity is improving in the fourth quarter."
The U.S. trade deficit fell 7.6 percent in October from September to $32.9 billion.
Analysts had expected the deficit to widen.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The big news is the growth in trade volumes, especially for goods exports, which reflects the growth in the economies of the U.S.'s major trading partners, said Christopher Cornell, of the research firm Economy.com.
In contrast, new U.S. unemployment registrations rose against all odds last week to reach 474,000 applications.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers "has fallen to its lowest level in a year," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has declined.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury bill rose to 3.482% from 3.423% on Tuesday night and that of the 30-year bond to 4.492% against 4.408% the day before.
Cuba: Hundreds of supporters of power stare down the "Ladies in White"
A few hundred supporters of the Cuban government on Thursday defamed wives of political detainees gathered in Havana for World Human Rights Day, and prevented another demonstration for which a dozen dissidents were arrested.
About 40 "Ladies in White", wives or relatives of political prisoners, were killed in the street by supporters of Raul Castro's government as they marched to the center of the capital to demand the release of political prisoners, an AFP journalist said.
Down the Yankees!, "mercenaries!", "the street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Long live Fidel and Raul!" chanted, fist raised, the supporters of power to the dissidents.
They were escorted by plainclothes officers who had come to "ensure their protection".
The day before, a similar demonstration had taken place against the "Ladies in White" in Havana, without any injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana district of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also preparing to demonstrate on Thursday for the international day of human rights were arrested by plainclothes police, an AFP journalist said.
The police forced dissidents into civilian vehicles that were scuttled by government supporters, according to the journalist.
Arrests of dissidents in similar circumstances usually last only a few hours.
Recipients of the 2005 Sakharov Prize of the European Parliament, the "Ladies in White" had organized an unauthorized march to "demand the release of all political prisoners", 200 of them according to the dissent, said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Hector Maceda is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Maceda is part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of whom remain behind bars.
The Cuban authorities consider the opponents as "mercenaries" or "agents" in the pay of their declared enemy, the United States.
Very rarely, Cuban television reported on Thursday’s demonstration of pro-government activists against “counter-revolutionaries.”
Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European and American NGOs of violating rights and freedoms, including expression.
A man kills an octogenarian with a knife and injures 5 in Clichy-la-Garenne
A gunman armed with two knives killed an octogenarian and wounded five other people in the city center of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine), at an hour of affluence, Thursday at the end of the day.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the attacker, 28 years old, allegedly struck with two knives and for unspecified reasons, an octogenarian, in or in front of a pharmacy at 85 boulevard Jean-Jaur<0xC3><0xA8>s, we learned from police sources and from witnesses.
Severely injured, the old man, born in 1929 according to an official of the Alliance police union, died in hospital as a result of his injuries.
In or in front of this same pharmacy, he then attacked a couple, whose wife was pregnant.
The husband, in his thirties, stepped in and was injured.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were admitted to the hospital where the octogenarian died.
The days of the other wounded are in danger, with vital organs apparently affected, according to police sources.
The pregnant woman then became unwell and was reportedly hospitalized "in a state of shock", according to a police source.
The gunman, who appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, then fled into the street, still Boulevard Jean Jaur<0xC3><0xA8>s.
He allegedly injured two passers-by, apparently at random: a thirty-year-old man and a forty-year-old man, the latter seriously.
The script was confusing in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher knives that he carried cross behind his back, explained on the spot an official of the union Alliance in the Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passers-by, including young people, according to testimonies collected by AFP, have tried to control the man.
I saw a guy in his 30s with a green jacket.
Three young men tried to intercept him.
They didn’t get there because the guy was tough, said Alberto, a waiter at a nearby bar.
A crowd fell on him, including a municipal police officer who broke his wrist, he added.
Also Boulevard Jean-Jaur<0xC3><0xA8>s, at the height of No. 61, two municipal police officers, including their manager, tried to stop the armed man and were wounded with fists, according to police sources.
The events occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are many shops.
Passers-by came to tell me there was a wounded person outside.
I went out, I saw a 70-year-old person on the ground, I put him in a safe position, and I saw a very important wound to the abdomen, told AFP Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, a second person in his thirties arrived, wounded with a knife.
National police officers arrested the man, who did not have any identity papers.
The Nanterre prosecutor's office seized the investigation from the department of judicial police of Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
The man was hospitalized Thursday night.
He had not yet been heard in custody.
A police source has not ruled out that he is being held in a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, it took six policemen to control him at the Clichy police station where he was taken.
He was "in a state of overexcitement" as "all the brutes of this species whose forces increase tenfold under the effect of action".
Polanski's lawyer again calls for dropping lawsuits
The lawyer of the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski demanded again Thursday in Los Angeles (California, western United States), the abandonment of the lawsuit against his client, currently under house arrest in Switzerland for a case of more than 30 years of morality.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer for the "Pianist" director, told three California Second District Court of Appeals judges that there were serious procedural errors at the time of the events in 1977.
“I am calling for the charges to be dropped here and now,” Hummel said, adding that the conduct of the judge in charge of the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, “was cold in the back.”
According to him, Judge Rittenband, who has since died, had discussions before handing down his sentence with a prosecutor who told him that Roman Polanski deserved prison, which is a serious procedural error.
This discussion had been revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired", from the very mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells had finally declared at the end of September to have "lied" to the author of the documentary.
In the event that the court refused to drop the charges, Mr. Hummel requested a trial, which would allow him to present the evidence in his case.
The prosecution, for its part, reiterated the argument already developed in the first instance, namely that no dismissal of the charges could be seriously considered until Roman Polanski appeared before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978, before his sentence was handed down, for “illegal sexual relations” with a 13-year-old girl.
He has never set foot in the United States since.
Los Angeles County Assistant District Attorney Phyllis Asayama said Roman Polanski “must be there to appear at the hearing.”
In this case, do we want to send the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, that it is possible to escape?
For her, the filmmaker "asks the court for a favor, while scorning its authority".
One of the three judges -- who now have 90 days to render their decision -- also stressed "that there were other alternatives to the escape."
Mr. Hummel was not alone in calling for the abandonment of the prosecution of Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer’s lawyer, the victim, has also called, once again, for an end to the prosecution.
Recalling that her client can no longer bear to be harassed at every turn of the Polanski case, she added: "No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough.”
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland on an American arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was placed under house arrest in his Gstaad chalet, awaiting possible extradition.
Wall Street ends directionless, held back by rising dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended without direction on Friday, in a market torn between better-than-expected indicators in the United States and the rise of the dollar: the Dow Jones gained 0.63% but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while the technology-dominant Nasdaq dropped 0.55 point to 2,190.31 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 Index rose 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver, of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains within narrow margins, the volume of trade has become very low and I think that will remain the case until the end of the year.
The trend was supported by the release of better-than-expected economic indicators, which “helped improve market sentiment about the strength of the economic recovery,” analysts at Charles Schwab summarized.
In the U.S., retail sales rose 1.3% in November for the second month in a row and far more than expected.
U.S. consumer confidence also rebounded sharply in December to 73.4 from 67.4 the previous month, according to the University of Michigan's preliminary index estimate.
The indexes, however, were held back by a new rise in the dollar, the highest in two months against the euro, which "pushes down the sectors sensitive to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
Technological values have thus lost ground.
The bond market has declined.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury bill rose to 3.540% from 3.482% on Wednesday night and that of the 30-year bond to 4.497% from 4.492% the day before.
The election of Miss World again in South Africa
After a month-long journey through South Africa, the 112 candidates for the title of Miss World are preparing to cross Saturday the last straight to achieve their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion viewers.
During this great beauty mass organized for the second year in a row in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already won their ticket to the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were elected Miss Sports or Miss top model during their African stay.
It was a real whirlwind.
Visiting beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town was extraordinary.
“I have seen so much and experienced so much!” exclaims Miss Sierra Leone.
This competition, which takes place for the ninth time in South Africa, is broadcast live Saturday from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, starting at 17:00 (15:00 GMT).
I couldn't dream of a better country to put my crown back on.
This experience has been fascinating.
“I am happy to have experienced it twice,” said Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by many exchanges with the candidates and the rediscovery of "breathtaking landscapes in this country".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, press meetings and safari, the Misses are now focusing on competition.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000 and present at this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both of whom have become Bollywood stars.
It’s every woman’s dream to be crowned the most beautiful woman in the world, but it’s not just about appearance.
“We are the ambassadors of our countries and I want to go home with the crown,” said Miss India with a broad smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will punctuate this 59th edition.
The candidates will parade in traditional costume and of course in swimsuit.
The show will be hosted by Chinese TV presenter Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and Miss World committee official Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it knows how to welcome the world with a warmth and pride that is hard to match, says Julia Morley, president of Miss World.
The candidates have like last year made a safari, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time by bike, and tasted the local cuisine.
They also met with South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook their hands.
Not common for a head of state, notes Miss Sierra Leone.
Their fondest memory will undoubtedly remain the draw in Cape Town (southwest) for the June 2010 World Cup, a way for the country to further promote the event.
I've been hanging out with people I never thought I'd be able to get close to.
I will definitely come back for the World-2010, enthused Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
News of Johnny Hallyday 'very positive', says son David
The news of Johnny Hallyday "are very positive", assured Friday his son David on his arrival at the airport of Los Angeles where he had to go to the bedside of his father hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, it is going very well, David Hallyday told the press on his departure from the plane that brought him from Paris shortly after 13:00 local (21:00 GMT).
The singer's son, who looks relaxed, said he would travel "very quickly" to Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted Monday for an infection following the operation of a herniated disc on November 26 in Paris.
The singer was "placed in an artificial coma last night in Los Angeles for reasons of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and to be able to administer his treatment," the press service said.
Johnny Hallyday had previously been placed in an artificial coma by doctors at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was admitted Monday for an infection following the operation of a herniated disc on November 26 in Paris.
The singer had to be reoperated in the night from Wednesday to Thursday due to significant injuries resulting from this intervention.
His wife Laeticia went Friday morning to the French high school in Los Angeles where their daughter Jade is attending a school show, an AFP photographer said.
The head of orthopedic and trauma surgery at the Pitié-Salp<0xC3><0xAA>tri<0xC3><0xA8>re hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would travel Monday to Los Angeles with the singer.
The producer violently questioned Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated on the singer on November 26 at the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
The Los Angeles surgeons said they were outraged, Camus said.
I have heard of a possible legal proceeding to come, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus said that Johnny Hallyday had left "far too quickly for Los Angeles, with the permission of the Parisian surgeon".
I had this in-person doctor online who assured me that there was no problem for this trip and it amazed me, given that I myself had two herniated discs, he added.
Shortly before on RTL, he had indicated that the singer had apparently "left without a drain, without anything", after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the art world.
He had operated on actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before her death, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where he was practicing at the time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to resorb a hematoma following a cerebral hemorrhage.
But he is also a doctor with a sulphurous reputation, condemned several times by the courts, in medical liability cases, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, the lawyer of the Order of Doctors, accused him of being "an unscrupulous man" prosecuted "regularly" before the Council of the Order, and who is "far from recommendable".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
He said the surgery went "perfectly well" and that post-operative examinations were "normal".
The operation "was not hemorrhagic and therefore did not require the laying of a drain," he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems are multiplying since this summer, seems in parentheses.
Obviously, a resumption of the tour on Jan. 8 as planned seems very short, Camus said.
The UDF association raises the tone and sums up the New Center to no longer use its acronym
The UDF association, controlled by the MoDem of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou, reacted on Friday to the bid attempt of the president of the New Center, Hervé Morin, on the acronym of the former party Giscard, by warning him not to use it on any support, or legal proceedings.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the UDF logo, saying that Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou did not deserve to defend his political legacy after reaching out to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had planned to confirm this strategy Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
To support his approach, he received the support of MP Hervé de Charette (ex-UMP passed to the NC) who claims ownership of the UDF brand for having been the first to file it in 2004 at the National Institute of Industrial Property.
But on Friday evening, the office of the UDF association, controlled by Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou's friends who do not intend to let themselves be dispossessed, came out of its silence to issue a formal notice to the minister and the deputy, urging them to stop using the acronym and to pass on the ownership of the brand to them, under penalty of legal proceedings.
In recent days, you have multiplied the statements indicating that you were going to propose to your political movement to "retake" the UDF acronym, the association wrote in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez of the MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Arthuis of the centrist Alliance.
You also thought it would be a good idea to include the name of this movement, the "New Centre", of the slogan "Today's UDF", on your militant material and on the front page of your website, as well as the signatories of the letter.
As you are not unaware, you have no right to use this acronym, explains the UDF office which demands the NC to remove "immediately the mention of the name of the UDF from any medium as well as from (its) website".
He also asked Hervé de Charette "to pass on the ownership of the trademark to its rightful owners".
If you do not, the courts would be seized to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, warn the signatories.
In their letter, they specify that the UDF "has been a political movement in its own right since 1978" and recall that Mr. Morin and his friends had "made the choice" to leave it in 2007 "to create a competing movement, as others had done in 2002, to create the UMP".
The New Centre therefore has no right to use the acronym UDF (Union pour la démocratie fran<0xC3><0xA7>aise).
They also recall that the last congress of the UDF voted in 2007 its adhesion to the MoDem for three years and the creation of an office in charge of defending "the material and moral interests" of the formation founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the bureau continues, "when he filed the trademark", he was "no longer a member of the UDF for three years", but at the UMP.
He scandalously and fraudulently takes advantage of the absence of deposit of the acronym UDF to carry it out on his behalf.
This indelicacy is turning into a crime, they denounce, before mocking the strategy of the NC: "It seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make a name for oneself than to try to get out of anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which one is not entitled".
Liliane Bettencourt case: Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness
The court of Nanterre decided Friday to judge the artist Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier in order to determine, if, as the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt accuses, he took advantage of a state of weakness of the octogenarian for the spoil of part of his fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his photos of stars, will be tried on April 15 and 16, 2010 for abuse of weakness, an offense punishable by a maximum of three years in prison and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will indeed be a trial in this case worthy of a saga about one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter tear each other apart while holding the reins of the L'Oréal cosmetics empire.
But the 15th correctional chamber also ordered that an 87-year-old medical examination of Liliane Bettencourt should be conducted jointly by three doctors.
The heir and main shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to submit to such an examination, at least not under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre prosecutor's office during the investigation.
The doctors appointed on Friday will have to submit a report before March 10, 2010 saying in particular if Liliane Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness and at what periods.
I think she will submit to it.
I'll tell him about it," said Ms. Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman.
For her part, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Bettencourt-Meyers' lawyer, Olivier Metzner, welcomed the court's decision.
This is excellent news (...) The expertise will show that he (Mr. Banier) manipulated this elderly lady that we must protect, he said.
For the past two years, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter has filed criminal charges against photographer and artist Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier, whom she accuses of taking advantage of her mother's weakness for years to obtain a billion euros in donations, in the form of checks, life insurance contracts or paintings by masters.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt has always denied having been manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers a long-time friend.
While the court was expected to consider the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers' lawsuit, the lawyers' pleadings sometimes turned to the big family unpacking on Friday.
Thus, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer reported three letters sent by her client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary, in which she said to be suspicious of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In the letter dated 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "could you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for fifteen years.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise, I have never been able to speak to her since her wedding."
For its part, the Nanterre public prosecutor's office once again considered that the complainant was not admissible to take action, especially since a guardianship judge had refused in recent days to grant her request to open judicial protection proceedings for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to act in court, she is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one else has to act in his place," said the representative of the public prosecutor, Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
The court finally decided that it would rule once the trial had taken place on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers.
The managerial revolution or the end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of large French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence will have been in vain...
For more than ten years, the attitude of the management of large companies towards its employees, recalls the position of companies towards consumers before the marketing revolution: it is a question of making employees adhere to determined "values" from above as it was formerly, to impose on consumers products designed by the technicians of the factory.
By putting the customer at the heart of the company, the marketing revolution has put the strategies of conquering markets back where they belong... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products that are disconnected from customer preference factors comes back regularly!
Demobilization of employees can lead to deadly demoralization.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the emerging part of a much more general phenomenon that affects executives in particular.
This demobilization seriously undermines the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, including R&D and, even more so, economic intelligence.
Indeed, EI "requires all stakeholders (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision"; it requires from employees a commitment that the revenues of authoritarian management totally contradict.
This is why we call for a managerial revolution that would put employees at the center of the company’s concerns on the same level as the customer.
The Relative Utility of Internal Opinion Surveys
Will internal opinion surveys – such as the questionnaire Orange submitted to its employees – incite this revolution in managerial practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
- First because I could see that, faced with a new situation, any structure finally arrives, after many detours, to do first... what it has always done.!
- Then, because authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power - grows in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most leaders have a simplistic view of human behavior.
Coming from the great engineering schools, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, for intellectual comfort, the old behaviorist theory, recently reactivated by the US "neurosciences" and widely disseminated, without their knowledge, by the institutes of studies and the media.
Thus, by suggesting that it is possible to handle the "levers" (sic) of executive engagement, a recent Ipsos survey published in Le Figaro.fr strengthens leaders in a position of mechanistic governance, unsuitable for today's world.
Identifying and Measuring Mobilization Factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern companies requires adopting a finalist vision of human behavior.
It consists in integrating, in any reasoning or governance practice, a fundamental observation: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it clearly appears as a means to achieve part of their dreams, their ambitions, their projects.
Currently, only studies from the Motive Analysis adopt this conception of employee motivations.
These studies have shown that they judge their company based on a predetermined doxa that allows them, through their perceived image of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to carry out their life projects.
Through the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, business leaders can monitor, predict and anticipate their “social performance” and put their human resource management “on the spot.”
They thus create a favorable terrain for the concerted development of a robust and efficient economic intelligence.
Oslo speech: ‘Just war’ worth right-wing praise to Obama
On Friday, the American right welcomed Barack Obama’s speech in Oslo the day before, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize had defended the concept of “just war” against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who tossed the award to Mr. Obama on October 9, applauded the presidential speech this time, as did Sarah Palin, a former vice-presidential candidate in the 2008 election.
"I liked what he said," Palin, who runs the Republican Party's right-wing, told USA Today, adding that she had addressed the issue of war "sometimes necessary" in her newly published memoirs.
War is, of course, the last thing I think Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
These terrorists must be stopped there, she said.
Obama, who inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, worked Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done "a very good job" in Oslo.
I thought the speech was really good, said the former speaker of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential speech.
On some sides, I found this speech quite historic, said Mr. Gingrich, interviewed on the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former elected official, considered by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said he was delighted to see "a leftist president" remind members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free and could not give a peace prize if the use of force did not exist."
For Michael Gerson, former pen of George W. Bush turned columnist at the Washington Post, Obama gave "a very American speech".
In addition to presenting himself as a "citizen of the world" as "he always does", "he spoke like an American president", reminding Europeans "that they live in a security bubble that they have not created and that they do not do much to preserve it", said Mr. Gerson.
Among the few on the right not to be convinced, a Bush-era hawk, former U.N. ambassador John Bolton, called the speech “tender, blistering and uninspired” on the National Review Online website.
To the left of the president, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justify the use of force.
When we wrap war in the notion of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocents, he warned.
The left-of-center press, however, continued to praise the president.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to think that the Nobel was awarded prematurely to Mr. Obama, called his speech a “superproduction” even for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo speech "should serve as a road map to guide international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression," the newspaper said.
Obama "made the right speech," the New York Times said, calling it "both dark and uplifting."
Road racers: three marathons for a deal that saves Christmas supplies
After three marathon sessions of negotiations, the unions of the road sector and TLF, the only employer organization to have remained until the end, reached an agreement on Friday evening that ends the slogan of strike and the threat weighing on Christmas supplies.
During the signing session Friday evening, the Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, "rejoiced" of this agreement, after several sessions of negotiations, which began Wednesday morning.
After a second night of talks, the negotiators left in the early morning hours on Friday, hoping to sign the text of the agreement early in the morning.
And this even if three employers’ organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) had slammed the door.
But it took even more than six hours of a meeting that started at 11 a.m. for everyone to agree and for the text to be signed at 6 p.m.
The conflict "would have been very damaging for companies" and "it was feared that it would disrupt the holidays at the end of the year," Bussereau said.
The text foresees an increase in wages of 4% for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport), and of 2.9% for the highest (international transport).
In hourly rates, for low wages, "we go from 8.72 euros to 9.06.
It's not a big deal, but we're starting from very far away, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
Either we will give the order to our militants that there are no blockades, no blockade of the supply centers.
But we can always have some recalcitrants who are not happy, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of TLF, welcomed "a good agreement", although it was "difficult to concede the increases on high wages given the international competition".
According to him, the increases will be of the order of 170 euros per month for the low salaries and 100 to 120 euros for the highest ones.
It is the agreement of common sense and respect for employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed "a historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) spoke of "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for the revalorization of travel expenses by 3%, and the holding of general road transport status in the first half of 2010, which will notably address the issue of a 13th month and a modernization of the collective agreement.
Mr. Bussereau recalled that "a reduction of 100 million euros in employer charges" was the subject of a government amendment to the draft amending finance law for 2009, voted on the night of Thursday to Friday by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate to vote on it "in identical terms".
The signing of TLF allows the agreement to be applied first to companies belonging to this organization, and secondly, to the entire profession, in case of extension by the Minister of Labour.
It will be done "as soon as possible", assured Mr. Bussereau.
The opposition of employers' organizations can only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced a "market of fools", because the 100 million euros "had already been promised to the sector to offset part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate urgently, not in conclusion of a shared analysis, but not to upset the turkey eaters of the next New Year's Eve, lamented Unostra.
The agreement risks “digging the grave of a very large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months”.
RER A: disruptions this weekend, unions unhappy with RATP proposals
Disruptions on the RER A, France's largest urban public transit line, will continue over the weekend, while a Friday meeting on the second day of a strike between unions and RATP leadership left them hungry for their premium claim.
Saturday and Sunday, for this important shopping weekend before Christmas, there will only be trains between 10:00 and 20:00, at the rate of one train in two on the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and one train in four outside the central section.
Interconnection with the SNCF will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, which will require passengers to change trains.
Galeries Lafayette, which expects 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that “RATP is making efforts to serve department stores.”
The RER A crosses from west to west is the Parisian agglomeration.
The RATP section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains ran during peak hours, and almost no trains in off-peak hours, as expected.
As on Thursday, there was no riot on the quays, the Franciliens having organized themselves.
Thus in the early morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less frequented than usual, especially because of the absence of high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer, explained that he got up "an hour and a half earlier, to be sure to arrive on time".
The Saint-Lazare station has not experienced saturation, said the SNCF, which had planned a supervision of agents and law enforcement.
The RER A operated by the SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from Saint-Lazare station to reach the metros.
New general assemblies of strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will examine the results, deemed "lean" by the unions, of a meeting with the leadership on Friday afternoon.
The ERN Director proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for RER A on all aspects, working time, career development, etc.
This is not what drivers want, who claim a premium due, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even puts its premium proposals in parentheses, the CGT was outraged, stressing that the management "was not screwed to solve a problem while at the truckers and the SNCF it is done".
A new meeting is scheduled for Monday for "a broader review of the conditions of practice of the profession," said the RATP.
This also made the unions say that the company "made fun of the weekend users".
In the morning, some 150 drivers had invaded an establishment committee at the headquarters in Paris.
It was then that the management, which until then refused any discussion during the strike, had suggested "for the sake of appeasement" the meeting.
The conflict threatens to widen at RER B on Tuesday, after the filing of a notice by Unsa and Independents.
The unions demand a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros of which 30 euros variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independents) and complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this line to the million daily travelers.
RER drivers, all in the second part of their career, receive from 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross as well as 600 to 650 euros of premiums, for off-hours, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish court dissolves pro-Kurdish party, decision fraught with consequences
Turkey’s Constitutional Court on Friday ruled to dissolve the country’s main pro-Kurdish party, a decision that was immediately followed by angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community, in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision risks greatly complicating the task of the government, which has just reached out to the Kurdish community in an attempt to end 25 years of conflict.
The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a “home for activities detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity,” Court President Hasim Kili<0xC3><0xA7> told reporters after four days of deliberations.
The decision was taken unanimously by the 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven votes was required to pronounce the dissolution, said Kili<0xC3><0xA7>, adding that 37 of the party's executives, including its president Ahmet T<0xC3><0xBC>rk and MP Aysel Tugluk, are banned from political life for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr. T<0xC3><0xBC>rk and Ms. Tugluk and the confiscation by the Treasury of party assets.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
Its leaders had warned before the verdict that MPs would leave Parliament rather than sit as unlabelled parliamentarians.
The decision follows a 2007 procedure launched by Court of Cassation prosecutor Abdurrahman Yal<0xC3><0xA7>inkaya, who accuses the DTP of obeying the "directives" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
The party says it has "no organic links" with the PKK but refuses to label it a terrorist organisation and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The court’s verdict comes as the government has just reached out to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen its rights, in an attempt to dry up Kurdish support for the PKK and end the conflict.
DTP leaders said a dissolution could lead to renewed tensions in southeast Anatolia, where many protests against the conditions of detention of PKK leader Abdullah <0xC3><0x96>calan have escalated into clashes with police in recent weeks.
As soon as the announcement of justice, a thousand demonstrators gathered in front of the DTP offices in Diyarbakir, the large city in the southeast populated mostly by Kurds.
Law enforcement fired tear gas and used water cannons, while protesters threw Molotov cocktails or stones, with slingshots.
About 100 people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, T<0xC3><0xBC>rk said the court ruling would “deepen despair.”
Turkey cannot solve this issue (Kurdish, ed) by banning a party, he told the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also deplored the decision.
We are opposed in principle to the closure of parties.
This does not solve anything, said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a total torpedoing of the democratic opening launched by the government, commented political analyst Ahmet Insel.
Of course, we can expect a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for an attack that killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the deadliest in recent months.
The first snow may fall
What Wolfgang Brauburger wants is a harsh winter.
But the head of the Road Clearance and Sandblasting Service (FES) makes it clear that this is not to annoy citizens.
This is simply so that the agents can test the technique of the vehicles and learn to master them well.
And according to the meterologists, it could be for this weekend.
More than 300 officers and 120 vehicles stand ready to tackle snow and ice.
The EDF follows a very elaborate plan here.
Mr. Brauburger explains that as soon as it starts snowing over the city of Frankfurt and temperatures drop below zero, large sandblasting vehicles run 20 main routes (referred to as Route A).
This includes the high-traffic streets, the main thoroughfares, such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
Also included are fire access, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and sloping streets such as Atzelbergstra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
The FES officers begin their service at three o'clock in the morning.
In case of need, the 1040 kilometers of road must be salted with a road fondant that adheres well, in 3 hours maximum time.
This is why the EDF service starts at 3 a.m. "so that the roads are cleared when the daily migration traffic begins".
Where it gets harder is when the snow starts to fall at 7:30 in the morning.
This poses problems, the head of the road clearing and sandblasting service tells us "because no motorist is willing to let the salting vehicles through".
Then, if it no longer snows, we take care of the access roads and service roads - such as the Rat-Beil-Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
Sideways and side streets come last.
Mr. Brauburger is well aware that this always causes some complaints.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES pedestrian team set off to clear the areas deemed dangerous and the passages as a priority.
As for cycle paths, EDF services are generally unable to take care of them.
Mr Brauburger pointed out that there was a special service in Frankfurt which monitored the condition of the bridges between 10 p.m. and 4.30 a.m.
As the ice forms very quickly on these surfaces, the salting vehicles intervene as soon as the temperature drops below 2 degrees.
It also happens that the police call on this special service in case of need.
The Cradle of Dinosaurs
The Tawa ellae resembled other carnivorous dinosaurs: this biped was about 2 meters long by 1.50m high, its hind limbs were powerful, its elongated skull was provided with sharp and curved teeth, its short arms ended in sickle claws and it had a long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would not have had anything exceptional.
But, as Sertling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and his colleagues report in Thursday’s Science magazine, the Tawa hallae is one of the first dinosaurs with these morphological features.
This animal lived 215 million years ago in New Mexico, which at the time was part of the land surface of the supercontinent, the Pangaea, and was located near the equator.
Sertling Nesbitt says the discovery of the Tawa sheds new light on the evolution of the first dinosaurs.
Indeed, it informs us about the kinship, the distribution and the characteristics of the latter.
In 2006, Sertling Nesbitt and other paleontologists began excavations at the Gohst Ranch site in northern New Mexico.
Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History and a member of the excavation team says that they sometimes found a dozen bones in a day, which is absolutely unique for a sedimentary layer dating from the Triassic.
Scientists soon realized that some of these bones belonged to a new species.
Excavations have uncovered the remains of five specimens.
A discovery that confirms theories about the beginnings of the evolution of dinosaurs.
The researchers named it Tawa after the Hopi word for the sun god.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is an exceptional discovery: dinosaur fossils from the Triassic are extremely rare and limited to a few fragments of incomplete bones.
Not all paleontology experts share this enthusiasm.
For example, Martin Sander of the University of Bonn does not find this discovery to be particularly spectacular, but he points out that it allows to confirm some theories about the beginnings of the evolution of dinosaurs.
According to the current state of knowledge, dinosaurs appeared on Earth about 230 million years ago.
Most of the oldest fossils, however, are fragmented and incomplete, making it very difficult to classify the very first dinosaurs.
Experts wonder, among other things, at what time the saurians divided into three major groups of evolution: the theropods (carnivores) which include the tyrannosaur and the velociraptor appeared later and from which the birds descend, the sauropods, quadrupeds with long necks, and those that are related to them and the herbivores ornithischians of which are part.
According to the studies of S. Nesbitt and his colleagues, the Tawa is one of the earliest theropods.
This species has an interesting relationship of both primitive and developed characteristics, says S. Nesbitt.
The researchers found clues suggesting that Tawa hablae had small air sacs in its bones at the level of the skull, just like the birds that are the descendants of theropods.
These small pockets of air make it easier for birds to breathe compared to mammals.
It appears that the vertebrae of the Tawa hallae have also been partially filled with air.
According to Randall Irmis, the Tawa is one of the oldest theropods with small air sacs in its bones.
Since the related lineage of the huge sauropods also possessed air sacs and a light frame, it can be thought that their common ancestor already had this beneficial innovation.
Three successive waves of migration to North America.
As the most primitive dinosaurs known lived in South America, researchers concluded that saurians had appeared there.
As a result, the three great lines of evolution split and spread from South America to the rest of the world, that is, the whole of the land that formed the supercontinent Pangaea.
This seems to be confirmed by the fact that the team of paleontologists also discovered the remains of two other theropods that are not particularly related to it.
The three species cannot be descended from a common ancestor that has migrated, the researchers say.
Alan Turner of the Natural History Museum in New York and co-author of Science Studies magazine says there would have been at least three waves of migration to North America.
There are of course some contradictions.
Martin Sander, a paleontologist in Bonn, says there is an even older species, the silesaurus, that lived in present-day Poland and belongs to a group related to dinosaurs.
According to him, this could give an erroneous view because there are in South America a large number of dinosaur fossils that have been preserved while practically none are found on other continents.
However, how dinosaurs managed to become the dominant tetrapod of the secondary era when they came from a relatively rare collateral line of the reptile branch remains a mystery today.
At the time of the Triassic, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of today's crocodiles and many other saurians.
Towards the end of the Triassic, the dinosaurs spread all over the planet, favoring the development of many new species while others, which were related to them, disappeared between the Triassic and the Jurassic.
Such success, however, is not eternal.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander sees two hypotheses.
There may have been a mass extinction in which dinosaurs survived randomly while other reptiles disappeared.
Or else, the dinosaurs were better suited and so they were able to eliminate the competition on the ground.
In any case, such success is not eternal.
150 million years later, the fall of a meteorite favored the development of a group of animals that had also developed during the Triassic and which since that time vegetated in the shade: they were mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and there are signatories from all over the world.
There are those of professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley in California.
There are those of lecturers from the University of Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police evacuation of the casino of the J.W. Goethe University in Frankfurt is making waves all over the planet.
278 professors and professors from J.W. Goethe University as well as other higher education institutions in Germany, Europe and North and South America express their solidarity with the protesting students of the Westend Campus.
In a statement in German and English, they condemned the police intervention called for by the university's steering committee.
Last week, University President Werner M<0xC3><0xBC>ller-Estler had buildings occupied by striking students and teachers evacuated after walls and artwork were smeared with graffiti.
Five students were injured in the evacuation.
The signatories believe that the damage did not justify "such a violent intervention by the police commando against the students and teachers who had organized their own courses".
The evacuation represents an "unacceptable infringement" on freedom of research and education.
Focusing attention exclusively on acts of vandalism only serves to “delegitimize and criminalize protest” and tries to make people forget the reasons for the mobilization.
The Steering Committee of the University has thus withdrawn from the debates that would be indispensable.
The lecturers demand that the criminal proceedings initiated be immediately suspended.
The majority of the occupants did not take part in the damage.
Legitimation of protests
The young people of the Verdi trade union in the service sector and the German Trade Union Confederation (DGB) show solidarity with the students.
The protests are only the legitimate expression of a growing concern for our own future, says Alexander Klein, regional youth secretary of the Verdi union.
As for the Minister of Science of the Land of Hesse Eva K<0xC3><0xBC>hne-H<0xC3><0xB6>rmann (CDU), she took the stand for the action taken by the President of the University and the police.
We thank the President of the University.
Any occupation and degradation of the premises is totally unacceptable, she told the regional parliament of Wiesbaden last Thursday during the television show Aktuelle Stunde.
We understand the meaning of the protests but do not accept vandalism, expressed the CDU deputy of the regional Parliament Peter Beuth.
The opposition SPD parliamentary groups, the Greens and the Left (die Linke) did not share this view.
The CSU is using a few painted walls to criminalize the protests, said Janine Wissler of the Left Party (Linke)
Instead of thinking about the arguments and demands of the students, we evacuate them.
The La Gauche party has tabled a motion calling on the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on the conditions of the police intervention.
The new "Silicon Valley"
For a long time it had the reputation of a secret city, forbidden to Western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was, under the Soviet regime, a place for the search for secret armaments, under strict surveillance.
Today with its 216,000 inhabitants 37 km from the center of Moscow, the municipality has the reputation of being the Soviet "Silicon Valley".
Important production and research sites in micro- and nanoelectronics are located there.
As early as September 2008, representatives from Zelenograd established links with Riedberg, the site of Frankfurt’s science centre – with the academic institutes and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were reciprocal meetings and last Wednesday representatives from Zelenograd and Riedberg ratified a “Protocol of Close Collaboration”.
The signatories were Moscow Deputy Mayor Juri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smimov of Zelenograd for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz project section head for Frankfurt.
In 2010 representatives of the FIZ and SMEs, whose strong point is scientific research, will go to Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
This is a sustainable scientific exchange.
But also economic relations.
It will allow FIZ companies to enter the expanding Russian market.
On the other hand, Russian scientific companies want to get contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of famous Soviet research institutes and societies.
There are the Moscow Institute of Electrical Engineering, the big firms Sitronics and Rosssijskaja-Elektronika.
The commune was founded in 1958 as a "planned socialist town" for arms research.
Zelenograd (literal translation “Green City”) takes its name from the wooded hills in the heart of which the research centers are located.
The S21 project: a brake for Stuttgart
The magnitude of the Stuttgart 21 project cannot be placed high enough.
For its supporters it is nothing less than “the new heart of Europe”.
S21 is much more than the burial of a railway station, more than a colossal construction project that will plunge the heart of the capital of Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg, in a desperate chaos of construction sites for about ten years.
Stuttgart 21 was born from the spirit of the 80s.
The head-of-the-line stations, with tracks that ended in the middle of the city, had the reputation at the time of being the relics of the transport technique of the nineteenth century that acted as a brake shoe of modern rail traffic because it used to take a long time to pass the locomotives from the rear to the front.
Arrival, short stop, departure – that’s what you have to do.
This is why the head-of-the-line stations must disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart too: a train station, which is located about halfway on the Trans-European Railway between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava hence the slogan "heart of Europe".
The realization of the S21 project will really begin, although the visions of the 80s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious planners recognized that the cost of burying the station in the respective capitals of Hesse and Bavaria was exorbitant.
In fact, head-of-the-line stations no longer pose any real entry and exit problems since there are modern, reversible trains with railcars and car-pilots at both ends.
However, the construction of Stuttgart 21 is now underway next to the new route of the inter-city line to Ulm.
Regional and municipal policies have prevailed.
The railway company is on the side because it is the taxpayer who bears the risks of the largest infrastructure project in the federal republic and not the public company.
From an urban point of view, this project is relatively well justified.
We get an urban space that – if we believe the graphs of the computer-generated planners – will be very green.
For the rail transport system, the S21 is harmful.
The crossing station and the expansion of the section are designed for human trafficking, which was - and is typical of the 1980s - a huge growth.
At that time there was no competition for cheap flights.
Modern traffic policy should first focus on strengthening freight traffic as rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than trucking on the road.
But the new layout, with its slopes, is not suitable for freight trains.
The S21, and this is much more serious indirectly concerns many other railway projects.
For example, six billion euros will be swallowed up in the Swabian project.
That's the official number.
Experts believe that ten to fifteen billion are more realistic.
One thing is for sure, in the next decade this money will be missing for other junction points and bottlenecks in the network.
The Ministry of Transport lists a total of 60 major projects.
One of the most important is the widening of the section through the Rhine valley by 180 good kilometres.
Since 1987 this line has been built in slow motion.
It would be really urgent to press the button here.
But the S21 project has the effect of a brake shoe.
The Rhine Valley route is becoming the bottleneck for international freight traffic in the heart of Europe.
The Government examines the judgment rendered on the airport
At the Regional Parliament in Wiesbaden, the Land Government referred to the possibility of appealing the judgment of the Hessen Administrative Court concerning the prohibition of night flights.
The Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the CDU/FDP coalition had instructed the experts to examine from the legal point of view the judgment rendered by the Administrative Tribunal, which is a document of more than 400 pages.
The Kassel Tribunal had justified in a written document that the Land should adapt the regulations concerning the prohibition of night flights in the event that the project for the construction of the runway northwest of Frankfurt Airport would come to fruition.
The authorization to land 17 aircraft between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m., as envisaged by the Land Government, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against night air nuisances.
The coalition must have decided by January 4 whether it wishes to appeal the judgment in cassation.
The opposition criticised the deadline and tried to pressure the government representative to appeal to the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The leader of the SPD parliamentary group, Torsten Sch<0xC3><0xA4>fer-G<0xC3><0xBC>mbel, calls on the CDU and the FDP to return to their pre-election promise to ban night flights, otherwise it will be dismissed as a total breach of a given word.
It is damn hard to be allowed to keep one's word, Greens leader Tarek Al-Wazir said, alluding to the FDP's election slogan "We keep our promises".
Minister Dieter Posch refutes Sch<0xC3><0xA4>fer-G<0xC3><0xBC>mbel's accusations that the Land government is still trying to allow night flights using "lawyering and robbing".
It takes time to conduct a thorough legal review.
The coalition does not want to make a decision on the basis of a "quick first impression".
The decision must be legally reliable, says Stefan M<0xC3><0xBC>ller (FDP).
The opposition's interpretation of his faction's statements on the night flight ban is completely wrong.
U.S. Banks Repay Aid Allocated
The big American banks, very affected by the crisis, are breaking their ties with the state.
Bank of America announced Wednesday that it had fully repaid to the Treasury $45 billion (more than 30 billion euros), corresponding to the aid granted under the Tarp rescue plan.
U.S. broadcaster CNBC said in a report that Citigroup was also considering repaying the aid received.
Banking institutions are thus seeking to get rid of the restrictions imposed, which accompanied the acceptance of sums, such as the limitation of bonuses attributed to managers as well as the payment of higher fees.
The Bank of America launched a capital increase by selling securities to investors that brought it $19 billion in fresh money.
The rest of the sum comes from the bank's coffers which are well filled thanks to the sale of several branches of other sectors.
Last Wednesday evening, Kenneth Lewis the Managing Director of the Bank of America expressly wanted to thank the American taxpayers: the injection of capital has helped considerably to overcome a difficult period.
The bank had assumed its capabilities by buying investment bank Merrill Lynch at the height of the financial turmoil.
Citigroup also plans to raise money on the financial markets in order to free itself from state control.
The U.S. bank could launch as early as Thursday a capital increase of $ 20 billion, reported CNBC citing the banking community.
The Citigroup spokesperson did not wish to comment on this information.
In June, the banks Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had repaid the public funds they had benefited from.
Expedited Election
In the end, it all happened faster than expected.
Just two weeks after the dismissal of the current editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender by the board of directors of the German broadcaster ZDF, the successor has already been appointed.
The committee wanted to vote last night to make the nomination.
Peter Frey, who runs the Berlin edition of ZDF, was the big favourite.
However, the channel did not want to confirm - officially - the vote so as not to anticipate the procedure.
However, it seems that there was also a desire not to further harm ZDF Intendant Markus Sch<0xC3><0xA4>chter in the event that the proposal was not accepted by the Board of Directors.
Frey, who is Sch<0xC3><0xA4>chter’s candidate, needed the vote of 9 out of 14 Commission members.
The result of the vote was not yet known at the close of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Sch<0xC3><0xA4>chter proposed to the Board of Directors to extend the contract of Nikolaus Brender by five years, but this was rejected.
Only 7 members of the Council had voted in favour of Brender's reappointment, and another 7 had voted against. Brender's dismissal by vote was a serious but predictable failure for Sch<0xC3><0xA4>chter.
Indeed, the CDU, which is the majority on the Board of Directors, had already hinted several weeks before the vote that it did not want to return Brender to his post.
It was Roland Koch, the Minister-President of the Land of Hesse, who organized a league against the editor-in-chief.
He had refused to extend the contract of the highly esteemed editor-in-chief on the grounds that the rate of listening to ZDF news broadcasts had fallen under Brender.
This is why protests were still taking place, almost until the vote, criticizing the growing political influence exerted on the ZDF.
In the end there were even 35 public law experts who had interfered in the debate and who felt that Koch’s way of acting was unconstitutional.
But it won't do any good.
Peter Frey: Who is he?
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied political science, pedagogy and Romance languages (Spanish).
He then worked at the S<0xC3><0xBC>dwestfunk (radio station in Rhineland-Palatinate) and the Frankfurter Rundschau (German national daily).
In 1983 he became editor of the ZDF, first of all in the news magazine "heute-journal" (today's newspaper).
From 1988 to 1990 he was deputy editor-in-chief at the time; then correspondent in Washington in 1991/1992, then and until 1998 he was head and presenter of the "Morgenmagazins" (a bimonthly morning news programme); until 2001 he was head of the foreign policy department of the ZDF and then head of the Berlin editorial board.
After Brender’s disgrace, when he had just been elected journalist of the year by the trade magazine Medium Magazin, the Greens announced that they would file a constitutional complaint.
Koch's opponent on the board of directors, Minister-President of Rhineland-Palatinate Kurt Beck, said last week that the L<0xC3><0xA4>nder should transform the ZDF's Intergovernmental Treaty so that the intendant's staff proposals cannot be blocked by a partial political majority.
Beck did not, however, consider calling for the withdrawal of political figures from the ZDF's supervisory committees.
Peter Frey, Brender's likely successor had skilfully maneuvered with the Board of Directors by vehemently criticizing the commission in its decision to fire Brender.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence, Sch<0xC3><0xA4>chter was able to propose him for the position of editor-in-chief without losing face, just as the Board of Directors could elect him without being suspected of placing a political supporter in the post.
In the arithmetic representations of the parties, Frey is classified as a left-liberal.
Great cleaning in university studies
Partial success for students: after a year of educational strike the L<0xC3><0xA4>nder Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs decided to be more conciliatory: at a meeting between the Ministers and the delegates of the Rectors' Conference, an agreement was reached stipulating that the working conditions of Bachelor or Master students should be improved.
In the future, students should be able to complete their studies.
In particular, they agreed to lighten the weight of the examinations: a single examination should make it possible to close the chosen study module.
In addition, the workload will need to be reconsidered to ensure "realistic and acceptable proportions".
Political authorities and higher education institutions wish to facilitate the recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
The L<0xC3><0xA4>nder have also committed themselves to organising more flexible common structural requirements for Bachelor's and Master's programmes.
At regional level, there must be no different regulation from one Land to another.
Fewer Exams
Since the beginning of the student protests last June, the L<0xC3><0xA4>nder's education ministers and university rectors have been constantly talking about the fashionable expression: "studiability".
But for the first time, this expression seems to take on a concrete meaning.
The Accreditation Council decided to considerably reduce the number of certain examinations: "Each module must normally be able to be concluded by a single examination", says a document of about thirty pages on the future conditions for admission to university cycles.
Reinhold Grimm, Chair of the Accreditation Board, said that by significantly reducing the burden of examinations, it should be possible to stop slippages, which were significantly detrimental to studyability.
In addition, "studyability" should be the decisive criterion for the organisation of studies in the future.
The modules as well as the background should be examined carefully to see if one can not avoid that feeling of suffocation that one sometimes feels in the choice of courses.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest RAID knowledge about Kunduz, the opposition believes that Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate deception.
Students should "have the opportunity and leeway necessary to enable and foster personal initiative."
The new regulations will cover access to new university cycles but will also be adapted to existing cycles.
These cycles must be "reaccredited" every 5 years, which means, however, that it will not be until 2015 that all cycles will have been reviewed.
There are 10 competent accreditation agencies throughout the federal territory that depend on the accreditation councils set up by the L<0xC3><0xA4>nder.
In October, the education ministers put some pressure on the L<0xC3><0xA4>nder to put pressure on the agencies so that the programmes are not too busy and the examinations are not too strict.
In some L<0xC3><0xA4>nder, universities and specialized colleges have already agreed with their regional ministries to take appropriate measures.
Rhineland-Palatinate is so far the only Land to have given its consent to grant more means to the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities must organize tutorial programs and strengthen the educational guidance offices as well as the examinations offices and the international relations department.
The L<0xC3><0xA4>nder and universities are planning a budget of EUR 10 million for this purpose.
In early 2010, the government wants to introduce an amendment to the Higher Education Institutions Act in Parliament.
After that, you will only have to pass one exam to complete your studies.
The organisation of studies should be more flexible, it should also be possible to guarantee the recognition of transcripts from other higher education institutions and access to the Master's programme should be simplified.
By the end of next year, the "studiability" of all university cycles will have had to be examined.
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition again debated the issue of study conditions in the country.
Decisions were appreciated, but criticism was voiced.
The Federal President of the Union of Socialist Students has indicated that he would like the organization of the educational policy no longer to happen in the future "behind closed doors" of Ministers and rectors of universities.
At the latest after the educational strike, students as affected persons should be able to express themselves a little.
Future graduates of higher education received the support of the President of the Rector's Conference (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: "the experience of the students is very useful to us", she said on Thursday during a meeting with the Ministers of Education of the L<0xC3><0xA4>nder with whom the HRK is working on a common reform project.
For the education and science union (GEW) the decisions taken in Bonn do not go far enough. It claims the right and the possibility for each graduate Bachelor to enroll in a Master's cycle.
Andreas Keller, a member of the GEW steering committee, is also calling for the L<0xC3><0xA4>nder to ensure that today's Bachelor students have enough places to study a Master's degree and that the study conditions are as good as possible.
The L<0xC3><0xA4>nder therefore need to hire more lecturers.
On the other hand, the Ministers of Education did not mention the possibility of reducing access to the Master.
More than a footnote on Herta M<0xC3><0xBC>ller
It is with these words "arrival in Germany and it is beautiful, almost more control..." that begins a work by the poet Werner S<0xC3><0xB6>llner, in which he thematizes in bits and pieces of disturbing sentences, the experiences of a dissident arrived in Germany who won freedom but at the same time lost his linguistic territory.
Werner S<0xC3><0xB6>llner, born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, was first a professor of German and English in Bucharest and later a collector in a youth publishing house before moving to Frankfurt am Main.
S<0xC3><0xB6>llner has received various literary awards; in 1993 he held the coveted chair of poetry at Goethe University in Frankfurt and since 2002 he has been director of the Hesse Literature Forum at Mousonturm's artist's house in Frankfurt.
He made a lot of mention of him in non-literary circles last Tuesday, during a congress in Munich, whose theme was "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the distorting mirror of your Securitate files".
Visibly destabilized and embarrassed, S<0xC3><0xB6>llner made a statement in which he acknowledged to his fellow German-Romanian writers such as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer that he had collaborated as an informant for the Securitate political police.
In 1989, S<0xC3><0xB6>llner received the German language award jointly with some of the participants.
Enlistment trials had begun insidiously in 1971.
I am, concludes S<0xC3><0xB6>llner, "so someone who has not been able to resist the attempts of intimidation of the Securitate".
The poet Werner S<0xC3><0xB6>llner is the informant Walter (IM Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the award of the Nobel Prize for Herta M<0xC3><0xBC>ller and his exemplary literary quarrels with the mechanisms of the power of the dictatorship, the literary scene is shaken and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, by a case that clearly shows the abyss and the baseness of a political system, based on police surveillance and espionage.
Werner S<0xC3><0xB6>llner is, as far as we can tell from current knowledge, not only guilty but also a victim.
In his own file Securitate, I.M. Walter played a role, assures literature scholar Michael Markel after S<0xC3><0xB6>llner's confession and he refers to the positive influence of I.M. Walter who had interceded in his favor.
“He was able to pull it out of all the difficult situations at the time,” Markel said.
Markel felt the moral need to make this comment.
The form in which S<0xC3><0xB6>llner made his statement and in front of this public was unexpected, however the admission of a former dissident of his collaboration with the Romanian secret services is in fact, not so surprising.
Germany is a pleasant reserve for Securitate spies, Herta M<0xC3><0xBC>ller wrote in July in the newspaper "Die Zeit", after reading the 914 pages of her own dossier.
It can be assumed that the victims have speculated and sometimes guessed what real names were hidden behind the names of Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Unlike Germany, where in the meantime the consultation of the Stasi files is a reliable process, the attitude towards the legacy of the Securitate files is still very confused.
A systematic clarification has been constantly thwarted and slowed down in the past years.
It was only in 1999 that a national council corresponding to the Birthler institution was created to work on the assimilation of the Securitate archives (CNSAS) but the restitution of the files has rather lagged since then.
Since 2005, there has been a law defining the management of archives.
That the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still very great, is confirmed by the interview of a former head of the Securitate of Temesvar who, after the announcement of the award of the Nobel Prize to Herta M<0xC3><0xBC>ller, expressed himself in a very disdainful way towards the winner.
She had a psychosis, and in the end she had only been questioned once.
The infamy of power thought it was possible to express itself here, without any gene, under the guise of freedom of expression.
Admittedly, many inescapable issues are associated with the S<0xC3><0xB6>llner case as so often occurs in a context of hidden guilt.
The weighted reaction of the listeners, according to S<0xC3><0xB6>llner, suggests that the rest of this chapter will be defined more by a thirst for knowledge than by accusations and a sense of shame.
On the genesis of the work of Herta M<0xC3><0xBC>ller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Champions League riots
It felt like a representative was arriving there, pinned straight from a nice Christmas party, on which the sporting goods manufacturer had spread its goods when the new VFB coach Christian Gross went up at midnight minus a quarter in a Mercedes C-class, which he had just called, an orange plastic bag from the supplier in his hand.
The man, whose bald head attracted attention, allowed himself to be led into the city that was still foreign to him.
Otherwise our 50-year-old could have taken the wheel himself – he hadn’t been drinking alcohol and he wasn’t drunk on happiness either.
It was a pleasant evening, but I had to go back to work tomorrow.
Because now it was about to start.
The words of Switzerland that we had just started three days earlier were clear: "We have well reached the eighth round", that is to say in the Champions League thanks to our 3:1 against Unirea Urziceni of Romania "but we must not be blinded by success. It will be a brutal fight not to fall".
The "big work" is waiting for us on Sunday.
There, it is a question of repeating in Mainz the results of the Champions League on a daily basis.
And it will be necessary to overcome the weaknesses that have resurfaced after the three quick goals of Marica (5.), Tr<0xC3><0xA4>sch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.)
Draw of lots
The Champions League round of 16 (one-way match 16./17. + 23./24 February/ return match 9./10. + 16./17. March) will be drawn on 18. December in Nyon.
The joy of Babbel’s successor’s fulminant inauguration was thus moderate.
And the joy was not moderated only in the one who had brought good luck, who had transmitted to the professionals of Stuttgart destabilized, a flawless motivation and the pleasure of playing.
I went to see the players and told them that they should focus on their strengths, I advised them to be more courageous, explained the "Leader of Souls" - Gross - the recipe for success that sounded so good that it no longer had any effect with the Babbel healer.
It triggered a certain magic, confesses Jens Lehmann - Babbel supporter -, "in football when there is a new impulse, sometimes things happen that one would never have thought possible".
And Sami Khedira who, after weeks of injury break, advanced to the rank of the best player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the "phenomenon" observed by a proverbial "fresh wind" and the working method of the new leader: "He is someone who takes action and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation.”
But apparently Babbel had missed it.
The VfB Stuttgart has not passed the course yet, warned the manager Horst Heldt
For the moment, VfB Stuttgart needs tenacity above all.
Just like Gross, the players and the manager are careful not to overestimate the victory against a totally outdated and weakened defense of the Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow before having a bad awakening four days later in Leverkusen with 0:4, Khedira objected.
Horst Heldt, the manager, reported that they had achieved one of the goals of the season but that there were others that were still far away.
We haven't crossed the difficult path yet.
That Heldt didn't have the heart to party on his 40th birthday, even after the first home win in three months, is due to the weekend events that a TV interview with goalkeeper Jens Lehmann bounced off just before the game began.
There are decisions that others make and not Jens, Heldt countered, in response to Lehmann’s acerbic criticism.
He had accused the direction of style weakness and said that she had decided to change coach under pressure from pubertal fans.
Lehmann had also judged it as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jealousy that his day off after the games had been removed.
Lehmann’s statements were “marked by pure selfishness,” Heldt went on to announce consequences for the goalkeeper.
They no longer risked becoming friends for life with these two forty-year-olds.
In any cast, they agreed with everything else, that is, without the previous work of the group by the replaced coach, strong sports and combative representation would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants were “largely successful” retorted Heldt and Lehmann in chorus – and even the man with the plastic bag acquiesced.
World Heavyweight Championship
Hot match in Bern: Kevin Johnson the challenger constantly challenged the world champion Vitali Klitschko verbally and gesturally.
But after twelve difficult rounds the Ukrainian defended his title of world heavyweight champion according to the WBC version.
Unanimously by the judges, he won the points.
Hamburg – Vitali Klitschko retains his title as world heavyweight champion.
The WBC federation announced that on Saturday night the 38-year-old champion had won a unanimous points victory against the American Kevin Johnson (120:10).
For the third time Klitschko has defended his title with honour since his comeback on stage in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian had already won the WBO and WBC World Championships twice.
Unfortunately, he did not succeed in the long-awaited knockout.
Klitschko, 39 times winner in 41 professional fights, had to admit twice his defeat due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept his first loss in the 24th fight.
In the Bern Arena, in front of 17,000 spectators, the great Klitschko especially wanted to dictate the fight, from the height of his 2.02 meters, by his counter-left.
Johnson, eleven centimeters smaller who, before the duel, had announced the end of the Klitschko era, managed to avoid the blows of the champion, thus preventing Klitschko to bring into play his dangerous right back.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, mostly tried to pass the rounds.
Although he continued to provoke Klitschko in words and gestures, his blows rarely reached the champion.
He is still the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in the year 2000, having exceeded with Klitschko the distance of the twelve rounds.
The challenger had made a lot of noise in the Swiss capital before the fight.
He insulted Klitschko calling him a "bad zombie" who "isn't really capable".
During Friday’s weigh-in, the champion couldn’t help but tease Johnson by dropping his sunglasses from his nose “so he could see his eyes.”
Fourth win since Klitschko's comeback.
Klitschko won again in his fourth fight since his comeback on October 11, 2008
After a break of almost four years, he had beaten at the time the Nigerien Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered "his" WBC belt that he had previously abandoned without a fight.
This year, defending his title of champion, he won the fight against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September against Chris Arreola of the USA.
“I just took a hit in that fight and I’m in great shape,” Klitschko said, explaining his quick return to the ring.
His dream is to try to bring together the four most important titles in the family.
His brother Wladimir is a champion of the WBO and IBF federations.
But it is the British David Haye who, having dethroned the great Nikolai Walujew - 2.13 meters - in November, wears the WBA belt.
This summer, Haye canceled a match against Vitali Klitschko that was scheduled to take place in September.
It seems that his promotion company is now planning to play this match at the Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz Affair
Frontal attack of the opposition: the leader of the Greens parliamentary group, J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Trittin, accused Defense Minister Guttenberg of lying in the case of the Kunduz Affair.
The SPD and the Left (die Linke) asked the Chancellor for explanations.
Hamburg/Berlin - After reviewing the latest information on the Kunduz airstrike, the opposition accused Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) of deliberately concealing certain facts.
The minister intentionally "formulated a falsehood" about the deadly strike of two tankers last September, said the head of the Greens parliamentary group, J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Trittin, Saturday during the news broadcast of the ARD channel "Tageschau" (the newspaper of 20h).
In other words, it means he lied.
The order to kill was given in complete disregard of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
That is, in essence, the content of the NATO report that was read by Mr. Guttenberg, Trittin said.
Last Friday, according to new media revelations, the aim of the strike was in reality not to destroy the stolen trucks, but to eliminate two important Taliban leaders.
According to the NATO investigation report, 142 people were killed or wounded in the US airstrike that was launched at the request of German Colonel Goerg Klein, Kunduz military commander.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left on Saturday urged Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak to the federal parliament as soon as possible and reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Trittin and his Green Party colleague Renate K<0xC3><0xBC>nast are of the opinion that Angela Merkel must make it clear whether the strategy of targeted killing is part of the Afghan policy of the Federal Government if the Chancellery, the army and the intelligence services have approved this new strategy.
The Government spokesman categorically rejects these criticisms.
The chancery has in no way influenced the army’s interventions in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there were growing voices expressing doubts about the real reasons for the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as presented by the ministry.
According to information from SPIEGEL, the information they had provided to Guttenberg regarding the attack on the tankers was both correct and complete.
Officially, they would have concealed the existence of the NATO report and hidden from the Minister some embarrassing details.
In the entourage of the two senior officials, however, it is suggested that they have informed the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein and a report by the military police.
The "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reported that Wichert had meanwhile asked in a letter for clarification of the facts.
So far, he has not received an answer.
On Saturday, the department declined to comment on the allegations and referred them to the federal parliament's inquiry committee, which was to be set up the following Wednesday to shed light on the facts.
The worlds of the dream
Some see, all awake, images and hear voices that no one else sees or hears.
It is not only in the mentally ill, or under the influence of drugs, that the limits between imagination and reality are confused.
As long as these phenomena occur during sleep, everything is fine.
When we are lying in our darkened rooms, we can indulge unhindered in the wildest dreams and fantasies.
However, the one who, awake, experiences the dream state, hears and sees things that others do not perceive, quickly has the reputation in our Western world to be crazy or drugged, or at least to be an original.
Such images and voices do not appear only in the mentally ill or under the influence of drugs.
It is our imagination that is at stake: it is the same neural activity that allows us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, but which sometimes incites the limits between dream, madness and reality to blend in.
A state of conscious awakening, taking the form of a dream, can present itself in the most diverse forms, at best it is called visions, at worst madness.
But even if the trigger and the effect stand out, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, the second states of shamans, psychoses and hallucinations are attributable to very similar processes.
There are hallucinations or delusions when the balance of the brain’s neurotransmitters – first and foremost dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and achetylcholine – breaks down and the interaction between different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts often occur during a schizophrenic psychosis.
The force of attraction of the earth no longer has power over the person.
Since ancient times, philosophers and doctors have always focused on the relationship between madness and dream.
For Aristotle, hallucinations were a form of daydreaming; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, noted in 1861 "a great resemblance between madness and dream", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis with all the irregularities, imaginations, delusions and sensory illusions that compose it".
It’s the fall of 2001 when Henning T transforms into a comic book character.
Its body is in two dimensions with garish colors.
The terrestrial attraction no longer has power over him, he hovers at the raz of the ceiling.
He feels a blow.
Behind him are winged, grimacing devil creatures, their mouths bleeding, showing their teeth.
They chase him, kick him with heavy flamboyant boots, throw him against the walls, he feels pain all over his body.
Loud, wicked voices, screaming, coming out of the walls and the radio.
He can no longer bear those voices that insult and humiliate him.
Henning T. rips two cables from his stereo, loops them and attaches them to a hook attached to the ceiling.
He climbs on a baffle and loops around his neck.
He jumps.
The loop comes off.
Let it be a lesson to you, shout the voices in a choir to rip out the eardrum. "Go to a clinic and get treated!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychoses, the last date of 2 years, the first of almost 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
The diagnosis: schizo-affective psychosis, paranoid, in addition he is manic-depressive, he takes medication for depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
During the psychosis I experienced terrible fears and deep despairs.
Illusions are a cruel reality.
About one percent of the population suffers at least once in their lifetime from schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics it is the most common disease after depression.
In a schizophrenia crisis, the people concerned can no longer tell the difference between the inner world and the outer world, they find themselves in a state of hyper arousal, which causes them to suffer from hallucinations, megalomania, relational madness or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices – voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are not uncommon either.
The person concerned can no longer distinguish between the important and the insignificant, the brain can no longer filter the disturbing signals, the conscious is drowned under the sensations.
Like dreams, psychosis opens the floodgates to a flood of ideas and fantasies from the deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is centered on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the department of psychiatry at the Heidelberg University Hospital (Allgemeine Psychiatrie im Universit<0xC3><0xA4>tsklinikum).
The schizophrenic is at the center of the situation, all with a meaning centered on him.
At the same time he finds himself in a passive role, he is like in a dream, overcome by events and cannot act on them actively.
This is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled, manipulated.
In general they do not have the possibility to adjust reality, illusions are a cruel reality, waking up is excluded.
Experience once in your life a hallucination.
In contrast to dreaming, according to Fuchs, “the sensory and spatial structure of reality that is perceived during psychosis is fundamentally conserved.”
Delusional thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of experience takes place in a real setting.
Why our brains do these kinds of stunts is still an enigma to researchers.
Exceptional situations can cause everyone to momentarily lose the perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people will develop psychosis.
There appears to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factors.
The researchers assume that the people involved have very small brain damage.
It is assumed that the neuronal maturation of the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development by, for example, a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But what still remains unexplained is the way in which the neuronal system anomaly occurs and the fact that it does not manifest itself for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role – stress or a traumatic experience can be a trigger for psychosis, if there is any predisposition.
Hallucinogenic drugs can also trigger psychoses because they act on neurotransmitters.
When our brain heats up.
What is crazy, says psychology professor Erich Kasten of L<0xC3><0xBC>beck, is that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive drugs to get rid of them while others buy very expensive drugs to get them.
The pleasant or unpleasant perception of illusions is often just a matter of point of view.
Kasten has been compiling reports on hallucinations and the phenomena of illusory images for the past ten years: last year he published his results in a book entitled "The Unreal World in Our Head".
Hallucinations are part of the concomitant phenomena typical of psychoses but also of an impressive number of other pathologies.
These include psychological disorders such as borderline or depression but also migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease or head trauma.
It is surprising to find that in certain conditions even the brains of healthy people are prone to hallucinations.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of fragments of memories that are normally inhibited.
They take shape when the areas of the brain that process sensory perceptions, are overactive or not sufficiently restrained; when our brain heats up but also when there is a lack of stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this state just like a brain injury or psychosis.
But also the lack of stimuli, stress, love griefs or other exceptional mental states.
In recent studies, a third of participants admit to having experienced a hallucination at least once in their lives.
In summer 2005 Sarah K. is 16 years old, she lives in a small town in former Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and she goes to high school.
A girl doing everything normal, really.
If there were no images and voices.
During recess, it happens that a young boy, thin, with long brown hair, speaks to him.
When she answers, her classmates look at her in amazement – no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think this shy girl is a whimsical dreamer but Sarah K does not dream, she is certain of it.
She is awake, hears and sees this boy just as she sees and hears the girl sitting next to her on the bench.
It can even perceive its presence momentarily.
It's a nice feeling, she finds this young man friendly.
Am I crazy? she asks herself sometimes.
But she knows well that this young man and the other visions are not real and that they will disappear again.
At night the apparitions are generally frightening.
Often the visions are heavy.
When she is in class, she may not be able to take the class because the teacher is just presenting a new student in her eyes and ears while he is invisible to others and the teacher is visibly explaining equations on the board.
At night the apparitions are generally frightening.
When, in the darkness of her room, she waits for the sleep that comes too rarely and far too late, she can often not make the distinction whether she is awake or already dreaming, whether the images she sees, the grimacing faces or the girl with bloody nicks on her arms and legs are before her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, she cries out to these creatures.
She doesn't talk about it to her parents or her friends, they'd think she's crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She got her bachelor's degree last year and she lives with her friend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since she came into contact with the psychologist Kasten on the Internet, she knows very well that she is not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or does not have enough stimulation, the likelihood is high that they will hallucinate after a while.
I guess the brain's not busy enough, so there's animation.
Sarah K., an only child, was afraid of other children when she was little and often played by herself.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at age 13 that the man she called dad, since she was of age to think, was not her real father.
These are the same brain areas that are active for visual and acoustic hallucinations, and for real impressions and noises, so it is very difficult for people like Sarah K to tell the difference between illusion and reality. "Every experience," according to Kasten "takes place in the brain, reality is formed from there.
Hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, which is why they seem so real.”
For Kasten, night dreams are also a form of hallucination.
Hallucinations of healthy people do not differ fundamentally from those in acute psychoses.
Unlike schizophrenics, the mentally healthy person is able to recognize that fantasies are not real images.
This is why Kasten advises his patients to treasure hallucinations as a special talent.
There is only one step between the dream and the hallucination.
In our overly consciousness-centered world, we unfortunately quickly tend to take imaginary experiences for pathologies, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and chief physician of the psychiatry and psychotherapy clinic at Florence Nightingale Hospital in D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful disease that also contains something positive, creative - madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the so-called oniroid form of experience, a particular form of the dream-awakened modification of consciousness.
The oniroid experiences are very complex semi-dreams that are perceived as real by the person who lives them and that he can not differentiate from the dream even when he is in a state of awakening.
The state of oniroid consciousness manifests itself during trauma or in situations of extreme pathologies such as for patients with polyradiculopathy who are fully conscious, experience motor paralysis.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of self and of the world, due to a total and lasting inability to move, he replaces this real situation that undermines his life, by his own imaginary world that is dissociated from reality.
It is a state of mental boundary between dream and hallucination.
As it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change of world takes place but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
It is, in fact, an intense form of means and interpretation, in a situation in itself intolerable, an organizational capacity that is given to us men, not to sink into the nothingness of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real even later in the memories.
The Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Classen also describes his dreamlike experiences in his book "Change of Heart" as a saving action of the soul.
He is 49 years old, when his conscious goes on a journey of several days after the operation of a heart valve followed by a transplant; during this time, his body is condemned to remain immobile in resuscitation.
Claussen dives into a world he created from scratch, visiting foreign places, time travel. He sees himself as an old man in bed in a railway sanatorium, a robot at his bedside watching over his health.
He lived in the Middle Ages among nobles who manufactured blood-based narcotics.
He is kidnapped by a Greek motorcycle who takes him to his country, he surfs with his hospital bed in the snow of the Alps and meets a Korean mobster.
He absorbs himself completely in this imaginary world, everything is real even later in his memories.
According to Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
The dream is a completely different state, he writes describing what he experienced.
Unlike dreams, memories from mental journeys are extremely clear and very detailed even years later.
We can even say that they are much more distinct and more intensive than the actual experience.
The intensity of this experience bursts the horizon of our other daily experiences, according to the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
In short, oniroid delusions, psychoses, hallucinations and psychedelic experiences show us how fragile our inner representations of external reality are even in a waking state.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarizes the psychologist Kasten "can cause a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be very rewarding.
The first snow may fall
Burda
At the age of 27, the children will take over the publishing house.
Kallen’s appointment as CEO of Burda Publishing is an intermediate solution: in the longer term, Hubert Burda wants his two children to take over the press group, he told the newspaper Spiegel.
The holding company must remain 100% a family business.
Hamburg - In the long term, the publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children
The two children will inherit at age 27 and are firmly committed to joining the company, Hubert Burda, 69, told Spiegel.
All details have been settled in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will arise later.
We will also have to see if they are able to do so.
You can’t tax your children on 7,500 employees without knowing if they have the capacity to take care of them.
It would destroy the children as well as the company.
Burda had announced last Thursday that he was retiring from the position of President-Director-General in January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52, has been a member of the Board of Directors since 1999.
He was primarily responsible for the technology sector.
Subsequently, he was responsible for the treasury sector, i.e. he was responsible for the capital of the company and after the departure of J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Todenh<0xC3><0xB6>fer he also took the lead in marketing, the foreign sector, printing and finance.
Thus for the first time it is not a member of the family who is at the head of the Burda editions.
The children of Burda are respectively 19 and 17, his son Felix who would have today 42 years, died a few years ago.
The appointment of Kallen also serves as a link for the next 10 or 15 years.
Burda specifies that the holding company must remain 100% in the hands of the family.
Ruins have always taken place in families who have let themselves be carried away by a bulimia of capital, who have made enormous unfortunate speculations thinking that they could climb higher and higher.
That was never my strategy.
I never had a dream of universal power, Burda said.
I do not see myself in the role of preceptor of the country as Springer could be and I do not intend to be part of these international leagues like Time, these companies have taken on far too much importance.
Integral Beauty
Everything you could want, in terms of beauty and well-being, at your fingertips.
This is the objective of El Corte Inglés, which has just inaugurated in the Callao shopping centre (Madrid), a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2, dedicated to the care and attention of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, houses prestigious brands such as Hedonai, a specialist in laser hair removal, Spaxion, with its relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments, Luis & Tachi, hairdressers, Marina d'Or, which has a gym, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a food department, with in particular a tea room, which offers more than 130 different kinds.
Spaxion offers, among other things, to enjoy a relaxing massage with your companion, while contemplating the exceptional views of the capital, or to rent for two hours the relaxation area to organize your own "Beauty Party" with eight of your friends and to relax with a session of jacuzzi, massages while drinking a glass of champagne.
In total, 250 m2 are distributed in 12 rooms, where you can benefit from the most innovative face, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
Like, for example, cavitation to fight against cellulite or vibrating platforms.
The gym also has these devices, as well as virtual "coaches" that guide the steps of customers, offering them a fully personalized treatment.
It all starts with entering your personal code on a touchscreen, located in front of the device.
Several videos then show us how to properly perform our exercise program.
Its director ensures that 15 minutes (heating and stretching included), are enough to make all the muscles of the body work.
And, if after working our body, we want to go through the hair salon, Luis & Tachi has a room where we offer rituals of hair repair, brightness or nutrition, all personalized.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the watchwords of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year from 10am to 10pm.
Varied décolleté
Christmas is coming and it is never superfluous to study the look of the stars to adapt it to our festive wardrobe.
The shape of the neckline, very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the variables that we must take into account.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie has chosen an exaggerated and very complicated neckline. This is not very advisable.
Endesa and Barcelona, equip themselves with the electric car
The electricity company Endesa, in collaboration with the City Council of Barcelona, has created the "Oficina LIVE".
This is a project aimed at developing and promoting the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The "Oficina LIVE" (Logistics for the Implementation of the Electric Vehicle) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the implantation of the electric car in the city and will set up agreements regarding mobility, carrying out procedures, coordinating, presenting subsidies, etc.
In addition, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, gather the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
Ultimately, the idea is to launch what will become the transport of the future.
3 "Electric Cities"
But Barcelona is not the only city that will get involved in the implantation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville are joining the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government, as part of the MOVELE Plan, to launch the implementation of the electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat of Catalonia.
Its objective is to promote the activities of Research and Technological Development in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These include energy-related activities, in particular energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative in which Endesa is involved in the promotion of the electric car.
The company takes part in standardization groups at European level and has a set of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees “a future of tranquility” for the motor sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero, sees "a future of tranquility" for the Spanish automotive industry, which, he recalled, is the main export sector of the country.
During the presentation of the Economic Report of the President of the Government for 2009, Zapatero recalled the measures launched by the executive during the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without a Competitiveness Plan for the automotive sector, we would now have a landscape of abandonment, of closure of some of our main production sites," said the President of the Government.
“Thanks to this plan and the decision of the brands to remain in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can envisage a future of tranquility for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector,” he added.
In this sense, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Integral Plan for the Automotive Sector (PIA), has devoted 800 million euros to the projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which have mobilized an investment of more than 3 000 million euros.
The chief executive explained that this investment was intended both for the development of new models and for the modernization of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also highlighted government demand support measures, alluding to Plan 2000E, put in place in collaboration with the autonomous communities and automotive companies.
According to the President, this plan has reduced the average emissions of new vehicles marketed in the Spanish market by 6% and has contributed to a “strong increase” in registrations, which increased by “40%” in November.
20,000 m2 of collectible cars
Madrid hosts the first edition of the International Exhibition of Collectible Cars, a meeting place for professionals and enthusiasts of the motor world.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 at the Pabell<0xC3><0xB3>n de Cristal of the Casa de Campo de Madrid.
They have an exhibition area of 20,000 m2, where more than 200 national and international exhibitors will be present.
Not only can you find motorcycles and vintage cars, but you will also find at ClassicAuto Madrid items of all kinds related to the world of motoring.
Thus, in the exhibitors of the pavilion, we can find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, complements, magazines, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of items related to the world of the collector's engine that will delight collectors and the curious.
Among the participating companies, we will find, among others, Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, specialists in automobile sales, Juan Lumbreras, restoration, Coupe-Francisco Pueche, sales and restoration of automobiles, or Cochera Clásicos, specialist of Mercedes Benz.
Aptitude test outdoors
But the commercial activity of this fair will also include parallel activities: gatherings, sports exhibitions, aptitude tests, presentations and competitions.
Aptitude tests with vintage automobiles and motorcycles will also take place on a circuit set up outside the fairgrounds.
Mazda3 i-Stop: A sustainable sports spirit
Mazda intends to prove that sportsmanship is not angry with respect for the environment.
For this purpose, it has just integrated on the Mazda3 the engine stop and start system, called i-Stop, a device that, at least for now, is only available on the 150-horsepower gasoline 2.0 engine.
This second generation of Mazda3 is illustrated by the good rating that it has obtained as a whole.
The details, the finish of the vehicle, the habitability, the behavior, the mechanics, the i-Stop system...
All of these aspects are remarkable on the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driver's seat, it turns out that the front seats have excellent ergonomics and fixing.
The touch of the steering wheel is also particularly pleasant.
Continuing with the set formed by the dashboard and console, we see how Mazda has continued in the Japanese trend of creating a futuristic interior design, with many buttons and controls, as well as bright colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of the Honda Civic.
That is why we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and more particularly with the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to surpass.
Continuing with the cabin, this compact Japanese car has more than enough room to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
Added to all this is a large chest with regular shapes.
The automatic engine stop and start system, at least for now, is only available on the two-liter, 150-horsepower gasoline engine and with manual six-speed shifting.
This engine is a real delight. It is illustrated by its finesse, its low noise, its performance and the control of its consumption.
Indeed, although the most demanded Mazda3 are diesel models, those that do not perform a large number of kilometers per year should not exclude this i-Stop with gasoline engine, both for its great comfort of speed and for its controlled consumption.
Regarding the level of equipment, the model chosen for the test is the Sportive, in other words the one with the largest number of series elements.
Among the standard equipment, the lane change assistant (RVM) that removes blind spot, traction and stability controls, cruise control, photosensitive interior mirror, on-board computer on a large screen, parking sensors, independent air conditioning, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and bluetooth audio, as well as 17-wheel steering wheel.
In addition, as if this equipment were not enough, this version had the Premium Pack which, for an additional 1,500 euros, includes among other elements bi-xenon adaptable headlights and a BOSE audio system with disc loader.
Conclusion:
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is particularly distinguished by the quality of the materials used, by its behaviour and by its high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not drive many kilometres a year will be able to opt for the i-Stop version associated only with the 150-horsepower 2.0-litre petrol engine.
The only drawback of this model is its high price, which is between 21 770 euros for the Luxury finish and 23 270 euros for the tested model, the Sportive.
In return for this large sum, the Mazda3 will offer us a great deal of satisfaction every day.
“First” of luxury
L.A. covers the red carpet of sensuality embodied by Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars have dazzled us more than ever, dressed in models as elegant as sexy for the release of Nine. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our “Pe”, as sophisticated as she was used to, had opted for a dark “lady”.
The promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that only allows you to look at your email, without offering the possibility of even seeing certain types of attachments or browsing the Internet.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the United States, when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
In truth, it is more difficult to see it on the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek offers a very low price and a monthly subscription, which is less than half of what it costs, for example, the data subscription of the iPhone.
Given its success, the company has launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free lifetime data service, for six times more expensive than the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the event The Web, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
He is just as limited as his American big brother, but comes with a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscription, around 12 euros, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a Smartphone already know what it means to give up data when crossing a border or desperately looking for a cafeteria on the Wifi (or a Fon connection) to be able to consult his mail.
The idea of roaming at a fixed price is incredibly appealing and has long been expected to work.
Indeed, some operators have special agreements and travel options, but as far as I am concerned, I would need to have done a thesis in physics to understand them and good glasses to read small print.
The European Commission's repeated calls for affordable roaming rates across Europe have had a barely noticeable effect.
Outside of your home country, you're hesitant to use the data, and you're not wrong.
That a small device like the FonPeek (it is always curious that it is called Fon when it does not have Wifi) offers this type of rates, means that operators begin to think differently and study different proposals allowing them to make their data network profitable.
Kindle is another good example, it includes downloading books and other research on the Internet.
No subscription and no hassle.
It is a connected device and you pay when you buy it and not every month.
And this is what I hope to see one day for the FonPeek: a purchase option with lifetime access as Peek already offers in the United States.
Not that I want to buy it.
I'm looking at my mail on my phone, thank you.
I just want it because I believe it is a fairer formula for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
Michelle's favorite color
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the first lady of the United States.
If she went to the inauguration of Barack Obama as President of the United States with a dress and a coat of this color, she chose, in fact, the same to accompany her in the second moment, undoubtedly, the most important of her life: the presentation in Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama wore a very similar model on these two occasions: in addition to their similar color, a yellow pulling towards the green with bright reflections, both times, the outfit consisted of three pieces: the dress, the jacket and the coat, in the same fabric, and was decorated with a large embroidery or a necklace.
So much so that at first glance, it seems that the first lady of the United States follows in the footsteps of the Princess of Asturias and has chosen to put on the same outfits.
But the fabric in which the two sets are cut makes them very different.
If for the taking of office it was a thick lace, on the other hand, she wore a printed velvet in Oslo.
The accessories are also different: green shoes with medium heels for the first time, and a similar model, but golden, this time.
The hairstyle has also changed: the hair is now raised while she was wearing it released the previous time.
75% of working mothers have had work-related problems because of their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of younger generations who want to be mothers.
This is revealed by the study "Fecundity and professional career of women in Spain", carried out by the CSIC in collaboration with the Instituto de la Mujer.
The survey, carried out on 9,737 women aged 15 to 75, leaves no room for doubt: 75% of working mothers have had their professional career limited because of motherhood.
The study indicates that there are many differences regarding the beginning of life as a couple and the number of children, whether the woman works or not and the type of job occupied.
Those who do not work outside the home, work part-time or have an unstable job, get married earlier, have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children.
In contrast, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, postpone entry into couple life and first pregnancy, and have fewer children.
Women between 35 and 49 years of age with a fixed job have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after moving in as a couple. This figure rises to 4.1 among those working in the public sector. "These data show that women with stable employment have needed more time in their lives to get it, which has led them to push back the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of employment exercised largely influences maternity, but less the date of beginning of common life, "explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that widens the gap between the age of marriage of women and their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of training, the more they get married and have their first child late.
The difference is also maintained among women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49 age group, those with elementary and higher education were mothers for the first time at an average of 25.1 and 32.1 years, respectively.
"Another distinction also appears between women, depending on their level of education.
While those who have completed basic education marry and have their first child before finding a stable job, those who have completed middle or higher education reverse this program and give priority to obtaining a stable job as a prerequisite for marriage and the arrival of a child, "says Ms. Delgado.
Diane Kruger is well worth it.
L’Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its jealous list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
Starting next year, the German actress will embody the image of several products of the brand, intoning the universal motto "Because I'm worth it well".
The protagonist of Merry Christmas, one of the most elegant actresses on the international scene, joins other celebrities registered with L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penelope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter this club so select were the actresses Evangeline Lilly (Lost) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millionaire).
For men, the cosmetics brand also has luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (Dre Grey, anatomy lessons) and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's companion in Lost).
The prices of British fashion
The British have a lot to say in the world of fashion.
Its greatest representatives, designers and models, past and present, gathered for the annual award ceremony, which took place in London, at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one missed the appointment.
Former model Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, voted Best Model of the Year.
The Poker of Aces by Manuel Vincent
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poquer de ases (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) about thirty "radiographies" of writers who have lived through his literary life (and sometimes, his other life).
He does not do it according to the predictable and apprehended genres (biographical summary, life and work), but by looking for something similar to the ignition core of the created character.
The journey is exciting and Vincent spares neither fears nor illuminations.
Delicious pleasure, this book is also a moving invitation to readings and re-readings.
I’ll leave you with a few snapshots here.
On Albert Camus: “In its pages, I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical impulse, the same one that I felt without naming it: pleasure against fate, morality without guilt and innocence without any god.”
On Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote what was in his blood, not in his head, between impotence and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic humour, devoid of meaning, like the blade of the knife that almost killed him."
On Graham Greene: “Our man was inspired by this woman of a passion which lasted thirteen years, in whose flesh he combined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege which consisted in reaching heaven by the way of perdition.”
On James Joyce: "The Ulysses was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the peaks of eight thousand meters of universal literature, which must be climbed by the north face, on which the best mountaineers still let go and always taken."
William Faulkner: “He was a strange guy.
Of himself, he sometimes said that he was the heir of a county landowner and other times that he was the son of a black woman and a crocodile.
These two dreams were grand.”
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer collected the demented cry uttered from a bridge by this character of Munch to carry his echo to the depths of the night of the twentieth century, in his literary form, and he did so in the flight of himself and invoking posterity with a violent speech to the maggots."
On Dorothy Parker: "One day she got down on her knees and prayed, 'Dear God, I beg you to make me stop writing like a woman.'
On Joseph Conrad: "On his grave were engraved the verses of Spenser: "Sleep after effort, / after storm the harbor, / rest after war, / after life, weary death delights."
On Virginia Wolf: “In her luggage she also carried her depressions.
Her husband very normally accepted that she should tell him that Edward VII was spying on her among the azaleas or that the birds were singing in Greek.
We have never seen a man so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent exceeded madness.
On P<0xC3><0xAD>o Baroja: "What did Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n-Santos do but try to hide Joyce from Baroja?
What was Benet trying to do but to have Faulkner shoot Baroja?
What did it do but to aspire to the glory of this man to be his pedestal?”
A cowardly aggression
Last week, my mother, who is about 70 years old, was walking in our neighborhood of the city of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years old passed by her and our dog, a half-blood, saved from the SPA and weighing no more than six kilos, and without saying a word, they gave her two kicks that left the dog grizzly.
Our indignation is immense because we do not see what is amusing about gratuitously attacking a small helpless animal which, moreover, was on a leash.
To this must be added the indignation of a lady who walked quietly and who, when she insulted these individuals, came to fear for her physical integrity, since an energetic who attacks an animal is able to do the same to a woman, a child, an old man or, ultimately, any person weaker than him.
The episode took place around 5 p.m., on a Tuesday like any other, in a usually quiet neighborhood.
The dog moaned all day.
We have of course filed a complaint with the police station of the neighborhood even if we doubt that it serves much and in order not to touch the sensibilities, we just want to specify that the coward killers were Spanish.
Outrage has led us to denounce this fact.
We don’t understand what’s going on in young people so that they find it fun to mistreat a helpless animal for free that gives us affection, friendship and keeps us company.
We do not know where the right education and respect for animals and people has gone.
Michelin and Fesvial, sets for helmet wear
The tire manufacturer Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the wearing of helmets, mainly among younger motorcyclists, as indicated today by the two structures.
The objective of this initiative is to raise awareness of the importance of wearing a helmet, since it is the only element of protection to avoid head injuries, or even death, in the event of a two-wheeled accident.
Michelin said the campaign was in line with its commitment to road safety, which “goes beyond the design and manufacture of ever safer products” and said it was contributing to this goal through other educational and informative actions.
This new campaign to encourage the wearing of helmets on two wheels, under the motto "To be or not to be", will include a first phase during which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle garages, to ensure the widest dissemination.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety “is a constant concern” for the company, because as a manufacturer of tires for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main objectives is to develop ever safer products.
The sale of light commercial vehicles is growing
After almost two years, the light commercial vehicle market is starting to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decrease, according to the figures of the employers' union of manufacturers Anfac and Ganvam, that of dealers.
However, the good news needs to be nuanced, since the reference for comparison, November 2008, was particularly bad, with a 60% decrease compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the rebound of last month, the registrations accumulated in these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, if we add up all the vehicles that fall into the category of light commercial vehicles (derived from passenger cars, pick-ups, vans, light vans and light chassis trucks) 95 853 have been sold.
The big clouds that affect their demand the most have not dissipated, because although they are also purchased by individuals, most purchases are made by small or medium-sized companies, which pay in almost 100% of cases through external financing.
Thus, in addition to the restrictions implied by the limitation of bank credits, other factors must be added, such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the bad economic situation.
In the face of this situation and unlike the passenger vehicles, the 2000E purchase aid was of little use.
In addition to individuals, the self-employed and SMEs who wish to acquire a light commercial vehicle of less than 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions that does not exceed 160 grams per kilometre, can also benefit, but the number of operations speaks for itself.
Yesterday, at Ganvam, it was recalled the need for the administration to pay special attention to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The dealers' association predicts a 2010 similar to the one that ends, for which it calculates a drop in sales (of passenger vehicles and 4x4) of 19%.
Emergency braking assistance is now mandatory
As was the case with the ABS anti-lock braking system and as will be the case with the ESP stability control, emergency braking assistance systems will be a mandatory feature on European cars.
They are already mandatory on passenger cars and light commercial vehicles newly registered, while for the rest of the vehicles a grace period has been set until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to strengthen the protection of pedestrians, although, by its mode of action, it can also help to avoid many rear shocks.
The Emergency Brake Assist works by increasing the pressure on the brakes in the event of an emergency detected by the system thanks to the driver’s kick.
But the latter does not always maintain the pressure until the end.
According to a study conducted by the car parts manufacturer Bosch, a third of the drivers involved in an accident had not been able to press the brake before the collision, and half of them had not taken advantage of its full force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, in revenge, requires the maximum of the brake system, reducing the distance that the car needs to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with these elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be prevented each year.
This reduction would be even greater with the popularization of the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems: it is calculated that one in four accidents with injuries would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that, thanks to a radar or a camera, detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to slightly acting on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, he helps by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and although the collision is inevitable, the device exerts maximum force on the brakes to minimize damage.
General Motors postpones Opel plan until January
While workers at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) were warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that production of the new Meriva would be launched in the first week of April – probably on the 8th –, according to Javier Ortega, the North American manufacturer warned that it will need more time to conclude the rescue plan.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, said that every point in the plan has been approved by the party concerned.
And this may mean that the final document, which will be submitted first to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where the factories are located, is postponed until early 2010.
At GM, a decision on the sale of Saab is expected in the coming days.
It is therefore not surprising that the Swedish government has tightened the pressure on the American manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in contact with potential new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, which also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the candidacy of the Dutch manufacturer of sports cars Skyper, supported by the Russian group Converg, takes importance.
In the event that there is no agreement with any of them, GM could sell a part of Saab to the Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
Driving the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To design their latest and most precious jewel, Porsche’s engineers took the Boxster S and managed to slim it down to just under 80 kilos, leaving the scale at just 1,275 kilos.
This led them to do without, in the first place, the automatic roof which was replaced by a manual tarpaulin roof, making it possible to reduce by 21 kilos, to use aluminum doors like those of the GT3, 15 kilos less, to remove the air conditioner, 13 kilos, to reduce the fuel tank from 64 to 54 liters, 7 kilos gained, to mount sport baskets, 19 kilos less.
Finally, they gave up the CDR-30 audio system, gaining another six kilograms and replaced the door handles with fabric handles, saving the remaining kilo.
Although the model also exists with the dual-clutch PDK, the test was performed on a six-speed manual gearbox model, mainly on roads on the California secondary network, in the mountains, with particularly tortuous turns.
His behavior can only be described as irreproachable.
The decrease in weight does not prevent the car from rolling on the ground with aplomb.
On the contrary: it’s been a long time since we’ve tested such a small and lightweight model that, at the same time, guarantees so much safety when cornering, even at high speed.
He is a little athlete, able to warm up his muscles at low speed for the necessary time, until we asked him to sprint, brake, recover and push his engine again...
Thanks to its direction, as communicative as it is precise, the car will do what our hands will indicate on the steering wheel.
And it will do so with surgical precision.
Engine sound at will
The sound of its V6 boxer, with 320 horsepower (10 more than the Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be enhanced with the "sport" option or thanks to a system that modifies the roar of the engine, already used on the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, whether at standstill or during recoveries.
The suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The road surface we covered with the Boyxster Spyder was quite damaged, but the car managed the potholes well.
The electronic assistants barely made an appearance all the way, while on some turns we found ice in the early morning and gravel, later in the morning.
In short, an ultralight car, the most entertaining to drive and which is much more than a simple modification of the Boxster S.
The car will go on sale in February 2010, at a price of 70,831 euros.
" Bag Girl "
Close friend of Karl Lagerfeld, icon of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional starlet of the house shows, the singer displays her bad girl face with as much capacity as her Chanel bags.
More than a “Bad Girl” or an “It Girl”, she is a “Bag Girl”.
Baskonia offers itself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral achieved a resounding triumph at 91-82 during its visit to the Maccabi Electra's difficult terrain, despite the many absences suffered by Dusko Ivanovic's team. She is thus at the top of her group, after the great show of Mirza Teletovic who, with eight baskets with three points was the best of his team (29 evaluation).
The Vitoria team was able to fill the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a great deal of commitment and collective work, even if it had to wait until the end to win the race.
In addition, the great skill from the perimeter, with 16 baskets with three points scored, largely determined the final victory.
The match started quickly for the blues and reds, who took the lead from the start.
The fact that the first four baskets of the Vitoria team were marked from the perimeter, suggested that they had jumped on the Israeli ground with warm wrists.
English and Teletovic were the main architects of the 18-20 final of the first quarter.
The second quarter was on the same tone, but <0xC3><0x81>lava's team chose Barac's inside play and Eliyahu's work, which was received with cheers and applause back to his old home, to increase their advantage at the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to be noticed as the best player of his team, with 13 points scored, although the "minus six" of Splitter's evaluation already hinted that this night was not going to be the best of the Brazilian.
But in this match, despite the fact that they were on the right track at the break, nothing was played, far from it, and Avala's team wanted to remind Vitoria's that we do not win so easily on their field, and thanks to "Elias' hand", they managed to enter the match.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the yellows taking the lead over the bright (50-49).
Other difficulties
Ivanovic's players, wounded but far from being dead, needed to chain some skilful actions to take the air, and it was at this moment that Mirza Teletovic's submachine gun appeared, which, with three baskets with three consecutive points and the help of English and Ribas, put the counter to a reassuring score (54-67).
Avala's team went out to play all-out in the final period and English and San Emeterio (60-75) advised that they would not let anyone take what they had earned during the first thirty minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign and tried to support it from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for fouls, Ivanovic's players did not rush, defended well, and although the Israelis got closer at the last minute (80-85), the game was already played and the victory escaped to Tel Aviv for the first time of the season.
Injuries prevent Unicaja from fighting
Unicaja lost loudly in Greece to Olympiacos and handed it the lead of Euroleague Group B, in a match marked by the absences of Unicaja players, especially in the home game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team was not frightened by the atmosphere of the Peace and Friendship Pavilion or by the size of the rival, probably one of the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The game of the first quarter made the Andalusians dream, an aggressive defense and three baskets with three consecutive points, two of the leader Omar Cook and one of Guillem Rubio who dazzled the local team 12-18, in the ninth minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of Unicaja, although the home team's arsenal with the home game of Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, allowed to overturn the score 22-20, in the thirteenth minute, at which point an action, a beginning of fight, between the North American leaders the Beverley and Williams
The Greek team began to function showing its superiority in both sides, while the injury exit of the English center Joel Freeland and the three personal faults of Carlos Jiménez weighed on the Unicaja.
The infielders and Lithuanian winger Linas Kleizas, with their three-pointers, dug the lead 44-32, in the nineteenth minute.
An impossible comeback
The third period was particularly offensive for Olympiacos who, despite the 19 losses, proved superior and even managed to equal the difference of the game played in Malaga 66-48, in the twenty-seventh minute, causing the head of the group to falter.
Unicaja was trying to overcome the absences and the last outing of Scottish center Robert Archibald, who was injured during the match.
Despite all these problems, Unicaja, thanks to its organization, Cook's three-pointers, and Lewis' support, left some hope with 66-57, in the thirty-first minute.
But victory was virtually impossible as Olympiacos proved implacable when the players put pressure and showed their superiority in centimeters in the area.
The Croatian center Nikola Vujcic, managed to recover the score to 81-62, in the thirty-seventh minute, and Unicaja submitted, accepting the victory of Olympiacos.
How much should you be paid based on your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they would deserve based on their profile, thanks to a new application from Trovit, the search engine with the highest number of real estate, employment and vehicle classifieds in Spain.
The “How much should you be paid?” tool calculates users’ salaries from more than 140,000 job offers available to Trovit in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where you must register your profession, years of experience, age and the city where you want to work.
For a week since the app was launched, the search engine has detected that, as a rule, the Spanish worker “feels underpaid,” Trovit product manager Albert Ribera said in a statement.
According to the data available to Trovit<0xC3><0xA0> from its search engines in the United Kingdom and France, Spaniards are the lowest paid.
A British computer programmer receives 45,226 euros gross per year and a French, 31,059, while a Spanish receives 24,000 euros.
In the same way, a driver receives 34,247 euros gross per year in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the lowest paid work in Spain is that of a waiter, with 11,592 euros net per year, followed by that of a seller, with 14,725 euros, and that of a worker, with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the Internet over the past three months have been drivers, part-time jobs and social workers.
Brazil sets date for Zelaya's departure
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya to stay at its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The ousted president will have to abandon the diplomatic legation no later than January 27, 2010, the date of the official end of his mandate.
Francisco Catunda, chargé d'affaires of the Brazilian Embassy in the capital of Honduras, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he must leave the embassy, where he has been a refugee since September 21, before that date.
“He is aware that he must leave on January 27, at the end of his mandate, he must look for another destination.”
The channel also quoted the former president, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the end of the established deadline: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by telephone.
After the November 29 elections (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, the same week, he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation ultimately failed, as Zelaya refused the condition of political exile that the de facto government presided over by Roberto Micheletti intended to impose on him.
Thank you very much
After rosy days since last spring, during which asset inflation has been the dominant note in the markets, uncertainty is emerging again, which is not surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment where agents make decisions about a future that is inherently uncertain.
The remedy employed by central banks to stabilize markets has been to monetize debt through the direct purchase of assets and indirectly by giving abundant liquidity at near-zero rates, so that financial institutions buy assets to be mobilized.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases have been virtually finalized and, without questioning their non-conformist liquidity policy, are starting to put some sand in the wheels, as the ECB has done, with their auction one year from next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the global economy to sustain an economic recovery without heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reversal of the reduction in risk premiums.
Stock market volatility and corporate bond spreads are rising again, although they remain far from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States have been forced to socialize private risk and public debt is again affected.
There is again a flight to quality and the United States, Japan and Germany have been the refuges chosen by investors, causing an increase in the differences between the countries of the euro zone and Germany.
Spain was barely affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor's threatened a further downward revision of the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a bit of uncertainty is not bad for silencing moral hazard advocates, who were once again trying to provoke a case of conscience among those in charge of world economic policy who had curbed the destructive effects derived from the limitation of credit on the destruction of employment, when what should be done is to decree a new day of Thanksgiving.
However, the situation in Dubai resembles a tribal struggle between the emirs to restore their place in power in the emirates and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that hides a public deficit, elections, and a new government that discovers the pot of roses.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Dur<0xC3><0xA3>o Barroso.
It would be completely irrational for Ecofin to save Hungary from non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and to allow a euro area country to fail to meet its commitments.
What is logical, however, is that Ecofin has encouraged the Greek government to be transparent and makes its citizens co-responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we find ourselves facing an episode of normalisation of transitional risk premiums, after a few excesses in high positions, this would be predictable.
In the case of Spain, as long as our public debt spreads are commensurate with European corporate bonds, we need not worry.
If the European gaps narrowed and ours continued to grow, then it would be an idiosyncratic Spanish risk.
The Standard & Poor's affair is an anecdote. When our forecast indicators force most of the study services to anticipate their recovery models and to revise upwards their forecasts for 2011, with the OECD and the European Commission, which come back to the charge with a Japanese model for the Spanish economy, it does not augur much hope for their warning.
Again, this looks like a great opportunity to buy Spanish assets, even if for now "caution is mother of safety".
Connected Sectors
The president of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to speak yesterday, before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies, where the energy strategy of Spain for the next two decades is being discussed these days.
After his speech, which was followed by that of the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr. Galán sketched for the press what he had mentioned in front of the subcommittee, eight-clos.
For the president of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50 000 million euros until 2020 and 60 000 million more between that date and 2030, in case the nuclear power plants currently in operation remain open.
If this is not the case, the necessary investments would not amount to 60 000 million but to 95 000.
On the other hand, Iberdola believes that for the next decade, investments should not be devoted to increasing production capacity, but to distribution networks and international interconnections.
From 2020, the issue is changing, and power will have to be increased.
His bet focuses on both gas and coal-fired power plants, with carbon dioxide recovery mechanisms and, above all, on renewable energies.
In this area, it considers that 18,000 MW more are needed, along with other "supporting energies".
Galán, who believes that the draft Sustainable Economy Law that the government has just approved is in line with what his company is demanding, did not want to attack the royal decree to encourage the consumption of national coal, which contradicts policies to fight global warming.
According to him, there is "a clear long-term bet" in this sense, despite the "one-off" measures, as the president of Iberdrola described them.
In any case, Galán believes that investment decisions, although they are long-term, must begin to be taken, as they take some time to reach maturity and a stable remuneration framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial wins the Aer Lingus handling market in ten airports
The Swiss company Swissport, a subsidiary of Ferrovial for airport services on land, will play the role of privileged partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus, for freight services, in ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important.
The agreement, whose economic terms have not been revealed, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a collaboration protocol to create the Smart Infrastructure Innovation Center.
The alliance foresees an investment of 20 million until 2012, 50% of which will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the centre will be to carry out research on energy efficiency on motorways and at airports.
Acciona races its first motorway in Australia at Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first concession motorway in Australia, a market on which it is already working as an energy company and water manager.
The construction site at stake is a tunnel estimated at 1,700 million Australian dollars (about 1,047 million euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its rivals.
A 5-kilometre-long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane on the east coast is the option to allow Acciona to establish itself in the country as a public works company and motorway concessionaire.
The City Council wishes to be able to dispose of it by the end of 2014.
After having chosen the public/private collaboration (PPP for its initials in English) to carry out the project, as part of a business plan under the tutelage of Ernst & Young, the local administration already has a list of the finalists who will be responsible for the construction and operation of the toll.
Pending the presentation of their offers next May, the planned investment amounts to 1,700 million Australian dollars (about 1,047 million euros) and in the last phase three consortia compete, with a notable presence of European manufacturers.
The Transcity group is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company in the business, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The former is one of Australia’s largest manufacturers, while the latter, based in Italy, is one of Europe’s leading specialists in underground work.
Against the Acciona team is the Northern Direct consortium, with the presence of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and final consortium that has passed the test is LBRJV, whose capital is shared between the Australian Leighton (subsidiary of the German manufacturer Hochtief, which in turn has the participation of ACS), another local company, Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the Welsh company specializing in public works, Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises major projects and privatisations, but entering them is a major challenge, if not through the acquisition of a local construction company.
A strategy followed by the companies Hochtief and Bilfinger, already mentioned, in addition to their Asian references, and which still remains an unvalidated step for the Spanish giants of the sector.
ACS has just gained a foothold in this market through its 30% stake in Hochtief, owner of Leighton.
Assets of millionaires
Acciona relies on a geographical area of the greatest importance for the sector, on which it already has a large presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination sector.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind farm, Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the group of companies responsible for erecting and managing the Adelaide desalination plant, with a budget of 700 million.
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and take advantage of synergies to enter the construction and infrastructure management markets.
The underground toll road, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and the Northern Link, is intended to link the Toowong Western Motorway to the peripheral road at Kelvin Grove (see map), by 4 kilometres of tunnel. This is the largest existing project to reduce traffic congestion in Brisbane.
The schedule set by the administration indicates that the auction will take place during the summer of 2010 and that work will begin in December of next year.
Despite the fact that this toll road will be open to traffic at the end of 2014, it is not expected that the work will be completed before 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include two lanes, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland government will provide A$500 million (€308 million) for its funding.
Brisbane already offers work in Hochtief
Australia continues to see significant growth for Hochtief, who yesterday mentioned a government contract valued at $154 million.
The ACS-owned company will equip the national fibre broadband network infrastructure through its local subsidiary Leighton.
This intervention will provide 400,000 people with fast Internet access and will provide work for the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has given up the project to build the 27-storey King George Tower in the city of Brisbane. Work has not yet begun and Hochtief has concluded the sale for 129 million.
In the United Kingdom, specifically in Manchester, she will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and management of two school groups for 25 years.
The initial investment will be 75 million euros.
FCC is awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million euros
FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, has been awarded €64.5 million for the construction of a 2.1-kilometre-long tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia.
The company was awarded the contract a few days after it was commissioned to expand the Bosruck tunnel (Austria), for a sum of 130 million euros.
Alpine thus consolidates its experience in tunnel construction.
The project is scheduled to start in early 2010 and will take 32 months to complete.
Sra. Rushmore Awarded Renfe Advertising Award
Renfe has entrusted the advertising and marketing services of these next two years to the agency Sra. Rushmore, for a budget of about three million euros per year, said the railway operator.
The contract mentions the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Sra. Rushmore was chosen from 16 agencies that submitted to the tender organized by Renfe, of which four were finalists, including TBWA who was responsible for the creativity over the last three years.
From now on, Ms. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
A fine of 63 million to France Telecom to curb competition
The French competition regulator imposed a fine of 63 million euros on France Telecom for its anti-competitive conduct in the Caribbean region belonging to the country.
According to this institution, the operator has limited competition on fixed and mobile telephony by signing exclusive agreements, by tariffs and by loyalty programs to consumers in the margin of regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company has accumulated more than 450 million euros in fines since 1994, because of the obstacles it places on its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday has also been increased because the competition authority considers that France Telecom has committed similar offences in the past and that it is therefore repeat offender.
An app store
On the other hand, the French company's mobile phone subsidiary has followed in the footsteps of other operators and opened an Internet application store, with the aim of increasing revenues that do not come from voice transmission.
Initially, the Orange app store will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It will be necessary to wait until 2010 for it to arrive in other countries such as Spain.
Their participation in the Champions League has brought in 476.4 million for Real Madrid and Barca since its inception.
The Champions League has become a source of revenue for clubs since its inception in 1992.
Indeed, Real Madrid and FC Barcelona have won 467.4 million, which places them in third and fifth position of the clubs that have pocketed the most money in this competition.
Manchester United is at the top of the list.
Manchester United is at the top of the list.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only brings glory, it is also one of the main sources of income for big clubs.
Indeed, the competition has allocated 5 362.5 million euros to the 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) who have participated in the event since the creation of the tournament, during the 1992-1993 season, according to UEFA information.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona were well-served in this division.
The white club was the third on the continent to receive the most money for its participation, and the only one, with A.C. Milan, to have won the trophy three times.
The Catalan club, current holder of the title and last winner of the former European Cup in 1992, is fifth on the list.
At the top of the list are Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that, in addition, have charged the most money for their participation in the last Champions League.
And that’s even though they lost to Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, in terms of money reported by the Champions League, although it has won more titles than any other (five, while Italy has won four, England three and Germany two).
Distribution (disambiguation)
This apparent paradox can be explained by the complex procedure for the distribution of money applied by UEFA.
For this year, the organization chaired by Michel Platini plans to earn 1,090 million thanks to the Champions League.
Of this sum, UEFA will devote €413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the classification matches (among which Atlético de Madrid) received €2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received 3.8 million just to be there, in addition to 550 00 euros for each game played.
There is also a bonus in case of victory (800,000 euros) and equality (400,000 for each team). Those who arrive in the round of 16 receive three million each, the eight teams who arrive in the quarter-final receive 3.3 million.
The last four teams will each receive $4 million.
And the champion will win 9 million, against the 5.2 received by the other finalist.
Thus, under fixed payments, a club will earn at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
On the other hand, Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a pocketed 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
But in addition, there are variable payments, to which 337.8 million are devoted.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish market is one of the most important, and has four dedicated seats.
The champion of the previous year pocketed 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other part will be paid according to the number of games played during the current year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% of Sos.
The Nueva Rumasa group yesterday listed the details of the share purchase offer by which it intends to acquire a maximum of 25 to 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
A percentage that does not require it to launch a takeover bid (POA) for all the securities.
In concrete terms, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1.5025 per share, which will be disbursed in 10 years and will be paid at a rate of 1% per year for this deferral.
Yesterday, the shares of Sos ended at 1.85 euros; the offer of Nueva Rumasa therefore values the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the actual valuation of Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 advisors.
The Jerez group gives shareholders 15 days to indicate their interest in the sale of the shares.
The CNMV said it had not been informed of the offer, although the Ruiz Mateos company said it had contacted the regulator.
If it took place, the disbursement would amount to 611.7 million, while the capital of Sos is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, Sos continues the restructuring of its management.
In an attempt to stay out of potential takeover bids and the legal back and forth of her former directors, brothers Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s and Jaime Salazar, she announced the election of Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Luis Jordá as internal audit director.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a leadership position in the food business.
This is a newly created position that will report directly to the group chair.
And it is not without controversy, since the company remains submerged in the legal battle for the alleged embezzlement of more than 230 million SOS to companies of Salazar.
Moreover, the possibility that in the coming months SOS will reveal new embezzlements cannot be ruled out.
Regarding the credit to the Salazars, former councillors Ildefonso Ortega and <0xC3><0x81>ngel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) told the National Audience yesterday that they had been informed of the embezzlement of 212 million without knowing the destination.
The CNMV authorizes the OPA of exclusion of Paternina presented by Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) yesterday authorized the exclusion bid submitted by Inversora Mer on Federico Paternina on October 9th.
The watchdog explained that it authorized this operation because it understood that its terms were in accordance with the standards in force and that it considered the content of the explanatory slip submitted "sufficient", following the amendments applied on December 2.
The CNMV has specified that the offer concerns the acquisition of 550 008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, which represents 8.95 % of the share capital, composed of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on the stock exchanges of Madrid and Bilbao.
He also explained that 5,592,778 million shares had been frozen, and that they could not be transferred in any way before the completion of the offer, which he indicated had been fixed by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions of the standards in force.
New tools for car expertise
In these days of bad weather and accidents, car garages are not the only winners.
Every day, thousands of automobiles that have suffered a disaster are brought back to a garage, where an expert must assess the damage suffered and the cost of the repair.
Each claim is different, and calculating the cost of parts and labor time can be a long and complex job.
Calculate by hand the cost of a repair between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including parts and labor can take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the assistance of the latest computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
It is for this reason that almost 100% of experts use this type of systems.
Providers of claims assessment and maintenance services and solutions are dedicated to collecting the information provided by manufacturers, then processing it and offering it to their customers as a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the North American group Solera, is the leading company; 80% of the estimates are made with its products.
Other companies competing in the area of assessment tools and industry information development are GtMotive and Eurotax.
The work with the data provided by the manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, the company in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides them with information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, so that in the last five years, more versions, variants and engines have been launched than in the previous fifteen years.
When a new car comes on the market, these companies get to work.
This is very hard work, because you have to catalog each of the thousand parts of the vehicle and enter its price.
In addition, an "intelligent" graphic image of each model is established on which the different parts of a passenger car can be clicked.
If it is a massively sold model, the work can be ready in a week if the process moves very quickly.
If it is a poorly sold car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of the cars marketed in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models, they have, for example, information on Porsches, but not Ferraris or Lamborghinis.
For vehicles in circulation, the figure exceeds 99%.
To carry out the work of documentation and development of databases, Audatex has eight centers distributed throughout the world (in Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them is specialized in certain brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanical experts) work simultaneously on three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million each year to develop these databases.
Every month, 2.5 million pieces of data are recorded, and customers receive updates every other day.
The development of this huge flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and to offer various products.
The most common application is repair and maintenance, but depending on the country, there are also tools for the management of breakage parts or to calculate the market value or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that provides information on the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer it in our country, but it does in the United States.
Looking at the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support it can provide to professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, the flagship product being AudaPlus, the standard claims assessment solution for experts.
It includes cars, motorcycles, light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of parts, it takes into account the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the paint scales.
This tool is purchased according to its use, for each estimate.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it little, at most ten times a month.
Then, each insurance company, which performs thousands of appraisals, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it has left the assembly line, only thanks to its chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle lenses, and AudaSubastas is a web-based, professional-sector open server for bidding on wrecked vehicles.
Its statistics service is very useful to identify trends, perform geo-demographic analyses or know the common problems by brand or model.
It is possible to study, for example, how many models of a given brand went to the garage for a breakdown or how many suffered serious claims for a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tool.
It markets, among others, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and provides digital images, as well as access to the manufacturer's official parts, prices and times.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, founded in 1971, as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of claims, breakdowns or maintenance.
The WG Evaluation Guide is a historical reference product on the market.
The company works with 24,000 users in garages, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its turnover has grown at a rate of 20% per annum over the last three years, and it generated a turnover of 10.8 million euros in 2008.
At the beginning of last year, it began its internationalization process, with the establishment of an office in Paris.
For its part, Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and established itself in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its turnover is generated in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. It works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 garages, of which 3,000 are in Spain.
Solera Group’s global sales (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will be $557 million, 3.3% higher than in 2008.
In our country, the company will receive 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, the Solera group was listed on the stock exchange $1 billion; today, its shares are valued at a total of $2.4 billion.
Since 2007, it has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is part of the Standard & Poor's benchmark index.
Online auction of damaged cars
Last October, the Solera group bought Autoonline, an Internet platform for the sale of cars, motorcycles and special vehicles affected.
The transaction involved a cost of €59.5 million for 85% of the company’s capital, which could expand next year to the remaining 15%.
The objective of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing a huge international market.
This estimation and sales service is aimed exclusively at professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, garages, cashiers and professional sellers who must be registered before starting to carry out operations.
The platform was established in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, including 500,000 in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
There are currently more than 1500 sellers and 4000 experts registered on the site.
It manages 3,000 ads per day and in the Spanish market, 100 new ads are published every day.
According to Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been removed can no longer circulate, but on the other hand, some parts that are not damaged can be used as spare parts.
Collectible cars can be re-registered, although they have been removed, after complex procedures.
Garage quote in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the Audatex company guarantees that the user obtains a quote in just four steps: identify the vehicle, search for the spare part, create a quote and generate it.
Ease of use is an essential element of these systems, especially to convince older professionals who, to a greater or lesser extent, are reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, including 666 passenger cars, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, to use it, a computer and an Internet connection are necessary.
Once the model to be repaired has been identified thanks to its chassis number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears and the necessary part is selected.
The user can include variables such as the price of labor, mark-ups or discounts, then he can print the quote to give it to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an estimation tool like AudaPlus, but a reference catalog.
The main difference between these two systems is that the garage system does not include estimated labour times.
The cost of using this tool for the garage is 350 euros per year, which can be credited.
Currently, the company Audatex is working to make these images three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics are very keen on, since it will allow, for example, to select a door and rotate it to see the inner face.
