UN chief says there are no military solutions in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia's military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the nearly five-year conflict and more weapons would only exacerbate the violence and suffering of millions.
The UN chief again called on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unify and support negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told a conference on Wednesday that he planned to meet this month with foreign ministers from five countries permanently present in the council - the US, Russia, China, England and France - on the sidelines of the General Assembly's ministerial session to discuss Syria.
Ban expressed regret that the divisions in the council and between the Syrian people and regional powers “have made this situation unsolvable.”
Ban urged the five permanent members to show the solidarity and unity shown when they managed to reach an agreement on Iran's nuclear weapons, thus addressing the crisis in Syria.
8 figures from polls that show Donald Trump has a real chance
Some have tried to label him a “flip-flop” politician.
Others called it a joke.
Others are waiting for the implosion.
But no matter how some Republicans try to topple Donald Trump in the polls, it hasn’t worked (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national polls showed Donald Trump leading with a double-digit percentage and some voices are beginning to seriously question what this means for the real estate mogul’s chances of appointment.
Of course, it's still premature.
None of this says Trump will win the race for the Republican nomination.
Pundits show that, at the same time in 2011, Rick Perry's lead was giving way to Herman Cain in the polls, but neither of them won in any state in the nomination race.
And the reasons why they would fight hard in the general election are numerous.
But outside groups like Jeb Bush’s Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth are admitting Trump’s power and starting to support him with money.
Here are some figures from recent surveys that suggest the real estate mogul isn’t just a passing thing:
The numbers indicating support for Trump have returned to 180 degrees.
Even before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a survey conducted by the University of Monmouth showed that only two out of 10 Republicans had a positive opinion about the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, the figure had risen to 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52%.
Currently, six out of 10 Republicans have a favorable opinion of Donald Trump.
About three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion.
These figures remain.
A Quinnipiac poll in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans in the region have a favorable opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy if Trump won the race for the nomination.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be “enthusiastic” or “happy” if Trump won the race for the nomination.
Only two in 10 say they would be “angry” if Trump won the nomination race.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% say they would be “enthusiastic” versus 40% who say the same about Trump).
The closest in terms of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio, only 21%.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be “disgruntled” or “angry” if front-runner Jeb Bush wins the race for the nomination.
Most Republicans don’t see Trump’s temper as an issue.
Although Donald Trump has been heavily criticized for his insults and bombastic style, 52 percent of Republican voters nationwide believe the real estate mogul has the right temperament to be president, according to a poll conducted Monday by ABC News/Washington Post.
We find the same numbers in Iowa, where 52 percent of Republicans believe Trump has the right personality to lead, according to Quinnipiac’s poll last week.
However, 44 percent say he lacks the personality to act effectively, and nearly six in 10 independents say his temperament has no place in the White House.
Republicans are getting used to the idea.
When they take the intellectual stance, Republican voters consider Trump to be authentic.
According to a CNN/ORC poll last week, when asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination race, four in 10 said Trump.
The situation changed towards the end of July, when four out of 10 would have bet on Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: In the past, GOP voters did not read the future very well.
In the same period of the last election, four out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry for the nomination, compared to only 28% for Mitt Romney.
However, these figures show that the majority of GOP voters consider Trump’s campaign plausible.
Even if the Republicans retreated to another candidate. Trump is still on top of everyone.
Some say the divided situation will likely contribute to Trump’s victory, while support against Trump will spread to more than a dozen candidates.
But a poll conducted in early September by Monmouth University shows that in the hypothetical situation of a collaboration between Trump and most of the other Republican candidates, Trump will almost always benefit from majority support.
Trump is 13 points behind Carly Fiorina, 14 points behind Marco Rubio, 15 points behind Walker, 19 points behind Jeb Bush, and 33 points behind Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
He's almost tied with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to beat him?
Ben Carson would beat the businessman by 19 points in a hypothetical one-on-one showdown.
Most of Donald Trump’s supporters say they have made up their minds.
A new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday found that more than half of voters who support Trump say they are not changing their voting options.
Obviously, a lot can happen in this regard and no one can say that they will never change their minds.
46% say they leave the door open to the possibility of changing their option.
However, Trump’s most important opponent is currently neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they have decided to vote with Trump are twice as likely.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico “rapists” in his campaign opening speech two months ago, immigration has been the focus of the 2016 campaign.
Some are worried that Trump’s bombastic style will lead to a split between prominent Hispanic voters and the Republican Party and hurt rebranding efforts.
But according to the ABC/Post poll on Monday, six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
So it seems that as long as the immigration issue remains in the spotlight, so will Doland Trump.
Frustration with the authorities reaches new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now backed by nearly half of Republican voters, largely because of their status as outsiders.
According to the ABC/Post poll on Monday, six in 10 Republicans say they prefer a political outsider to someone with government experience.
People are also angry at the authorities in Washington.
A survey conducted two weeks ago in Iowa by the Des Moines Register/Bloomberg shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated by the performance of the Republicans in COngres, 54% declaring themselves "dissatisfied" and 21% "nervous at the top".
Jeremy Corbyn makes his Prime Minister's Questions debut
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn’s debut at PMQs has been long awaited.
The new Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, would later make his Prime Minister's Questions debut, confronting David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will ask the first of the six questions he is entitled to shortly after lunch; his performance is likely to be closely scrutinised by the media and Labour MPs.
During his weekly appearances, he called for "less theatre and more facts".
He also said that he can give up a few appearances and give them up to his colleagues.
The clash will be Corbyn's first parliamentary test as leader, coming after he named a "ghost cabinet" and after his speech Tuesday at the annual TUC congress.
Meanwhile, the Labour Party leader's decision to keep silent about the national anthem at a service on Tuesday to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain drew criticism from some Conservative MPs and kept the front page of newspapers.
Mr Corbyn’s decision not to sing the national anthem has drawn attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had "kept his silence respectfully" and acknowledged "the heroism of the British Air Force in the Battle of Britain".
But a member of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC's Two's Newsnight that he would have recommended the Labour leader to sing the national anthem "regardless" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Around a dozen ministers in the shadow cabinet refused to be part of Mr Corbyn's senior team, arguing over differences of opinion over economics, defence and foreign affairs, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party backed him as leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says policy differences "cumulate" in the Labour Party after Mr Corbyn's appointment on his stance towards the European Union and benefit limit.
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that the Labour Party would make changes to remove the idea of limitation altogether.
A few hours later, Mr Smith, the Labour and Pensions Minister, said the party was "very clear" in its exclusive opposition to the government's plans to reduce the "head" level from <0xC2><0xA3>26,000 to <0xC2><0xA3>23,000.
Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader to face Cameron in the last decade since he took over as Conservative leader.
The Labour leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, says he has ideas “from outside sources” for questions to ask Mr Cameron and has received over 30,000 suggestions.
MP Islington North said the PMQs involved too high a level of confrontation and would refrain from aftershocks and attacks, pledging instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the finance minister, would take his place in the PMQs when he is unable to attend - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad.
He also voiced the idea that he would allow other colleagues to speak occasionally, saying he had approached House Speaker John Bercow to discuss the issue.
In 2005, when he took the helm, Mr Cameron said he wanted to give up the "Punch and Judy" style of politics often associated with the PMQs but admitted a few years later that he had failed in his endeavours.
Since its first broadcast in 1990, PMQs has been considered a key barometer of a leader's reasoning, his leadership of the Chamber of Deputies, and his standing among fellow MPs, though critics say it has become a caricature and in need of profound reform.
"Framework in Joburg": Homeless youth benefit from photography courses
It's hard to be a homeless man in Johannesburg.
But a group of people who lived on the streets as children have found a way to learn a trade and earn a living.
“I was shot in Joburg” is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless young people to take pictures of the areas where they live and make money from it.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of the project.
Head of JD Sports says higher salaries could hurt expansion
JD Sports President Peter Cowgill says an increase in the minimum wage in the UK could mean “greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers.”
But that purchasing power is unlikely to exceed higher labor costs within the firm, he says.
The costs could impact JD Sports’ expansion plans, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Thanasi Kokkinakis backed by Tennis Australia President Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis would deserve to be praised and not criticized for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was collateral victim in the "storm" created around his friend Nick Kyrgios, and his behavior deserves rather praise and not criticism, in the opinion of the president of Tennis Australia, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the younger part of the talented duo often referred to as "Special Ks," was dragged uncomfortably into the limelight by the outrageous skid Kyrgios had on Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a scorching qualification match played shortly after, in Cincinnati, the chair umpire had to intervene twice to separate Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, after which Harrison said, "Wawrinka should have put this Kyrgios down, and I should have put him down."
Although he was last seen smashing a rocket after having muscle cramps and missing a possible U.S. Open tournament, angered by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was firmly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, where he is battling Sam Groth for second place in the individual, following Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against England.
“One thing I feel strong is that, in my opinion, Thanasi has been drawn a little bit into the conflict,” Healy said.
The truth is that he broke a rocket when he lost because of cramps in the US, but he is not the first player to break a rocket out of frustration with himself and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he would not be proud of it.
But let's face it, he's mastered some pretty challenging situations in the U.S. with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of confidence.
He's got a great team, he's got a great family, and I think he's been treated unfairly.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, he works hard and has integrated himself into the team, he has had no conflict with the other players, he is highly respected in the locker room, he trains hard, he is in excellent shape, he is a very balanced and mature young man and I think he deserves to be judged exclusively on his qualities and flaws.
Healy also backed the decision not to take Kyrgios into account for the important draw match, which starts on Friday, and described the "joint decision" as the most suitable for everyone, but he backed the return of the long-term Canberra native to the team.
“First of all, we want the team to focus fully on the draw and not to think at all about the controversy around [Kyrgios],” Healy said.
And I think that Nick climbed very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray have said, he is maturing in front of the public and has made some terrible mistakes and deserves to be criticized, but we are trying to support him, we are trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions and I think that he needs a good time when he is not at the center.
2016 Election: Hillary Clinton’s lead over Bernie Sanders halved in national polls
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still has a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for national nomination, but Senator Bernie Sanders is gaining ground.
Clinton is now backed by 47 percent of Democratic voters (down from 58 percent), while Sanders is second with 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he will run for president, is backed by 15 percent of Democratic voters.
At least five months before the start of primary elections, most Democratic voters say it is too early to say they have decided on the candidate they will support.
But Clinton’s supporters are firmer in their choice than the supporters of other candidates.
Compared to the CBS News poll last month, Clinton lost ground in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders gained a few percentage points.
Clinton retains the advantage among women and moderates, but the advantage has shrunk.
Support among men has dropped considerably and Sanders is just 5 points behind.
Clinton’s lead among Democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, now tied with Sanders.
However, Clinton is still in the lead among older voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders by a double-digit percentage among liberals, but Sanders now has a slight five-point lead in this group.
About half of Democratic voters nationwide say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were elected to run on behalf of the party.
A quarter would support it somewhat reservedly and another 15% would support it just because it represents the party.
Six percent would not support it.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the likelihood of Clinton’s current supporters being enthusiastic about her choice is high.
Opinions are more mixed among those who do not currently support Clinton — only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, the number of Republican voters who say the same about first-place, Donald Trump (35 percent) is smaller.
When Clinton’s supporters are asked an open-ended question about why they would want her to win the race, the majority answer is that she has the right experience (16%), followed by the time for a woman to be president (13%), and that she is the best candidate for this office (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mention her association with Bill Clinton (9%).
There is also agreement on these aspects and eligibility.
Given that the vice president is considering a possible presidential run, 57 percent of Democratic voters would like to see him in the race — though a third think he shouldn’t be running.
When asked about the second option for the party’s representative, Democratic voters call Biden a majority.
Of Clinton’s supporters, more than half say Biden would be second, well ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run in the Democratic race, Hillary Clinton’s lead over Sanders increases from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points if he does not run.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters consider Clinton the candidate with the greatest chance of winning the general election; but the numbers have dropped from 78 percent last month.
Biden is in second place, but the percentage according to which he is the most eligible has increased.
However, when asked what is most important to an elected candidate, Democratic voters prefer issues over eligibility.
Like last month, no Democratic candidate or potential candidate is considered by these voters to be unacceptable as the party’s representative in the presidential race.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates do well in terms of a few key characteristics vis-<0xC3><0xA0>-vis their party’s primary voters.
Most voters consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be upright and trustworthy and to have strong leadership qualities.
Biden is best seen among the three in terms of integrity, while Clinton’s strong point is leadership.
Thirty percent of Democratic voters don’t believe Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many as those who say so about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don’t have an opinion about him.
Democratic voters also generally view the three, Clinton, Sanders and Biden, as having the same ideologies as themselves.
On all these issues, about a quarter of Democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
With questions persisting about Hillary Clinton’s use of a personal email address and a server as secretary of state, most Democratic voters are pleased with her explanation of the issue and say it has not affected their overall view of the candidate.
But things are different for the American public.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion split on the issue in March, shortly after the issue came to light.
A majority of Americans say the email controversy has not affected their overall opinion of Clinton, although 36 percent say they have changed their mind negatively.
Mainly Republicans, more than six in 10, say they have changed their view of Clinton in a negative way.
Although Democratic voters consider Clinton to be integrity and trustworthiness, this continues to raise problems among voters overall: only 32 percent consider her to be integrity and trustworthiness, 8 percent less than last month and 15 percent less than in May.
62% of voters do not consider it to be integrity and trustworthiness.
At the same time, 55 percent of voters nationwide do not consider Trump to be upright and trustworthy.
However, both Clinton and Trump have white balls for leadership.
Of the six candidates evaluated, Biden, Carson and Bush rank first in terms of integrity.
The number of those who consider Sanders to be upright is higher than those who disagree, but as with Carson, many don’t have an opinion of him.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 primary Democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Five Brotherhood Members Charged with Killing Student in Year 1 at Baruch College
Nearly two years after a college student lost his life during an initiation ritual in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, five people have been charged with murder.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity at Baruch College in New York brutally attacked Chun “Michael” Deng during an initiation ritual in September 2013 and postponed taking him to the hospital, which contributed to his death, according to police statements.
Official sources say the victim was blindfolded, put behind him a 14kg backpack filled with sand and repeatedly beaten while trying to make his way to a target on frozen ground.
Mr. Deng accused of headaches after which he lost consciousness.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity did not call the emergency number after he fainted and claim they would have waited an hour before taking him to the hospital, police say.
They found the time to change Deng’s clothes, Google his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, the fraternity’s national president, for advice, police chief Chris Wagner told a news conference.
“At this point, the members began to hide their personal belongings and put the good of the fraternity before the good of Michael Deng,” Wagner said.
He could not be resuscitated and died the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng suffered repeated trauma to his head, torso and thighs.
“Too many families have been devastated by the rites of brotherhood, since 1970 at least one student has lost his life every year because of the rites,” Douglas Fierberg, Deng’s family lawyer, said in a statement.
Fraternities and their members must be held accountable and this measure taken by the authorities is important.
The Monroe County grand jury recommended that the first five members be charged with third-degree murder.
Thirty-two other members of the fraternity, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with assault and accessory to murder.
“We want to hold accountable not only the people involved but, if there is an organization that has authorized the fraternity, officially or unofficially, we will also hold it accountable,” Wagner told a news conference on Tuesday.
Baruch faculty banned the fraternity and the national fraternity withdrew its affiliation with the local representation.
Here's What Will Happen When The Federal Reserve Raises The Interest Rate
The interest rate will rise and the bull market will stumble, bond yields will rise and the economy will go into recession.
That's what we know.
What we don’t know is how long it will happen and how long it will last.
In economics, history offers few clues as to the time frame.
After the first interest rate hike, the recession occurred in just 11 months and lasted 86 months.
The Federal Reserve’s aggressiveness to raise interest rates is often, though not always, a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets respond.
That is why U.S. central bank officials have emphasized so strongly that investors should not focus on when the interest rate starts to rise but on the trajectory of the time needed for normalization.
There are many variables at play.
But in the end, market players might find that all the fuss about raising the interest rate has been overblown.
“The Fed’s first rate hike since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a sign of the ‘cheap money’ era,” Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to more normal but still low levels to be the seismic shock that everyone seems to fear.
But it cannot be said that there will be no effects.
Below we present how some sectors of the economy could react, based on historical trends:
Given the situation that the market has faced in recent months, the anticipation of interest rate growth can volatilize things for a while.
But at the moment of growth, the impact is not so dramatic.
“There seems to be a trend for capital returns to stagnate for 12-24 months after the first increase, which may again reflect the monetary policy lapse,” Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what will happen after the Fed rises.
Specifically, in the last 35 years, the market has risen sharply - by about 14 percent - heading towards the interest rate increase, quite unchanged in the period of 250 days after (average rise of 2.6%) after which it returns to normal after 500 days, with an average recovery in the last six cycles of 14.4%, according to a recent analysis published on Barron’s Asvet by the strateul <0xC8><0x99>e<0xC8><0x99>en.
Deutsche said the impact on equities tends to become more pronounced later in the interest rate growth cycle and the benefits are starting to wane.
Recession is a reality of economic life, but rising interest rates often contribute to it.
In the current situation, the Fed is facing conditions that have not existed before and that could accelerate a recession.
Specifically, gross domestic product will approach its historical low for an increase in the Fed’s interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, of the 118 interest rate hikes since 1950, only twice nominal GDP was less than 4.5%.
Even though the value in the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6%, few expect the situation to persist, with the third quarter only reaching 1.5%, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Raising interest rates in such a fragile economy could be risky and could raise the question “if this time is different,” Deutsche said.
Market players have been gearing up all year for a Fed growth decision, with all eyes on this week’s meeting of the Federal Open Market Commission, which closes on Thursday.
Although many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an interest rate increase at this meeting, forward transactions indicate a probability of only 25%.
“In our post-1950 study, all interest rate growth cycles to date have been in a super cycle of profit growth, with GDP eclipsing pre-recession peaks very quickly after recovery began,” the report said.
On the contrary, this was a strangely slow recovery from the worst recession of the period under review.
The current cycle is by far the longest expected by the Fed since the end of the last recession; the record had been 35 months, and it reached 74 months and continues.
Fixed income was also volatile given that the market expects interest rate growth and the pattern is somewhat similar to that of dividends.
The main difference is that the impact is faster on bonds than on stocks when the Fed changes policy.
In the case of bonds, it seems that the benefits change direction as soon as the first increase/decrease in the cycle occurs.
At the end of the interest rate growth cycle, bond yields immediately fall," Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab’s strategies are of the opinion that these interest rate increases will bring short-term and long-term bonds closer to profitability by flattening the curve.
High-yield bonds do better in such an environment, although “we’re still cautious about forcing profitability,” Kathy Jones, a fixed-income analyst at Schwab, said in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already adapted to the Fed’s policy expectations.
“In addition to the strength of the dollar and lower estimated inflation, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of more rigorous monetary policy,” Jones wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is fairer, the average credit interest rate spread has expanded, and volatility has risen — all market characteristics when the Fed tightens policy.
Broadly speaking, companies operating mostly in the U.S. will benefit from rising interest rates and local products will become more attractive.
Multinationals with large debts will suffer because the growth of the dollar will lead to their products becoming more expensive in the global market space and their debt will be more expensive.
“History shows that ‘quality’ stocks tend to be more profitable in the three months following an initial interest rate increase,” Goldman Sachs said in a report to clients.
Firms with strong balance sheets outperformed those with weak balance sheets after each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004, by an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with large capital gains and low volatility stocks also outperformed similar companies with lower quality, with an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
Debt will become an important issue.
Companies with a high percentage of floating debt have the most to lose, Goldman says.
Consumers will also benefit from the dollar’s rise.
Those who save could also gain, although experts disagree about how quickly this will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham slammed the radio station for being “stupid”
It says it is increasingly similar to the commercial opponent
He also took aim at the BBC Music Awards, claiming they plagiarized the Brits.
Colleague Damien Collins attacked The Voice, saying this show is not original either
BBC Radio 3 is “transforming into” Classic FM, a senior lawmaker said, putting pressure on the station to prove it is doing something commercial stations don’t do.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC chiefs that the public radio station is "dumb" and looking more and more like the commercial adversary.
“I feel like Radio 3 is ‘dumb’ – although I don’t like to use the word – but I feel like it’s turning into Classic FM,” he said.
The BBC Music Awards were launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, launched last year, appear to be Brits under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different - these are the two examples that come to mind that just copy what's already on the market," Mr Bingham said.
The BBC's director general has denied the allegations, saying that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial opponent in terms of live music and audience education.
I won't find out anything about classical music from Radio 3.
And his commitment to live music and production is unrivalled.
“In addition, I think it’s also important Radio 3’s commitment to discovering new music and allocating new songs,” he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 editor Alan Davey said he needed to do more to attract audiences than in the previous period because Britons had less knowledge of classical music.
But Radio 3 was not the only item under the BBC logo criticised at the Culture, Media and Sport Commission meeting for following in the footsteps of its commercial rivals.
Conservative MP Damien Collins has attacked The Voice - the talent show bought by the BBC from Dutch producer Talpa Media for around <0xC2><0xA3>22 million.
Do you understand why there are often discussions related to the respective show because it is not original and is not distinguished by anything?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George on the jury - be done "in a BBC-specific way."
He added that he wants the Corporation to “find the golden-egg chicken in its own backyard” the next time it launches an entertainment show.
However, he refused to ban future seasons of The Voice or spend the money going on licenses on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales registered the smallest increase in August and Black Friday could be to blame
In the first three months of 2015, online sales increased by 7%.
The last month saw the slowest increase since 2000.
Online sales picked up three years ago, thanks to the use of mobile phones to shop.
Experts believe that Black Friday in November could determine the reluctance to spend.
For over a decade, online shopping has exploded and turned Britain’s shopping streets into ghost towns.
But experts say there are signs that online sales are shrinking, with the latest figures indicating only a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total money spent in August showed the smallest increase since 2000, with an increase of only 5% in the last year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are shrinking, with the latest figures indicating an increase of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
“If you look at the growth in previous years and go back to 2000, there has always been a tendency to rationalize over time,” Andy Mulcahy, an editor at the IMRG sales index, told the Guardian.
He explained that online sales picked up three years ago when shoppers started using their mobile phones to shop.
Thus, the number of people who could shop online increased and could do so under various circumstances, such as on the couch.
But now that it’s stagnant a little bit, you might notice a decrease (in growth).
The Black Friday phenomenon, imported from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
In the opinion of specialists, buyers would refrain from making purchases before the event that takes place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times the average number of shoppers flocked to computers to grab deals, which led to the collapse of several retailers’ websites.
Specialists believe that Black Friday, when buyers fought over bargains, could determine the reluctance of buyers.
A study published by the British Retail Consortium determined that at least <0xC2><0xA3>1 out of every <0xC2><0xA3>5 is spent online.
For certain products, such as TVs and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are currently made through online shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people prefer to buy clothes and shoes online rather than resorting to fashion stores in shopping areas.
After Sanctioning Bin Laden Family, Muslims Bury Victims Killed After Crane Crash in Mecca
The bodies of 29 of those who lost their lives were paraded through the streets by Muslims, with the first funeral taking place in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia has partly blamed construction giant Saudi Binladin Group for the collapse.
The health minister said a total of 394 people were injured after the crane collapsed.
In the street-walking ceremony, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims killed by a collapsed crane at the mosque in Mecca.
Dressed in white, mourners joined the procession to express their condolences, until the first dead man arrived at the end of the final journey, at the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The sad memory preserved by the holy place, where just a few days ago a construction crane collapsed through the ceiling of the mosque, falling on the faithful.
The bodies were released for funerals after the King of Saudi Arabia sanctioned the bin Laden family's construction group for the disaster, which also left 394 people injured.
In a street ceremony, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims killed by a collapsed crane at the mosque in Mecca.
Among the victims was the father of four children, Qasim Akram of Bolton, Great Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr. Akram was in the Grand Mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual hajj pilgrimage.
Saudi authorities have already promised that the hajj pilgrimage to Mecca will continue, with thousands of pilgrims still arriving in the city.
Today, King Salman stated that the Binladin Group should not have left the crane arm raised when the crane was not in operation.
An Arab version of the decree, published by the Saudi Press Agency, said the Binladin Group was partly to blame for the collapse.
The English-language service of the news agency did not elaborate, but said the company’s leaders had been banned from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the crane to collapse in the courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims came before the hajj pilgrimage later this month.
The Binladin Group has not yet made any statements about the crane collapse and representatives of the Group could not be contacted for statements.
The royal decree blamed the group for not using up-to-date safety measures and failing to coordinate its work with the meteorological authorities.
Dozens of cranes surround the Great Mosque of Mecca as part of the massive construction effort led by the Binladin Group.
For several decades, the Binladin family has had a close relationship with the royal family of Saudi Arabia and is carrying out major construction projects.
The last Al Qaeda leader, Osama bin Laden, was a “renegade” son, disinherited from the family in the 1990s.
The collapse occurred in conditions of strong wind and rain, just days before the arrival of millions of people in the kingdom to participate in the pilgrimage, an essential journey at least once in the life of every physically fit Muslim.
Authorities say 158 people remain in the hospital.
Authorities decided that relatives of the deceased should receive one million Saudi Rials (<0xC2><0xA3>174,000) and the same amount should be paid to those with permanent injuries.
The injured will receive half of this amount.
Advantages and Disadvantages of Converting Credits to Swiss Francs
Two offers for the conversion of Swiss franc loans into lei have already appeared on the banking market, the main advantages being the exclusion of currency risk and the reduction of rates.
Disadvantages can come in a few years, when variable interest can lead to higher rates.
Banca Transilvania has just completed the process of converting loans into francs granted by Volksbank, and Bancpost has announced the conversion offer for its own clients.
According to the data compiled by analysts of the financial portal FinZoom, Bancpost offers three years of fixed interest on lei, 1.5%, the lowest on the market.
On the other hand, Banca Transilvania’s conversion offer was accepted by 83% of clients with franc loans due to two successive reductions: the balance was reduced with the amount of risk and administration fees paid by the client, then an additional reduction of 22.5% was applied to the balance in lei.
Both offers reduce the rates of their own customers, compared to the monthly payment equivalent in lei before conversion.
Thus, Banca Transilvania reduces the rate by 42.5% and Bancpost by 33% in the first three years and, theoretically, by 18% in the following years.
BENEFITS
The main advantage of CHF loans is that the currency risk is eliminated, the consumer is protected from future increases in the franc, and the credit will be repaid in the currency in which he collects his salary.
Another major advantage of both conversion offers is that there is no reassessment of the property, no additional guarantees and another proof of income.
Basically, there will not be a new financial and legal analysis of the credit, nor will there be additional costs as in the case of a refinancing.
Also, both banks offer a discount at the monthly rate, compared to how much customers pay before conversion, equivalent in lei.
Risks
The problem is that the rate in the first years is made up more of the interest, and the customer pays very little of the principal.
The Bancpost offer with very low interest rate in the first three years seems advantageous for customers.
However, it is not known how this rate will evolve after three years.
The margin offered to customers can be more than 3.25%, so on the whole, and the cost reduction is lower.
A possible risk for all loans in lei with variable interest rate is that the ROBOR index will grow significantly in the coming years (more than the Libor - CHF index).
For example, ROBOR at three months is now 1.44%, but in 2013 it had reached the value of 6%, in 2009, over 15%, and in a few days of 2008 it exceeded 40%!
In addition, other costs, not mentioned in the initial offer, may also arise.
The time has come for interest rate decisions for the U.S. Federal Reserve.
The world is looking ahead to the meeting scheduled for two days later, on Wednesday and Thursday, when the U.S. Federal Reserve will make the crucial decision of whether to raise the interest rate for the first time in about a decade.
In a Reuters poll of 80 economists, just over half of whom last week thought the decision would be made, I now believe that the situation will hold for a while and that interest rates will be kept in the current range of 0-0.25%.
It’s a historic event because it’s been seven years since the Federal Reserve brought rates to zero.
For the first time, we are facing a situation where a major central bank could drop the zero rate and start a process of normalizing interest rates,” said Angel Ubide, chief analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has performed relatively well, with the recovery bringing trillions of dollars into the balance sheet and generating low inflation.
But the Federal Reserve should not ignore the less rosy global situation.
He warned markets to prepare for growth but there are signs that even they believe such a move is unlikely.
The decision will be announced on Tuesday, 20:00 CET.
People who have lost their charm
The actor (left), along with his son Redmond (right), has been going through stressful situations in recent years.
In 2001 he battled leukemia and in 2009 he lost his life partner, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer.
It is also rumored that the actor faced the problem of drug use and in 2008 he was arrested for drug possession.
All of this certainly comes at a cost.
Manchester United player Luke Shaw is on the stand for several months due to double fractures.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture to his right foot in Manchester United's Champions League match, which ended in a defeat to PSV Eindhoven.
After the event that brought tears to the player's eyes and that will keep him on the stand for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains optimistic that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The accident followed a reckless intervention by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after 20-year-old Shaw breached PSV's defence.
He received medical care for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He has a double fracture in his leg and he's in the hospital."
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe the day after then he'll be operated in Manchester.
It’s awful – a boy who came to Manchester United when he was 18, he has difficulties, then he plays fantastic and now something like that happens.
The oxygen mask was placed in the dressing room.
She was crying.
I am not a doctor, but at double fracture rest is six months and will not play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
It seems that Moreno was lucky and escaped the red card and the concession of a penalty kick.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian official was wrong.
You can judge for yourself when they say it's foul and red card.
It was a very ugly, two-legged intervention.
A message on Shaw’s Twitter account read: “Thank you all for the messages, I have no words to express how weak I feel, I am starting the road to recovery, I will come back stronger.”
Manchester United hit by Luke Shaw's injury in PSV defeat
The England defender has one more reason to recover to play at the European Championship in France next June.
PSV coach Phillip Cocu said: "It's a very ugly injury."
Everyone is very sad when a player suffers such an injury.
Our players never aim to injure an opponent.
Moreno broke his leg playing for the Mexico national team against the Netherlands national team led by Van Gaal at the 2014 World Cup.
“It is very difficult for him because he did not intend to hurt his opponent, and when he hears that it is a very serious injury, it is not good,” Cocu said.
I didn't see the phase.
I could only see the ball, which was heading in a different direction, so it looked like [Moreno] touched it but I couldn’t see the intervention on Luke.
In a statement to SBS6, Moreno said: “I know what it’s like, I know how difficult it is to go through something like this.
I feel so bad, I'm so sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado also arrived at the hospital after an intervention by Chris Smalling.
Adam Lyth has clearly risked England's omission but is still holding on
The victory against Pakistan in the UAE is a difficult task but, after seeing the team selected by England for the tournament, I do not consider a repeat of the 3-0 defeat in the test matches.
I wouldn’t rule out a victory on the move.
Alastair Cook’s team may have less experience than three years ago but it has good players on the batting line and collective morale is strong; they will not be marked by the events of 2012 but will have a positive youthful attitude.
Moeen Ali evolves as a spinner and Adil Rashid, even if he is unknown at the test level, represents an option for the attack.
Adam Lyth left the England team for the test matches and was replaced by Alex Hales
Obviously, as his head coach at Yorkshire, it is difficult for me to analyse the decision not to select Adam Lyth for the team.
He played the seven test matches against two good strikers under difficult conditions, and the simple but harsh reality is that cricketers are judged by results.
There were no question marks about Joe Root, for example, until the announcements were made because – and I’ve said this before – players are their own picks.
About fifty years and maybe Lyth would have extended his run but his destiny is in his hands.
I hope that if he makes more runs for Yorkshire he will have other opportunities.
England’s head coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude even when the performance was not up to his ability and I’m not surprised at that; first of all, he’s a team player.
It’s hard to answer the question of how long a batsman gets noticed in test matches.
Lyth had seven runs — like Sam Robson before him — while Nick Compton had nine.
Only Compton was lucky at home and on the move.
The only complaint you can have was that England preferred Jonathan Trott on the Caribbean tour - when Lyth was in top form - but that missed opportunity is a thing of the past.
There's Alex Hales, a batsman that I rate very highly.
He’s a cricketer who has the ‘X factor’ and we noticed early in Yorkshire this season when he scored 236 against us at a Trent Bridge pitch.
It should be given at least the same opportunity as those before it, but this will of course depend on the composition of the UAE team.
The idea was launched for Moeen to open the fight with Cook, which would lead to extra spinner keeping four quicks at the same time, and I have nothing against it.
I don't see why a pitcher couldn't hit there and this left-handed player has already proven that he's screwed.
Moeen may not have brought success to his district of Worcestershire, but he was No. 3 for them, so the difference is not great.
My old teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 test matches as a first drop before entering the open in 2001.
It immediately erased three centuries and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari comes on the team as a back-up spinner and although I had limited contact with him, it struck me that he is a very impressive young man.
People might judge his young age — with an average of 31 at bat and 35 at the ball — and they might think it’s the point, but there aren’t a lot of spinners and the picks have opted for youth.
He will learn a lot from this tour.
England also made some changes to the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, batsman of Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the test matches could be a masterstroke.
He is one of the best players and will bring a lot of experience, given that he played in any situation and against all types of attacks.
Paul Collingwood is coming for the white-ball leg of the tour and will bring both energy and relentless ambition.
I always thought he was born to be involved in international cricket, either as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela, he has intuition.
Sometimes, new voices in the locker room, even if they transmit messages that have been transmitted before, can bring fresh air to the team.
Colly Durham’s teammate Ben Stokes is resting for the one-day matches, Root got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with that.
Although not everyone agrees, coaches and coaches do not make the program.
And you have to remember, the jobs of the players depend on the results they get.
Such decisions are never easy.
The Brexit camp could win if the economy stays calm until 2017
With the passing of the day, David Cameron’s renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting more and more messy, even without the choice of the brilliant Jeremy “Yes or no?” Corbyn at the helm of the Labour Party or TUC brings serious criticism to Europe on Tuesday.
Strangers also have characters like Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat explained in recent days that - immersed in crises similar to the one in the EU - not all of which are caused internally - some member states are fed with the UK's agenda of concessions and treaty changes, which most do not want.
In Brighton, on the occasion of the annual meeting, the TUC decided that they too would not want this if it eroded social protection.
We could even call it Dave and George’s “selfie” agenda.
The prime minister and chancellor attend bilateral summits or sessions in foreign capitals, take a picture in front of a famous local monument, with or without a local representative, then return home and declare that they have won allies for reform.
It's just about me.
My European friend, who wants a Britain with an outside perspective under the EU roof – “Don’t leave us alone with France,” Berlin says – suggests that several ministers and obtuse officials from certain capitals have reached the point where they don’t care whether they stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, the extremely cautious German chancellor, is an ally but has been in charge for 10 years and wants to leave the position before her situation falters, as happened with Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16), who stayed too long.
In 2017, French President Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande will be re-elected or replaced.
And his power is in decline.
Poland may soon have a right-wing nationalist government, Spain a left-wing one.
It is hard to believe that they will help the English who are posing, whose energy would be better used to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK – something they do not want either because most have similar separatist tendencies.
Thus, some ministers may even plan to intentionally make remarks that do not help, in the SNP style, in the campaign for the 2017 UK referendum to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suggests.
“The renegotiation was fixed” and “the UK got nothing of value out of the renegotiation.”
Europeans know for a fact how overpowering Fleet Street can be and how skeptical the oligarchic media barons who regard the EU with skepticism are, because they did not participate in the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn who ratified our 1973 entry in a 2:1 ratio.
Perhaps they vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the Euro-opportunist, who became famous in the early 1990s when he was corresponding to Brussels.
Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included a mix of tax-defensive crooks, foreign phone fraudsters and pseudo non-domes who own most of the major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair saw them in much the same way, but he realized that when you’re stuck in a cage with a nervous gorilla, you have to give them bananas to distract them from the thought of eating yourself for lunch and back to tea.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairite than Blair in his opposition to Cameron's referendum idea, given that Blair made a concession on principle to the abandoned EU constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who gave him an exit card.
The press didn't forgive him for that either.
But Jeremy Corbyn, who touched me on my back on Monday at Westminster – I told him not to waste any more time with me – seems to be in danger of adopting the Murdoch strategy of boycotting Neil Kinnock in the 80s, a mistake then and now.
It may take time, but it must develop a coherent strategy of cooperation with the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr whose position at the BBC left it vacant on Sunday.
Corbyn’s official position towards Europe is what I would indulgently call evolution.
He says he would like to remain in a reformed EU.
The majority of those who disagree with the “Anglicanism” of conservatives might agree with this.
That’s what Hilary “A Benn, but not a Bennite” Benn said on radio and TV this week, when the scout in him struggled not to acknowledge that Corbyn’s appointment of John McDonnell as “shadow” minister on financial matters was a bad idea.
He reminded me of the 70s, when his father fought on TV to be disloyal to his Labour colleagues, without going too far and without losing his position in the cabinet.
Hilary's fight was more attractive.
But the fight to stay “in any situation” – Benn’s expression – does not correspond with what McDonnell said, nor with what the JC told colleagues and parliamentarians at the private meeting on Monday night.
Regardless of the image Corbyn wants to convey—remember, it sensitized me—the discipline of messaging remains important in the age of television, and especially in the whirlwind of social media, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right that Cameron should not be given a favour note in Europe, allowing him to welcome Labour’s support in the referendum campaign, McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly believes this.
But McDonnell and Corbyin’s basic sophistry about EU membership – consistent with their anti-capitalist past – is no longer just an esoteric discussion among leftist dissidents for whom the narcissism of small differences is a central dogma.
As with his NATO sophistry – Tom Watson is adamant that the JC will not campaign for renunciation – foreign diplomats will be forced to try to understand.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital – and there are suspicious voters there – for concessions to Britain when everything could be pointless?
The U.S. is already quite disappointed about the poor military performance of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a conservative government cutting costs, as I was reminded at the launch of the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Specialists criticize the decision of the Department of Public Health of England on e-cigarettes
According to the researchers, claims by a government agency that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting between 12 people, some of them with ties to the tobacco industry.
Specialists from the editorial team of the British Medical Journal (BMJ) have joined the Lancet in criticising the evidence used by the Department of Public Health in England (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the “reference” report last month and described it as a “complex analysis of the evidence.”
But some researchers have questioned the robustness of the data and pointed to links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An article published last month in the medical journal Lancet attacked the “extraordinarily fragile basis” on which PHE founded its main conclusion.
Two other researchers writing in the BMJ questioned the claims and their substantiation “on solid earth or quicksand.”
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: “A fundamental principle of public health is that policies must be based on evidence of effectiveness.”
They said they expected PHE’s claims that “current estimates show e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking” to be based on a detailed analysis of evidence and models.
In fact, a single meeting of 12 people led to the development of a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) model to synthesize their views on the negative effects associated with different nicotine-containing products; the results of this meeting were briefly presented in a research paper.
McKee and Capewell said one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose chief executive was said to have received funding in the past from British American Tobacco for conducting an independent study.
It also validated BAT’s public health accreditation in a sustainability report, he said.
They added that one of the 12 participants in the meeting stated the funding received from an e-cigarette manufacturer but not the funding that is reported to have been received from the cigarette and tobacco company, Philip Morris International.
The arguments on the basis of which the panel members were selected were not provided, but among them are a few "frontiers" known in the production of electronic cigarettes, some of whom even declare in the paper the financing of the industry.
Other participants in the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the head of the tobacco control section of PHE.
The group’s research paper “mocks convincingly” that there is “a lack of solid evidence of the harmful effect that most products have by most criteria,” McKee and Capewell said.
However, none of these links or limitations are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said PHE’s claims that “to date there is no evidence that e-cigarettes are a factor encouraging smoking among children or non-smokers” are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of PHE’s health department, says he has responded to BMJ’s claims in the past.
He said: “E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking.”
One in two people who have smoked for their entire lives lose their lives because of this addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the risk e-cigarettes pose to health is comparatively minor, but we need to continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about the information that emerges and the information that does not emerge from the evidence, in particular in view of the high degree of public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Every year, around 80,000 people lose their lives to a smoking-related disease and the annual costs to the national health system from smoking amount to <0xC2><0xA3>2 billion.
By clearly expressing the current evidence - namely that, although the use of e-cigarettes is not risk-free, they only present a fraction of the harmful effect of smoking - we are fulfilling our national duty.

Advertisements That Shame Britain's Arms Trade
Watch the film made by Amnesty International against the arms fair.
Horrible killer drones!
Beast for crushing the ankles!
Dispersion bombs!
And electric batons that cause creepy pain without leaving a trace!
The cheerful voice and animated images leave no doubt that this ad for the world’s largest arms fair is a scathing charade, made by Amnesty International to highlight the British authorities’ desire to sell arms to repressive regimes through Defence and Security Equipment International at the ExCeL Centre in London’s Docklands.
DSEI Arms Fair: Authoritarian Regimes Arrive in London
But a separate campaign has also led to a large number of posters being displayed in bus stations and metros that need a second look.
“An important announcement, are you travelling with the DLR between 15 and 18 September?” says one of the announcements, using the fonts and branding of the London Underground, the DLR line turning into the image of a tank.
In September of this year, a lot of arms dealers will pounce on the DLR Customers are being asked to contribute to stopping the arms fair.
The 300 posters are made by artists who have exhibited their work at the Cruel Designs Museum in Dismaland, Banksy.
A group called Special Patrol Group contributed to the distribution in London using "Ad Space Hack Packs", a 6-pound package of Allen keys which they claim "facilitates access to about a third of the advertising space in bus stations on the planet."
The London transport director is not amused by this “vandalism” in the form of steering wheels.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly asking questions and seeking to make political works accessible to the public outside galleries.
Many artists are moving towards collaborating with activists in protest movements, realizing that they must go out into the real world for their art to have an impact on society.
Another poster against the arms trade that greets commuters traveling by subway.
The film made by Amnesty had over 100,000 views on Facebook in 24 hours and was created by the advertising agency VCCP who worked pro bono, and the graphic designer and the artist who dubbed the voice also worked for free.
VCCP’s creative director, Matt Lever, was shocked by the silence surrounding the ad for the arms fair – with an empty space in the ExCel calendar – and thought, “Let’s give them the campaign they’re trying to avoid.”
They played with making a more realistic advertisement but "enriching it with animations and strong colors, it was more striking".
“They have done a great job in helping us to increase our interest in selling illegal torture equipment at the fair,” said Tom Davies, Amnesty International’s Executive Director.
Now, the UK authorities would need to take action and ensure that torture equipment is not illegally traded and delivered to the door.
Perhaps the most creative art form on the theme of the arms fair comes from inside ExCeL, where exhibitors offer fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab disclosed an order received from the U.S. military regarding “AT4CS RS with shoulder-supported launcher.”
This includes “a uniquely shaped warhead that delivers stunning effects behind the armor, inside the target.
Whatever that means, it won't be pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in the home
It’s been 11 years since I moved into the dorm when I was a 19-year-old who still believed in berets and moral relativity, but only now do I remember the forced smiles of those I annoyed — and the many complaints I made to others.
Most of what I’ve learned can be summarized in the form of eight simple rules.
Moving into the home can bring states that range from nervous breakdown to horror.
The chatter is tempting: telling people where you come from, if and where you spent a year off from school, what you think of Corbyn and why “sincerely, you don’t care about Marmite because, really, guys, it’s nothing but HAHAHA yeast extract, you can find me in my room.”
Take a deep breath.
And help others breathe — ask questions and show interest. ————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
They animate the conversation and help you differentiate the people you like from the ones you wouldn’t talk to even if the flood came and they were the only ones who would have boats.
Don't suffocate people.
Dorms often abound with drinks parties, movie nights and social gatherings, but they are also the place where people dress up and try on their underwear.

Introverts get special treatment at the university.
Your bedroom should be a refuge, but in many homes a culture of wandering through bedrooms is built, based on friendship, socialization and lifelong friendships.

Make friends by cooking.
Since you're starting college in Bake-Off fever, if you knock on someone's door to introduce yourself and take a plate of brownies, it seems less awkward, less like the '50s, "Welcome to the neighborhood, I cooked you something, now smile and I ask personal questions."
Home-cooked treats are a great way to make friends.

That’s not just because it’s common sense, but because you’re literally walking on shards.
A girl on the landing with me asked her neighbor to turn the music down because it was 3 a.m. and she had an exam in the morning.

Violinist David Grimal: In Bach’s time there were no world tours.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were working people, artists and not commercial representatives.
The French violinist David Grimal is one of the great artists of our time, known not only as a soloist but also as the initiator of a less ordinary project, which, as he himself says, is "weird", Les Dissonances - an orchestra made up of international classical soloists and talented musicians, who perform a symphonic repertoire without a conductor, and this is the only one who has the right to perform.
Les Dissonances was this year at the Enescu Festival with two performances: a performance, on Sunday, in which David Grimal, the founder of the orchestra, was the soloist, and one on Monday, when the cellist Xavier Phillips was in the foreground, the works composed by Enescu being unmissable.
Both shows, held on the Athenaeum stage, showed the audience a different way of interpreting classical music.
Les Dissonances appeared on the music scene in 2004 being, at that time, the only classical musical ensemble in which there was no conductor.
The conductor is the most important musician for musicians.
True, on the one hand musicians need an education either to become soloists or to become performers in an orchestra - I'm talking about instrumentalists, not composers.
They are trained as "specialized workers".
They feel like they need a conductor.
On the other side of the stage, for the audience, all the musical fetishization is focused on the conductor.
And so the business, the music industry, does its marketing.
We are no longer talking about music.
So if we look at this world, we have on the one hand skilled workers, which is stupid, and an audience that can’t listen, but has to look, which is stupid again.”
The violinist says that this change in the way he makes music came from the "musical disappointments" of his solo career.
I was like a high-level athlete who had to do the same exercise all over the world with different orchestras, to make a lot of money and to bring money and the music industry.
Ten years ago, when I was about 30 years old, I found this very depressing, because I no longer found human creativity and brotherhood in this system.
So, I didn’t find any sense to continue on this path.
So I decided to create Les Dissonances.
This happened in 2004, and at that time no one did so without a conductor: "The musical world, extremely conservative, did not want such projects".
"How do you imagine marketing with a collective of musicians where there is no ego anymore?" asks the artist.
David Grimal acknowledges that Les Dissonaces is "a luxury", stating that none of the musicians who are part of the orchestra does not depend on the success of this project to live.
In the 10 years of existence of the ensemble, the lack of a conductor has not proved to be a hindrance in the musical act: "Intriguingly, the more we sang a more complex repertoire, the simpler it seems, because all musicians are obliged to be present in the opera and not only in the role", says Grimal, adding as at the Sunday performance "there were 74 musicians".
In Grimal's opinion, the Enescu Festival is a "very brave" one, precisely because he also invited Les Dissonances: "An extraordinary festival, where the largest orchestras in the world are present who also sing 3 times a day, and in the middle of these orchestras you have invited this strange group".
In a temple of orchestral tradition, such as the Enescu Festival, there is a place and interest in something different, which breaks barriers.
Speaking of Enescu’s work, the violinist admits that he feels the Romanian music of the famous Romanian composer, so he did not need a special approach when he introduced Enescu’s works into his repertoire.
Grimal notes that Enescu's music is very instinctive, but this is what happens when we talk about George Enescu and Romanian music, "because there is also a George Enescu who made French music".
Grimal argues for a change in the way classical music education is done, considering that "the musician's job, as it is organized today, has a death knell" and that "the future of music represents music itself".
We don't need to go around the world five times a year if it doesn't help.
In Bach’s time there were no world tours.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were working people, who were artists and not commercial representatives.
For me, the organization of concerts, festivals, tours, the release of albums, all are formidable, extraordinary, but as long as they are done in the service of music.
If not, we are in a system where creativity suffers, it no longer has freedom.
To illustrate this phenomenon, David Grimal gave an example of Romanian products before and after joining the European Union: "In Romania, before entering the EU, you had good vegetables and meat".
To enter the EU, you had to pass health laws that are not good for vegetables and meat.
Production and agriculture end up in the service of supermarkets, as is also the case in France.
The same thing happens with music, it’s the same logic.
Les Dissonances makes tomatoes maybe not too beautiful, but when we cut them they are real tomatoes.
In an ideal world, this music should return to the center and the institutions and industries that manage this system understand that music does not need to be sold, but needs to be shared, and this can be done starting with educational policy.
“If we consider – as the Koreans, the Chinese, the Japanese do – that Western music is one of the most beautiful things of humanity, we would reintroduce its learning in school, we would reintroduce concerts on television and through this education we would no longer need to sell musical by-products,” Grimal believes.
Surely, there are things in classical music education that remain very communist, that everywhere, is something very militarized.
It depends on this discipline whether we compare a musician to a soldier, or whether we form a musician who will play an instrument, being, above all, a musician.
We’re talking about a completely different education, if we want to train a soldier, it has to be in a way, if we want to train a musician, it’s something else entirely.
In your opinion, which is more dangerous, a soldier or a musician?” asks the French artist smiling.
Grimal shows that, for artists, the reward of another way of making music comes precisely from the overcoming of this status of "soldier", the overcoming of what "they think are their limits": "Musicians discover at a certain moment that they are not soldiers, and therefore after the concert they come out smiling".
David Grimal spoke about his musical project and his vision of music and the artist in the "Festival of Ideas", a discussion with the public organized within the George Enescu International Festival by the Aspen Romania Institute.
Profile David Grimal
After attending the Conservatoire National Superieur de Musique in Paris under the guidance of Regis Pasquier, during which time he received advice and encouragement from renowned artists such as Schlomo Mintz and Isaac Stern, David Grimal studied for a year at the Ecole des Science Politiques in Paris before meeting Philippe Hirshhorn, who changed the course of his life.
David Grimal has an international career as a solo violinist, along which he has regularly given concerts in the last 20 years on the main classical music stages of the world and with prestigious orchestras such as the Orchestre de Paris, the Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France, the Orchestre de Paris, the Orchestre de Paris, the Orchestre de Paris, the Orchestre de Paris, the Orchestre de Paris, the Orchestre de Paris, the Chamber Orchestra, the Chamber Orchestra, the New York Symphony.

In addition to his career as a solo artist, David Grimal has also explored more personal projects.
The freedom offered by the collaboration with Les Dissonances allowed him to develop his inner universe by venturing into repertoires that are not accessible to solo artists.
Together with Les Dissonances, he founded L'Autre Saison, a series of concerts given for the benefit and together with the homeless at the church of Saint-Leu, located in the heart of Paris.
Since 2008, David Grimal has been Artist in Residence at the Dijon Opera.

He also holds many master classes and was a member of the jury of the Long-Thibaud International Competition in Paris in 2010.
He received the Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres distinction from the French Minister of Culture in 2008.
David Grimal sang on a Stradivarius, "ex Roederer" from 1710, but also on "Don Quixote", a violin designed for him by the French luthier Jacques Fustier.
David Grimal was present on Sunday at the George Enescu International Festival this year together with the Orchestra Les Dissonances, in the program being Debussy, Enescu and Beethoven.
Les Dissonances also took to the stage on Monday, this time with cellist Xavier Phillips in the foreground, and the program was composed of Schnittke, Enescu and Brahms.
Cinema City is looking for "Big Little Voices"
Cinema City launches the biggest challenge for children: dubbing two characters from the blockbuster "Snow Queen 3D"
Do you have a super-talented, spontaneous kid who likes movies?
Give him a chance to be a star.
In September, as part of the latest campaign dedicated to enthusiastic and ambitious children, eager to become future stars and who are between 8 and 16 years old, Cinema City is looking for "Little Big Voices", giving them the extraordinary opportunity to voice two characters from a famous animated film.
If in the classic drawings the emphasis was placed on the proximity of the voice of the actor to the specifics of the animated character, lately, when creating the story those who are going to interpret the voices are also taken into account, and they are usually very well-known actors.
Cinema City Romania, however, wants to discover new voices and that is why we are starting an unprecedented campaign.
We want to find the right voice and challenge parents to register their children for our contest.
They will have a special experience, because the characters are nice and the lines are funny.
"Children will have fun and have a real chance to be part of a team of actors," said Ioana Ionescu, Marketing Manager of Cinema City Romania.
In the first stage of the competition, between September 11 and September 30, Cinema City organizes a pre-selection from which 10 children (five girls and five boys) will be chosen who will have the opportunity to give a test in a recording studio with professionals.
All parents need to do is to access the platform petitilevocimari.cinema-city.ro, where to enroll the child in the contest and prepare him for the voice test.
Afterwards, they must choose one of the four films available on the platform, download the texts that the child is going to read and then, the child will register by performing their own version of dubbing.
Four films about friendship, fairytale heroes, magic and hope can choose the contestants to support the challenge: "Yellow Feather 3D", "Mune: Guardian of the Moon 3D", "Blinky Bill: Koala the naughty 3D" and "Maya Bee 3D".
Finally, the two most talented children (a girl and a boy) will see their dream come true and will voice a character from the blockbuster "The Snow Queen", which will premiere in Romania in November this year.
FedEx earnings are mixed, lower tax forecasts for 2016
FedEx reported disappointing results for the final quarter, as the delivery giant slashed its full-year profit estimates due to low demand for transportation services and rising costs for its ground transportation division.
The company also said it plans to hire around 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
During the same period last year, FedEx announced it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
The company’s shares fell about 2.5 percent in pre-market trading, 45 minutes before the opening bell sounded on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said it expects to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending May next year, down 20 cents, according to a previous estimate.
Analysts had expected the figure to be $10.84, according to a survey conducted by FactSet.
The lower estimate comes despite price increases of 4.9% on average, with entry into force on 4 January and higher surcharges for ground transport of large or heavy packages, which will apply from November.
The company said it still expects earnings growth from the previous year as a result of lower costs, higher revenues and the development of online commerce.
President and CEO Fred Smith said that “the company is facing a considerably weaker economic situation than expected, particularly in terms of global production and trade.”
The holiday hiring plans were announced a day after competitor UPS said it plans to hire 90,000-95,000 additional workers, about the same number of jobs it did last year.
In the quarter ended August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, up 6 percent from the previous year.
Earnings per share were $2.42, below the average estimate of $2.44 per share made by 12 analysts who responded to a survey conducted by Zacks Investment Research.
Profit increased 5% to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts who participated in Zacks’ survey estimated the amount at $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit in recent years by a decline in international priority shipments, which has led to stagnant revenue for its Express unit.
But the explosion in online shopping has boosted the results of the FedEx Ground division.
In the last quarter, revenues of the ground division increased by 29%, but operational revenues practically stagnated due to higher costs for large packages and own insurance.
The express unit saw an increase in revenue due to higher base rates, while the freight division’s revenue declined due to rising costs.
In pre-market trading, about an hour before the opening call, FedEx shares were down $3.85 or 2.5% to $150.15.
Tuesday’s closing was down 11% year-on-year and 17% from the record high recorded on June 11.
At the most anticipated meeting in years, policymakers at the Federal Reserve will spend two days this week around a 27-foot Honduran mahogany table to decide whether it’s time to raise a key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
Above them, at one end of the meeting room of the central bank, a mural of the United States will be seen.
The map is meant to remind you that Janet L. Yellen, President of the Fed, and her colleagues must put the nation’s economic interests above all else.
The central bank has been given a dual task by Congress: to maximize the U.S. employment rate and maintain price stability.
But since the great economic crisis, Fed leaders have confirmed that there is a third unwritten task: financial stability.
And this third task could be the X factor in a decision too difficult to anticipate, which will be announced on Tuesday, and which will determine whether the U.S. economy is ready to be freed from the unprecedented incentive offered by the near-zero short-term interest rate in force since the end of 2008.
Even if most data point to a strong growing economy, recent turmoil in global financial markets could scare off already cautious Fed officials from adding volatility by raising the benchmark rate on federal funds — even by as little as a quarter of a percentage point.
“Obviously, the labor market and inflation will be the first and main issues that they will follow,” said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
“But I think that if they were looking for an excuse not to raise the interest rate, the growing uncertainty in the global market is enough to give them arguments to wait,” she said.
There is no consensus on the decision the Fed will take, which in itself causes instability in the financial market.
About half of the economists recently polled by Bloomberg anticipated a rise in the interest rate this week.
But financial markets expect the Fed to delay, a key indicator showing that the probability of growth is only 30%.
This would indicate a decline in the stock market if the Fed raises the interest rate, unless policymakers soften the blow by promising that it would be a long time before the next rise.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The surge was triggered by expectations that Fed policymakers will keep interest rates steady this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
“It would be surprising if the Fed were to raise the interest rate right now,” Lonski said.
If Fed policymakers were to do so, “they should act in depth in their policies to avoid panic in financial markets.”
Other experts said a rise in the interest rate would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
Just a month ago, the Fed appeared to be on track to raise the rate by 0.25% this month, the first small step toward slowly tightening monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of the U.S. recovery.
Yellen said in spring and early summer that she expected an interest rate hike this year despite objections from liberals that more economic progress would be needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, labour market growth was solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 percent last month, the lowest in more than seven years and close to the level the Fed considers total employment.
Earnings showed signs of growth.
And while inflation continued to fall short of the central bank’s annual target, Fed policymakers said a key reason was the temporary effect of sharply falling oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher rates and needs them, given the strain on the labor market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But global financial markets began to go into a tailspin at the end of this month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 16% below the record high reached in May as investors feared a slowdown in the Chinese economy would drag down global growth.
The market has somewhat rebounded this month, with the Dow now about 10% below its May high.
For Fed policymakers, market turmoil adds to the complex calculation of the timing of interest rate hikes.
“Without what’s happened in financial markets and news of China’s weakening economy in recent weeks, it would be firmer at the meeting,” said Stephen D. Oliner, a senior fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Fed official.
Now, he predicts that they will wait at least a month to better manage the effects.
“There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the U.S. economy and they have almost no data to rely on after the events in China,” Oliner said.
The welfare of the global economy is not one of the Fed’s major interests, so it should practically not be taken into account in decision-making.
In reality, however, the Fed has become the world’s monetary authority.
In recent years, the influence of the central bank has been huge.
The mere allusion by then-President Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could “narrow” its monetary expansion triggered an earthquake in global markets.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly twinned, Fed officials are expected not only to monitor progress elsewhere, but also to consult with other central banks and experts to better interpret the world economy.
His decision-making is “more art than science,” said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy at welfare management firm Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., said this month that “Fed has a history of overreacting to changes in the financial market that appear unrelated to economic fundamentals.”
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Commission, a decision-making body that supported the interest rate hike, gave the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
A financial crisis that hit Asia prompted the Fed to cut the benchmark rate by 0.75% in three meetings, "despite the limited identifiable implications for U.S. development," Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials returned to those declines.
The Fed should put the issue of financial stability first only in the event of a major crisis, such as the 2008 market earthquake, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's interest rate committee.
The latest hectic period is nowhere near that level, he said.
“We certainly don’t want to be afraid of an interest rate hike because the markets are upset,” said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still has a double mandate and does not mention financial stability and, until something changes in this regard, I do not think it should take premature action.
Are you looking for a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown.
The market/warehouse opened/opened in 1997 belongs to LAX-C Inc.
Often referred to as Thai Costco, LAX-C is a wholesale Thai market that also sells to the public.
Yes, it's in Chinatown and not in Thai Town.
The market/warehouse is a universal type store offering an amazing range of fresh, frozen and dehydrated products, popular Thai and Asian snacks and kitchenware, furniture, religious and holiday decorations.
There is also a car park where you can buy some motor oil.
The store is huge and it takes at least an hour to walk through all the aisles.
If you’re hungry from all that shopping, eat at LAX-C BBQ Express.
The interior food district of the store (good, affordable) is close to the houses and offers several options of dishes that can be taken as a package.
What's in Stock: Do you need anything - anything- Thai?
You can probably find it at LAX-C.
The products are reasonably priced and some items are sold wholesale.
Fresh products include herbs, fruits and other Asian and Thai products.
The meat aisle is large, as is the fish aisle - the staff that serves will clean and fillet the fish and even fry it for you if you want.
An important part of the store is dedicated to the huge freezer district, where you will find frozen curry leaves, melon and ginger, whole ducks, fish, blood and beef ball, pork carcasses, fish meatballs, traditional sausages, semi-prepared and much more.
Who buys from there: Restaurant owners and chefs, as well as families and individuals.
Shopping carts and fork carts can be accommodated in the wide aisles.
Discovery: fresh Durian fruit right next to the house area.
Where it is: The store is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles, on the outskirts of Chinatown and Downtown - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own shared parking area with other shops and restaurants.
Although there are chances that the store will agglomerate, there is usually no hard parking space.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the polls, despite Channel Nine's attempts to broadcast on the Today Show about the change in party leadership.
The urgent move of Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to convey on the subject of the consequences of the changes from the leadership of the liberal party did not bring a significant increase in the audience for Today.
The morning broadcast of Channel Nine aired from the capital after Tony Abbott's defeat to Malcolm Turnbull.
The competing Sunrise show, moderated by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was picked up in London as part of a series of broadcasts over the course of a few weeks that included Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This "crucifixion" of distance did not seem to matter much to Aussie TV viewers, with Sunrise having an audience of 397,000 viewers in the five capital cities, compared to Today with 339,000.
Today saw a slight increase compared to Monday’s (317,000) and last Tuesday’s (283,000) audiences, but the numbers were lower than last Thursday’s (343,000).
Today has narrowed the gap to Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today had an average audience of 318,000 and Sunrise had an average audience of 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference varied between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far, in September, Sunrise has an average audience of 349,000 viewers and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that happened all morning.
This morning, it is not only Parliament that is affected by the current of change!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for the question!

The main news was the stunning debut of the 800 Words series starring former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama, about a recently widowed father who decides to move with his two children to the coast of New Zealand, had a very impressive average audience of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics wondered if Thomson was able to cope with a show on his own without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
The audience results for last night answered resoundingly “yes.”
The X Factor show aired by Seven remained in place, with 1,136 million viewers, slightly ahead of The Block (838.000) and TBL Families (726.000).
Seven recorded ups and downs on the second night it aired The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (5:00 p.m. to 5:30 p.m.) of Andrew O'Keefe's new general culture show averaged 446,000 viewers.
The second half of the hour (17:30 to 18:00) climbed to 623,000 viewers – enough for a small victory in front of Eddie McGuire’s show, Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half-hour of The Chase Australia had an average audience of 520,000 viewers and the second half recorded a whopping 720,000.
Hot Seat had an average audience of 620,000.
Chase Australia’s drop in ratings on the second night will give Nine tacit confidence that Hot Seat will finally triumph at 5:30pm.
The Chase Australia replaces Million Dollar Minute, a show that failed to beat McGuire's show.

Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the richest man in Russia, was arrested under threat of a gun at an airport in Siberia.
Because he openly challenged President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company, Yukos, was seized, and his pro-democracy efforts were curtailed.
Four people lost their lives after police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets into the crowd demonstrating against the country’s proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence occurred on Tuesday evening in Rupandehi district, about 280 km west of the capital Kathmandu.
According to Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the district police chief, more than 1,000 protesters gathered in front of a police station, and some of them threw rocks and Molotov cocktails.
Mr. Dhakal stated that the police used tear gas and then fired shots into the air before resorting to the use of rubber bullets.
According to him, twenty police officers and five civilians were wounded.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known to kill but are usually used as a less lethal alternative, caused so many deaths.
The clash was the latest in weeks of violent protests in Nepal's southern region, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say the newly established provinces under the new constitution would dilute their political influence.
Protests have also erupted in western Nepal, where the Tharus ethnic group wants its own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, were killed in violent clashes on August 10.
When four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - a major step towards a new constitution but a highly controversial issue in Nepal, a country governed centrally for hundreds of years.
The process of drafting a new constitution began in 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands in April.
This week in Kathmandu, lawmakers voted on the clauses in the draft constitution and officials said the new charter could be adopted on Sunday.
We won't use wire fences, dogs, cops and guns
The Prime Minister continues his exchange of views with the Hungarian authorities.
At the opening of Wednesday’s government meeting, Ponta reiterated Romania’s firm stance on the refugee crisis.
We make every effort to manage the refugee crisis, all institutions have a coordinated opinion.
Romania does not agree and will not apply anti-democratic measures, guard dogs, wire fences or police with weapons.
"It is a shame for 21st century Europe to apply methods from the 30s," said Victor Ponta.
"The prime minister also said that all the dates and details of the refugee crisis will be discussed and determined at the CSAT meeting on Thursday," the prime minister concluded.
NHC Announces 60% Cyclone Likelihood South of Cape Verde Islands
A broad low-pressure front about 560 km south of the southernmost point of the Cape Verde Islands has a 60 percent chance of turning into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure front roughly halfway between the Cape Verde Islands and Lesser Antilles also has a 60 percent chance of forming a tropical cyclone in the next two days, the Miami meteorologist added.
Weight reduction surgery may be helpful for diabetics with mild obesity
The benefits of weight reduction surgery for people with mild obesity with type 2 diabetes could last for at least five years, according to a new study.
It is still premature to say whether diabetics with mild obesity live longer after weight-loss surgery than those undergoing nonsurgical treatments.
“It takes a long time to centralize mortality data,” said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an obesity surgery specialist who wrote an article about the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss operations, also called bariatric surgery, use various methods to shrink the stomach.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the body’s ability to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has proven effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted on people with morbid obesity, with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a unit of weight in relation to height, is considered normal in the range 18.5-24.9.
A BMI of at least 25 indicates that a person is overweight and people with a BMI above 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI by going to: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers at Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected after 2007 in a trial comparing two types of bariatric surgery — gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy — in the medical treatment of type 2 diabetes in people with mild obesity.
The mean BMI in people who underwent surgery decreased from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in the study.
Meanwhile, BMI in people who received nonsurgical treatments for diabetes remained almost at the same level, namely 29.
Of those who underwent surgery, diabetes completely healed in 36% and partially in 28%.
In the medically treated group, by comparison, diabetes was completely cured in only 1% and partially in only 2% of subjects.
In addition, blood pressure control, triglycerides and “bad” LDL cholesterol “were generally better in the surgical group,” the authors concluded.
The researchers also monitored blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood glucose levels over time.
The researchers write that the optimal level of hemoglobin A1c is below 7%.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c level decreased from about 9% to about 6%.
But in the medically treated group, it remained at about 8%.
But this improved “glycemic control” — reflected by improved hemoglobin A1c levels — did not reduce the mortality rate to five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results associated with the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, compared with the sleeve gastrectomy group, the bypass surgery group lost more weight (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), experienced more significant decreases in BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%), and had a higher likelihood of complete remission (46%).
Although the new study does not indicate a benefit in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of high-weight people in Sweden that surgery prolongs life, says Blackstone, of the University of Arizona, School of Medicine – Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese people who underwent bariatric surgery were about 29 percent less likely to die after 15 years, compared with a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not indicate a survival benefit in patients who underwent surgery, Blackstone said it is an optimistic outlook for people with BMIs below 35 who are interested in the procedure.
“This is where this paper is critical because it states that this surgery is safe in the lower BMI group,” without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease, she says.
Blackstone added that patients and their doctors should start taking their weight seriously when the patient’s BMI reaches 27-30.
“I think we’re waiting too long to get people to take this seriously,” she said.
I think once they've accumulated these genetic changes that have short-circuited their bodies predisposing them to obesity and diabetes, it's extremely hard to get back to normal.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe could not accept all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader has issued a call to end violence in the mother countries of refugees.
The Dalai Lama spoke about the current refugee crisis in a speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama’s Centre for Compassion in Oxford, dedicated to ethics studies, at the start of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He said that, in the current situation, the interests of humanity should prevail over the interests of every nation and even every continent.
He also stressed that, although admirable, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is inadequate to the situation.
“It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe,” he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria to deal with the crisis, he stressed that it is only a temporary solution.
“It is wonderful to care for a few thousand refugees, but at the same time we need to think about long-term solutions to bring sincere peace and development, especially through education, to Muslim countries,” he said.
After all, we need to think about ways to reduce crime in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The force has never solved these problems," he added.
On the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush’s actions after the September 11 terrorist attacks, saying that the violent response from the US has generated a chain of uncontrollable events.
After the events of 9/11, I sent condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him to resolve this issue without resorting to violence.
I know his motives were strong, but he used force and generated unexpected consequences,” the Dalai Lama said.
Four-fold increase in the number of children who have ingested hand detergent in the last 4 years
According to the Georgia Anti-Poison Center, anti-poison centers in the U.S. have reported an increase of about 400% since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 who swallowed high-alcohol hand detergent.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Control Center, cases of ingesting hand detergent in children under the age of 12 reported at poison control centers rose from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
“Children have more frequent access to these products, and unfortunately, a percentage of them end up in the emergency room,” Lopez told CNN.
Lopez said some kids intentionally drink detergent and others do it to impress their friends or respond to challenges on social media.
On YouTube you can watch movies that show teenagers how to drink detergent to create cheap drinks.
It turns out that teenagers mixed the mouthwash detergent with alcohol to get a stronger drink.
Younger children may be attracted to the attractive smell of detergent.
“A child doesn’t think it hurts him,” Lopez says.
Many of the most attractive types (hand detergents) are scented.
Hand detergents with strawberry, grape, orange flavor are the most attractive for children.
Hand detergent contains about 45-95% alcohol.
Especially in young children, just a few sips can cause alcohol poisoning.
“It’s very concentrated alcohol,” Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Kansas University Hospital’s poison control center, told the Kansas City Fox 4 channel.
Thus, we avoid leaving a glass of whiskey on the table, but people leave these hand detergents in accessible places and if the little ones get to them, this is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently ingested the equivalent of four sprays of strawberry-flavored hand detergent at school, has arrived at the emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was 179, twice the threshold at which an adult is considered under the influence of alcohol by law, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room physician who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah was sulking and could not walk when he arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children’s hospital to identify signs of brain damage as the girl fell and hit her head because of alcohol, Ritchey said.
“It was scary,” Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah’s mother, told CNN.
It could have been fatal.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use alcohol-free products or wipes and to keep hand detergent out of the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some detergents have been associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing hand detergent containing an undeclared toxic ingredient.
The health authorities assumed that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not ethyl alcohol, specified as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth graders in upstate New York plotted to poison their “bad” teacher by “putting antibacterial products in the classroom,” according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to hand detergent and has banned it in her classroom.
The police considered the plan to be "insignificant" and referred the disciplinary issue to the school inspectorate.

There were rumours of misunderstandings at Celtic, which Griffiths dismantled, and Griffiths insisted that he and his team not be put under increased pressure as they prepare to face the Dutch league leaders.
I don’t think we feel the pressure, I think the players are just waiting.
Absence of Scots in title race bores Dutch - de Boer
The former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch international Ronald de Boer said Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic - because they are not fighting for the title with Rangers.
De Boer, currently Ajax ambassador, said: "In the Netherlands I no longer broadcast Celtic's match summary; why?"
Because there's Rangers out there.
It’s not just the return of the Rangers.
We are talking about the Old Firm.
We talk about both teams together and that’s where the interest goes.
The tension is high in Old Firm matches and it’s not just the Scots who want to see these matches.
I'll change the situation, Deila promises.
RONNY Deila has accepted that Celtic is fighting hard but the Norwegian boss has promised to change the situation.
The defeat with Malmo and the subsequent elimination from the Champions League was followed by the defeat against Aberdeen who played in 10 men, now in the top of the standings with a five-point lead.
But Deila said: “Celtic have had periods before and will recover.”
We want to get out of this situation as soon as possible.
I know it’s very frustrating and a lot of people are extremely angry or sad about what’s going on.
We feel the same way – but we have to move on.
We need the support of Celtic because that’s how the players get better.
It is extremely important that we remain united now.
Warburton’s prudence on January transfers
Despite comments just a few weeks ago suggesting he had identified a few targets for the January transfers, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is cautious when it comes to transfers, insisting he doesn’t want to affect the Ibrox team’s unity.
The former Brentford boss said: “The transfer period in January is very different from the one in the summer.”
In the case of players transferred in the summer, there is the period before the season in which they can be integrated, which you could observe this season in our group.
The team is doing very well.
Sometimes you do more harm if you bring in players who are not needed.
Celtic target Michu after retirement
Swansea striker Michu, who was associated with Celtic during the transfer window, has suggested he may retire upon the expiry of his contract with Swans.
The 29-year-old struggled with ankle problems for two years and was unable to leave Wales in the summer.
Hearts clash with SFA over Neilson's comments
The Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was eliminated and lost 3-2, but the quarterback's red card was then cancelled - the third red card cancelled in eight months.
Neilson maintains his statements, insisting, "I didn't question integrity, I didn't comment on performance."
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
The invincible Hibee was taken aback after admitting to singing a song with offensive lyrics about former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in March 2014 in a pub in Edinburgh's Roseburn region before a derby with Edinburgh at Tynecastle.
"It was derby and it was the excitement of the moment," the striker said, adding: "It goes without saying that I will not return to Tynecastle unless I play for Celtic."
Tannadice Board Trusts Dundee United Management - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly insists that the Dundee United board still has confidence that the management team will change the situation – but agrees that the decline on the ground must end.
I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We're going to get the boys back in shape," Donnelly said.
McInnes happy for 'dirty victory' against Hamilton
Derek McInnes acknowledges that the Aberdeen team must desperately hold on to the Hamilton Accies for their seventh successive league win, which brought them five points ahead of Celtic thanks to Adam Rooney's penalty kick in the first half.
McInnes said, "There's no team that has won anything, cup or league, that hasn't won games like that."
Unemployment in Scotland Remains Unchanged as UK Rises
The unemployment rate in Scotland remains unchanged at 164,000 in May-July, while the number of unemployed in the UK as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
The unemployment rate in Scotland was 5.9% higher than in the UK, at 5.5%, according to figures presented by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Meanwhile, the employment rate in Scotland has fallen by 12,000 over the three-month period, with the number currently employed at 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell in the quarter to 74.0% - a figure above the UK average of 73.5.
Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell, commenting on the latest figures, said: "The authorities' long-term plan has laid the foundations for a stronger economy."
It’s been almost a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have seen improvements in the Scottish labour market, with the employment rate rising and the unemployment rate falling.
Why I'm Witnessing an Execution in Oklahoma
In the course of today, except for a belated legal intervention, I will look at how a man is sentenced to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn’t, I’ll sit in a room for observers in the execution room of Oklahoma State Penitentiary and watch Richard Glossip get executed by administering the lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
The invitation first came in January through his best friend, and although I was shocked, I accepted.
As the day approaches, the idea horrifies me.
So, why should I do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole capital punishment story.
It would offer a unique perspective.
True, journalists can witness executions in America, and because the demands usually exceed the number of places available, a macabre lottery is held to decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of seats reserved for press representatives from 12 to five.
The elect will regard the execution with impartiality.
I can't do that.
I would sit next to Richard Glossip’s closest friends, plus I developed my own bond with him over months of phone conversations and a visit that lasted two and a half hours.
I like the guy.
We often laugh when we talk.
The prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist, so I will not be allowed to have a notebook and a pen with me to write down what I see.
I'll have to try to remember all the details.
An Oklahoma journalist accused me of compromising my impartiality on Twitter.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story as he wishes, get access.
I complained to her.
He admitted that he “could have formulated it better,” but he still thinks I’m wrong.
Richard Glossip disagreed with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn’t tell me what to write, and I wouldn’t do it if he asked me to.
I told him he could remove me from the witness list at any time.
But he wants an international report to be there to write about it.
He believes that if he dies, advertising will help the movement against capital punishment.
Kim Bellware, a reporter for the Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to know more about the case, listen to the series of multimedia files we made.
I will not go back here on all the details.
I can't say for certain that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese make him guilty of complicity.
But I think it's very likely that he wasn't guilty of murder.
I believe with certainty that there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
And I will watch him die from that perspective.
I can't pretend to be totally objective.
For this, you can read articles written by other reporters.
From me you'll find out what it's like to watch a man I like die needlessly.
Peter Moody Claims Stewards Tried to Spy on Him and Threatens to Withdraw from Racing
Peter Moody said that the stewards of Racing Victoria tried to infiltrate a spy at his stables last year and threatened to withdraw immediately from racing.
He launched an attack on the stewards and integrity department of Racing Victoria, claiming that they were running a personal campaign against him, the drop that filled the glass being Lady Tatai's removal from the race due to treatment administered on the day of the race.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for racing and that he is put in a difficult situation when it comes to the positive result on Lidari’s cobalt test, for which he has no explanation.
For 18 months he swallowed his words about statements about spies and did not want to resemble "the fox that does not reach the grapes".
“I wasn’t going to say anything about it, and I’ve been silent for a long time, but sometimes you get so frustrated that it all comes out all of a sudden,” Moody said.
It is known that it continued.
Sometimes you react and you have to bear the consequences, and I will have to live with what I said.
Tonight I will go home and sleep peacefully.
I want to go with my head up and I want the owners I work with to see that I am striving to offer them the best.
From the moment they start to think that this is not the case, I have to give up my job as a trainer.
At that point I'll have to think about what I'm going to do with my certification.
Earlier, Moody dropped the bomb in an interview with racing.com in which he said the integrity department tried to spy on his stables.
“Eighteen months ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart were sitting in a room next to a man – whose name I will tell if asked – and they offered to hire him to my stables to provide information about the activity there,” Moody told Racing.com.
He obviously considers me a cheater.
If so, then they should all resign because they were incompetent in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former president of RVL, David Moodie, current president of RVL, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of RVL, knew at the time and know today.
Am I supposed to think it's personal?
Is it necessary for RVL to start having a backbone and can hold people outside of the trainers accountable for what is happening in the industry?
Do I have a bad influence on the industry?
Is my influence on the industry that bad?
Maybe that's how others see it.
Maybe they need to take my license and set me aside, and I have no doubt that the statements I make now could lead them to think about this.
I’ve reached the point where I don’t care anymore and that makes me sad.
It makes me very sad.
I'll put pressure on them and get them to make a decision.
My family supports me and I can leave.
The trainer’s frustration grew with Lidari’s lengthy cobalt testing investigation, and the removal prompted him to state that he could “put his license on the table.”
Moody, whose name is most often associated with training the undefeated champion Black Caviar, labeled the race-day treatment rule as “ridiculous” after a poultice of mud or clay was applied to the horses’ legs, in violation of the rules.
They're breaking the rules of the race.
I have to take full responsibility for that,” he said.
One of my employees accidentally put mud on his leg.
It could have happened last night.
It could have happened yesterday, which it did.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody could be disqualified for three months for treatment on race day consisting of applying poultice, for which the stewards have opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
The people who make these rules know nothing about horses.
“We all understand that rules are needed, but it’s gone too far,” Moody said.
The driver who hit and ran from the scene of the accident in Cobram was arrested
Police arrested a man after a collision with a cyclist produced in Cobram at the end of the week and followed by the escape from the scene of the accident.
The bicyclist was taken by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital, seriously injured after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley highway on Saturday morning.
Police officials say the driver of the vehicle did not stop to help the injured bicyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man surrendered to Shepparton police.
He will be charged with absconding from the scene of the accident, refusing first aid and other road crimes.
The bicyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains hospitalized, in stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy responds to opponents on wrestling charges.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy called the criticism of the cladding tactics used by his team "distorted subjects" brought up by the NRL's top two favorites.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed Storm players to "pick up" their team in Storm's nervy win in Friday night's qualifying final in Sydney.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a slight reference to Storm after his team's win in Saturday night's North Queensland Cowboys qualifier when he called the match a "demonstration" of the rugby league and said the two Queensland teams were not very good at wrestling.
Bellamy jumped to the defense of the cladding tactics approached by his team and stated that the players were simply focusing on “contact” when placating.
Bellamy says he gained confidence after two top coaches criticized his team, meaning they were worried Storm would beat them.
“And it doesn’t stop there — I didn’t hear Trent Robinson complain about wrestling when they beat us 24-2,” Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven’t changed anything in our defensive systems or techniques all year, except that for the last six weeks we’ve really put the emphasis on contact in the tiles and so we’ve changed the situation.
Trent has been in this position for three years and obviously has a great team so he’s probably not used to losing and it was a shock for him.
Funny how it always happens at this time of year.
Bellamy contradicted Bennett's idea of "animating football", reminding his mentor St George-Illawarra of Bennett's winning of the championship in 2010 by playing "boring" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He made his case by comparing his Saturday night game to our Friday night game and talked about how exciting the game was,” Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 St. George got a lot of criticism for being a boring team and Wayne said he didn't care how black he was under the fingernails.
But now he has a team that can play what we would consider to be exciting football, especially thanks to the fast young midfielders.
This kind of game you want to do when you have players like that.
He brought up this argument in 2010, now he wants everyone to adopt his style of play - not every team has two midfielders like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to be able to play like that.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because they are somewhat worried about the match with us.
Six weeks ago they probably weren’t thinking about us when they were thinking about the big games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the match between Storm and the Roosters was a tougher score match compared to the Broncos' match against the Cowboys.
The Broncos match was probably a good match, we haven't seen it yet, what was the score? 16-12?
Our match ended 20-18, in our game there were two more attempts, does that mean exciting game?
Or is it exciting to take breaks and not score?
For me they are plans.
If they talk about us, it means that at some point we might meet them.
Storm is free this weekend as they have won the right to play at home with either the North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks in next Saturday’s prelim finals at AAMI Park, with tickets going on sale starting next Tuesday morning.
Stevan Hogg used the girls’ phones to trick paedophiles into sending pictures
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to ask for pictures of abused children.
Stevan Hogg took the girl’s phone while she was sleeping and then logged into an online messaging service where another user sent her a series of indecent images with children as the subject.
The girl later woke up and noticed the missing phone, which she found in Hogg's hand while he was asleep.
He looked into his phone and found the disturbing messages and immediately alerted his mother.
Upon arrival, police saw the five photos then analyzed computers found at the address and found “worrying” Internet searches using terms to find indecent images of child subjects.
Hogg claimed he did it to “attract pedophiles” on the Internet before “pretending to be a cop to scare them.”
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told the court in Dundee: “He said it’s an addiction – that he’s addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that he did the computer searches but said that he did it because he wanted to pose as a policeman to scare pedophiles.
He was asked about the conversations he had with the unknown person who sent him the images and about the fact that he asked that person to send him other pictures.
He said he did it to lure her in.
He said he doesn’t think clearly when he drinks and wants to see images of rape and murder.
Mr Robertson added: “When the little girl found the messages on her phone, she called out to her mother and was shaking and crying.
The girl saw the indecent images on the phone and the accused was confronted.
The girl was interviewed and told that the accused used his computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Last year, on 14 June, the 23-year-old Hogg, who lives in Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to making or taking indecent pictures of child subjects, and breached the conditions of his parole on 25 January this year and did not appear in court for trial on 24 March this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim has asked that Hogg not be recorded in the sex offender registry because it can be said that this offense “did not involve a significant sexual aspect.”
Judge Alistair Carmichael postponed the sentence until October, on the grounds of social reports.
Hogg was released on bail in this case but remained in custody prior to appearances for other cases.
He was put on the sex offenders' register before his sentence was handed down.
Robert Mugabe, President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, delivered the wrong speech in Parliament
At the beginning of the year, Mr Mugabe, the oldest African leader, fell on the steps of a podium.
He was not injured, but the footage of the fall went viral on social media.
The opening of the parliamentary session was also disrupted by opposition representatives who said they had received anonymous death threats, threatening otherwise to boo Mr Mugabe during his speech.
Last month they booed him during his speech in Parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The head of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) parliamentary group, Innocent Gonese, said seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones, warning them not to disrupt Mr Mugabe's speech.
“The message was sent by a hidden number but it’s called ‘death,’” he told reporters after Mr Mugabe’s speech.
It warns the MPs concerned that immunity applies only in Parliament and once they leave Parliament, parliamentary immunity no longer has any value.
The head of the parliamentary group said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, was "concerned" about threats to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to make 30,000 redundancies
Hewlett-Packard is expected to make between 25,000 and 30,000 redundancies as part of the company’s efforts to restructure and reduce costs in the service sector.
This year, HP will be split on the stock exchange into two companies, separating the computer and printer division from its rapidly growing corporate hardware and services operations.
The planned layoffs will bring costs of about $2.7 billion starting in the fourth quarter, HP said.
“These restructurings will bring the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise a more cost-competitive and sustainable structure,” said Meg Whitman, president and CEO of HP, which will lead the unit after the breakup.
“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP today and will have a broad portfolio of businesses that will help businesses transition to the new way of doing business,” Whitman said.
Operating as a separate company, we are better positioned than ever to meet the growing demands of our global customers.
According to a statement from the company, Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have annual revenues of more than $50 billion and “will focus on delivering unrivalled integrated solutions” to companies.
It splits a company founded in 1930 by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, with the purpose of producing electrical equipment and whose garage in Palo Alto was called the "Silicon Valley swing".
HP has gone through a massive reorganization to accommodate the shift from traditional computers to mobile devices.
The move by HP, the world’s second-largest computer maker and one of the largest technology companies in the U.S., is the latest in the field, based on the idea that companies that focus their attention better in one direction perform better.
FriendsFest: the comedy series that taught us important lessons about friendship between men
The absence of similar characters in the series is evident, given that the need for men to open up is now more desperate than ever, with suicide rates among young men reaching a 15-year high.
In 2013, suicide was the leading cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the UK, and remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an attempt to address the issue, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) designated 2015 as the Year of the Man, seeking to challenge the culture that prevents men from asking for help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the struggle to succeed in this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students who had symptoms of depression concluded that if the patient is surrounded by enough friends “with a healthy mood,” his chances of recovery double.
To the same extent, for people who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the likelihood of mental disorders occurring.
Of course, for friendship to take effect, it must first be accessible.
In this age of communication dominated by social networks, where the emphasis is on style rather than substance, the immediate nature of the response often takes precedence over contact with meaning.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to create the appearance of a strong personality, open to fun and success, even if in reality it is isolation that dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the cost of intrinsic values – our inner desire for personal development and friendship – that affect our mental health even more deeply.
The billionaire inventor of a video game recently explained that money doesn’t really buy happiness.
The beauty of Friends was that it focused attention on this idea.
The characters were not defined by their job but by their own personality, which they showed by interacting as friends.
The humor of Joey and Chandler’s frequent hugs, the moments when they look at football in the comfortable armchairs, and Ross’s passion for Rachel came from the fact that it is known that men can associate with this situation, even if they often shy away from fully exploring their feelings.
As one social worker explained to me: “My role in listening to suicidal and depressed people showed how even the smallest interactions with friends can make a difference.”
Often, people who turn to us do not feel able to talk to friends.
The old saying to do it yourself is strong, as is the feeling of being perceived as a weak person if you talk openly about problems.
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer more psychological coping mechanisms in the long run.
The series highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
No matter how much objective, outside intervention through the phone helps people in moments of desperation, long-term support comes from family and close friends.
So, if you’re attending this weekend’s FriendsFest hosted by Comedy Central, with full movie sets to celebrate the event, why not invite your friends over for a coffee in Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship will make.
Friends airs Comedy Central from start to finish – all 236 episodes – on #FriendsFest
Di Maria scores and helps PSG sideline Malmo
Angel Di Maria celebrates alongside Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored on Tuesday in his debut Champions League match and helped PSG to a win over Sweden's Malmo.
Below we present the chronicle of the match and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani did their duty, with Paris Saint-Germain starting the Champions League group stage with a reassuring 2-0 victory against Malmo in Tuesday's match at Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored in less than four minutes from the start of his debut Champions League match for PSG, giving the champions of France an advantage although they missed a number of occasions before securing their advantage with Cavani's goal in the 61st minute.
Arriving in Group A alongside Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions because the goal of the French team is not only to qualify for the knockout stages but also to improve their path to the quarterfinals in each of the last three tournaments.
However, although they took the points, Laurent Blanc's students were far from a perfect picture, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic who wasted the opportunity of the goal after which he was replaced by the team from his hometown and the club where he started his brilliant career in 1999.
“It’s not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League, so a 2-0 win creates problems for our opponents and establishes a comfortable difference from the next place, even if there are aspects that we still need to perfect throughout the season,” Blanc said.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we did, although I’m sorry we didn’t manage to score another goal or two.
Ibrahimovic returned from injury to one of the three changes to the Paris team, with a 2-2 draw at home to Bordeaux in the Ligue 1 over the weekend, but Di Maria took the spotlight in the fourth minute.
Last month when he was transferred from Manchester United, the Argentine offensive midfielder was named the man who will take PSG to the next level in Europe and proved it when he lunged at Marco Verratti’s pass behind Malmo’s defence before kicking incredibly over Johan Wiland in the long corner to the right of the goal.
But if anyone expected PSG to win by snapping their fingers, they were disappointed.
Malmo, who beat Celtic in the play-offs to reach this stage and entered the field with nine starters to national teams, with a five-man defense and two defensive midfielders, was a strong opponent.
But their attack was not impressive, with the exception of Nikola Djurdjic who passed Kevin Trapp in the 34th minute.
Instead, the PSG players slowed down several times, giving a few unnecessary passes and not finishing the interventions, even Ibrahimovic who missed no less than five attempts in the first half only and was then replaced by Cavani right after the restart of the game.
Ibrahimovic, however, proved much more skilled in supporting his colleagues, his pass being the one that Di Maria sent in a deflected shot by Wiland over the gate in the 52nd minute.
The second goal was scored in the final after an hour of the match, thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan who scored the sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic passed Maxwell's cross.
This goal eliminated Malmo's hope of rebalancing the score, and just a superb Wiland stop from a distance to fend off David Luiz maintained the final score before new entrant Ezequiel Lavezzi was called off with a goal in overtime.
The Norwegian coach of the Malmo team, Age Hareide, later stated that PSG were with a class over and that "The last match we played in the Champions League was last December."
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which does not rise to the same level.
Qualifications are not enough.
Hats off to PSG.
They played an excellent game.
Glencore raises $2.5 billion in stock sales
Swiss mining giant Glencore, hit by falling stock prices on the commodities exchange, has raised $2.5 billion from the sale of shares as part of a sweeping plan to massively reduce debt.
London-listed Glencore said it had sold new shares worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion to pay off the debt.
After losing 57% of its market value this year, the company is bracing for plummeting prices on the stock market as China’s dwindling economic activity weighs on demand and wreaks havoc in markets.
The preferred underwriting right increased the price of Glencore shares on the London Stock Exchange in trading on Wednesday morning.
Shares rose 2.77% to 131.60 shillings on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69% higher.
Glencore has disclosed the sale of $2.5 billion worth of shares as part of broader plans to cover nearly a third of its $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new shares at 125 shillings per share, down 2.4 percent from Tuesday's closing price.
It took 1.3 billion shares out of the company, representing 9.99% of the group.
Worrying about the growth of China’s long-stagnant economy has led to a substantial rise in iron ore prices, by about half, and coal, copper and other commodities have fallen by 20-40%.
Xi urges broader expansion of global economy
On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping told a reform group that the economy must open wider to the outside world to fuel growth.
"China must commit to attracting foreign investment and expertise and improving opening-up policies," Xi said at the 16th meeting of the Central Leading Group for Deepening Overall Reform.
Promoting openness and encouraging reforms will bring new impetus and vitality and make room for economic growth, Xi said.
The management group adopted a number of guidelines, including a negative list of market access regulations, relaxing customs control policies, encouraging state-owned enterprises to absorb private capital and reorganising the resident registration system.
According to the statement, a negative list will be drawn up that will identify sectors and areas of activity where investments are not allowed.
The system will be gradually tested and improved through test programs.
According to the statement, the measure is important because it will give the market a greater role in allocating resources, ensuring a law-based business environment and providing wider market opening.
State authorities will also loosen controls on the powers they delegate to companies, making sure those companies decide how to run their businesses.
According to the statement, China will also allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
In an attempt to open up state-controlled sectors, several sectors will be open to private investment.
“The state authorities will not change their policy on foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of companies established from foreign investments and provide them with better services,” the statement said.
In addition, it will be easier for foreign citizens to apply for permanent residence permits or so-called “green cards”, optimizing the requirements and streamlining the application process.
The meeting also discussed the guarantee of the right of lawyers to practice and the education of judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was also attended by Premier Li Keqiang and leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement made after the meeting.
The education unions, dissatisfied with the Government's proposal to increase wages by 10%
The negotiations between Prime Minister Victor Ponta and the leaders of the Education unions have not reached any result, the Government proposing a 10% salary increase, from December 1, with the payment on January 1, 2016, and the unions wanted a 15% increase, from November, or a 20% increase, from December.
The talks took place at Victoria Palace on Tuesday evening, with the prime minister accompanied by Education Minister Sorin Cimpeanu, Finance Minister Eugen Teodorovici and Labour Minister Rovana Plumb.
The Government’s proposal today did not satisfy us, otherwise we would not have been able to summon the leaders of our federations.
The 10 percent we were promised today is less than what we expected.
“In fact, these 10 percent is the money that we have stipulated in our agreement with the Government last year for 2016,” said Anton Hadar, president of Alma Mater, at the end of the talks.
In the future, health and education will be the areas in which we will invest all the money we have.
According to him, on Thursday, there will be a meeting of the FSLI in which the representatives of the Government will also attend to present to the representatives of the confederations in the country the proposal for salary increase, and the trade unionists will decide whether to accept the offer of the Executive.
The Prime Minister also told the trade unionists that the Government is trying to send the Wage Law as quickly as possible to the Parliament, so that it can enter into force on 1 December.
The normative act provides for the increase of salaries in the educational system with 25% of the total increase of 70%, an increase foreseen in the document to be made staggered, in the next four years.
Also, Victor Ponta promised to the trade unionists the acquittal of all court sentences in 2016.
Migrant Crisis: Tragedy in the Aegean Sea
At least 22 migrants drowned in Turkey's territorial waters on Tuesday after the boat they were on capsized.
The victims included 11 women and five children, according to Yahoo News.
The boat was in the Aegean Sea and headed for the Greek island of Kos.
Turkey's coast guard said it had rescued 249 people from the wreck, but their nationalities were not known.
Earlier on Monday, two other people died while trying to cross the Aegean Sea.
Also over the weekend, 34 migrants, including four babies and 11 children, drowned off the Greek island of Farmakonisi, 15 kilometres off the Turkish coast.
The situation was similar: the boat was carrying more people than it could handle, so it was shipwrecked.
The route has become popular lately for immigrants who want to escape war and hard life in countries like Syria or Iraq.
Over 100 flight attendants fired for being too fat
Air India is laying off around 130 stewardesses and stewardesses because they are overweight, the airline said late last week.
The state-run company said the decision was made for security reasons and recent government regulations, but critics said the move was “ridiculous” and “shockingly sexist.”
The mass layoff is the latest in a ten-year battle between the company and its more bloated flight attendants.
The weight limit for them dates back to the 1980s, when Air India started using charts with ideal weight and height.
In 2006, Air India fired nine female stewardesses who were considered "exceptionally overweight", as this "may have an effect on reflexes and impede the agility required to carry out emergency measures".
The stewardesses sued the company, won, and were rehired, but the company fired them again in 2009.
"All efforts to get them to lose weight have failed," a company spokesman said.
A football player from Steaua gives lessons to Gigi Becali: What decision he made
A footballer from Steaua gives lessons to Gigi Becali regarding the promotion of young players.
If the champion's funder decided to close the football academy in which he had invested a considerable amount, defender Paul Papp opened a football school.
The "Paul Papp" Academy will operate in the city of Dej, the deserts of the locality being expected to a first selection action.
I am extremely happy that I have reached this stage, to start the Football Academy that bears my name.
For me, it is extremely important to find talented children who can play football without having to worry about materials during training.
They have to take care of one thing: to play football as well as possible.
The technical details don’t have to be your concern.
They have to put their talent to good use.
This is what the Paul Papp Football Academy wants to do.
“I am also waiting for Mayor Costan Morar at the first selection of the children, to show them that he is with them,” Papp told dejeanul.ro.
At the Star Defender Academy, children up to the age of 11 are expected.
The whole party wants to govern.
Acting PSD President Liviu Dragnea said on Tuesday that the whole party wants to remain in government, and if the Prime Minister wants, this decision will be formalized at the PSD Congress.
I understand that Mr. Ponta expects this decision from the PSD Congress, everyone wants the government, the whole party.
If we want to formalize it by a decision of the Congress, we will do the same.
There won't be any emotion about it.
"There were no elements, voices in the party, opinions in the party that would give someone the uncertainty of the government or give someone the impression that someone from the party does not want the PSD to remain in government, in the current government, with the current prime minister," Dragnea said at the end of the meeting of the PSD's Permanent National Bureau.
PSD has announced when it will hold a congress - what will be decided then
Prime Minister Victor Ponta said on Tuesday that it is important that, at the PSD Congress, beyond the election of the leadership, a clear message is given if the government is to continue or if the party decides to go into opposition.
Dragnea: I will announce on Monday if I will run for a position at the Congress
On the other hand, Liviu Dragnea will announce next Monday if he will run for a leadership position at the future Congress.
I will be singing, Monday, after the Executive Committee, if the date of the congress is set.
"I will announce if I will run for a position in the leadership of the party," Dragnea said at the end of Tuesday's meeting of the PSD's Permanent National Bureau.
Asked if the hesitation about announcing the candidacy is related to his file, Dragnea said he does not have this problem.
I do not have the issue you are referring to, but it seems fair and honest to all my colleagues in the party to announce or not a candidacy at the moment when the date of Congress is formally established.
"It's the only motivation," Dragnea said.
The vast majority of the Social Democratic branches proposed the extraordinary PSD Congress on October 11, and the exact date of the Congress will be decided on Monday by the party’s Executive Committee.

An Italian was caught at the Bors customs with migrants hidden in the TIR
Two Sri Lankan nationals were spotted at Bors customs on Monday as they tried to cross the border illegally, hiding in the semi-trailer of a freight car driven by an Italian citizen.
Following the investigations, it was established that the two had paid the driver 4,000 euros to be transported to France, informs the Border Police.
At the specific control, the border policemen observed, in the cabin of the truck, a large travel bag, in which there were personal belongings for several people, which is why they carried out a detailed control over the means of transport.
On this occasion, the border policemen discovered, hidden in the trailer of the freight forwarder, among the plastic crates, two male people.
The checks showed that the people in question, two men, aged 28, are Sri Lankan citizens and asylum seekers in Romania.
"In the course of the research, the young people said they intended to arrive in France, which is why they contacted a countryman, through whom they met the Italian driver, who offered to transport them to their destination, where they were going to receive 2,000 euros per person," the Border Police said in a statement.
The two migrants were prepared "criminal work in terms of committing the crime of attempting to fraudulently cross the state border".
Also, Pompeo B., the 45-year-old Italian national who was driving a Renault Magnum-branded car registered in Romania, carrying plastic crates for an Italian company, was detained for 24 hours, to be presented to the Bihor Court with a proposal for preventive arrest.
How satisfied are Romanians as a couple: Men versus women
Most Americans are happy with their relationships.
This is the conclusion of a study carried out on the occasion of the arrival in Romania of John Gray, the famous author of the bestseller "Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus".
A total of 62% of respondents say they are “very satisfied” and “satisfied” with the overall quality of their relationship.
“However, 18% show themselves to be ‘slightly unsatisfied’ and ‘very unsatisfied’ in the couple’s relationship, and another 18% declare themselves to be ‘appropriate,’” the study concluded, according to a statement released Tuesday by Ziare.com.
The situation is slightly different when the responses of men and women are analyzed separately.
Thus, 28% of men are very satisfied, 39% satisfied, 17% suitable, 6% very unsatisfied and 8% slightly unsatisfied.
In terms of women, 33% said they were satisfied, 24% very satisfied, 8% very unsatisfied, 14% slightly unsatisfied and 19% chose the right category.
When we look at the degree of satisfaction (positive), we will notice that men are more satisfied.
As far as the neutral state is concerned (right), we see a difference of two percent.
"Similarly in the very unsatisfied situation, the biggest difference being the slightly unsatisfied response where we see a 6 percent difference," the statement said.
The study also showed that a quarter of Romanians (26%) spend one hour or even less time together, 18% spend between five and eight hours together, and 45% between two and four hours.
The authors of the study also say that "Romanians feel the need for a little more adventure in their lives (24%), followed by affection (21%), money (21%), safety (20%), new (19%), sex (19%), respect 18%, confidence 17%, pleasure 17%, connection 17%, knowledge 16%, protection 14%, importance 14%, learning 12%, freedom 11%, self-knowledge 10%".
The study was conducted by Extreme Training between June 1 and September 1 on 1,369 people, with a calculated margin of error of 2.6%.
Europe is once again ashamed.
German Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel said on Tuesday that Europe was "shameful" after Monday's failure of the ministerial meeting in Brussels on the distribution of refugees within the European Union.
“Last night, Europe was once again embarrassed,” Sigmar Gabriel, who is also economy minister in Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government, told a news conference.
Earlier, German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere suggested cutting European Union structural funds for countries that reject refugee quotas.
European interior ministers, meeting in Brussels on Monday, failed to reach an agreement on the mandatory distribution of 120,000 refugees, requested last week by the European Commission to deal with one of the worst migration crises in Europe since 1945.
He was mayor for half an hour.
The interim mayor of the Tuzla commune in Constanta county only enjoyed half an hour of this function, because of the DNA prosecutors.

He said that this church of Brancoveanu is a great blessing.
He told me: "Brother Emil, think that here were Brancoveanu, Eminescu, Mihai Viteazul, who led the hand of Saint Nicholas".
"'You know what a blessing this country is,' Vadim used to say to me," said the parish priest.
Corneliu Vadim Tudor is to be buried on Thursday, at the Ghencea Civil cemetery, with military honors.

What happened to coach Darren Cahill?
Simona Halep is facing a crucial decision for her career, being forced to choose whether or not to continue to collaborate with coach Darren Cahill.
The two have worked this year in the Adidas Player Development program, the Australian technician being with the romance only at major tournaments.
Simona had only words of praise for Cahill, who seems to be the only coach who has managed to impose himself in front of the capricious athlete.
The Adidas program will end at the end of this year, however, and Halep must decide whether to offer a consistent contract to Cahill or if he will give up the collaboration.
We still don't know exactly what's going to happen.
We talk and see.
“After Singapore, I will be able to give an answer,” Simona told a news conference.
Darren Cahill is one of the most expensive coaches in tennis today, demanding a contract worth about $1 million a year.
In addition, the Australian is also a sports commentator, a job he would not want to give up at the moment.
The last race Simona and Cahill will work on together is the Singapore Champions Tournament.
It wasn't normal, I wasn't respected
Victor Piturca revealed how he parted ways with the Romanian national team last autumn.
The former selectioner confessed that he did not get along with the FRF president, Razvan Burleanu, after he took the place of Mircea Sandu, and thus made the decision to leave the country.
Finally, he proposed to the head of the Federation to substantially increase his salary to stay, but he was refused.
I’m not sorry I left the country.
Then I'm sorry, I'm leaving a job behind.
So I thought it was good for me and I think it was good for me.
What happened to me when I was a coach wasn’t normal, I wasn’t respected, I wasn’t respected for my work.
I worked well with those before the Federation, but when Burleanu came to the Federation he came with a preconceived idea, he did not know me, he found out different opinions in the press about me.
It didn’t change me because it was very difficult at the time, with the results we had, plus it was the financial situation in the middle.
We continued the work, everything went very well and he probably changed his ideas too.
But I wanted to leave.
If they wanted me to stay, I offered them a contract extension.
We have around 400 and some thousands of euros a year, I was going to have around 600 thousand euros.
I did not talk to Burleanu, but with his right hand.
"He agreed, but only if we finish first in the group," Victor Piturca told Dolce Sport.
Victor Piturca resigned from the Romanian national team last autumn, although the team had good results in the Euro 2016 preliminaries.
The technician accepted the proposal to train in Saudi Arabia, he immediately taking over the Al Ittihad group.
Armored and water cannons at the border
Hungarian police deployed Humvee military vehicles equipped with machine guns on the border with Serbia after violent clashes on Wednesday, when water cannons and tear gas were used against migrants wishing to enter from Serbia, despite Hungary erecting a barbed wire fence.
At least 20 police officers and two children were injured in the clashes, reports Russia Today.
So far 20 police officers have been injured and the ambulance service has taken over two children who were injured after being thrown over the security fence.
"We will restore the fence and strengthen it and protect Hungary's security by any means," Gyorgy Bakondi, the prime minister's security adviser, said.
Police tried to control with water cannons and tear gas the crowd of people throwing plastic bottles, stones and pieces of pavement.
The authorities reported that dozens of migrants broke the fence at the crossing between the cities of Roszke and Horgos and managed to enter the country.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto called on Serbia to take action against "very aggressive" migrants from the common border.
There are reports that the Serbs have supplemented their forces at the border.
Following Wednesday's incidents, Budapest suspended the crossing at the Roszke-Horgos border for 30 days.
Hungary is in a concerted action to close its borders to stem the flow of migrants.
If on Tuesday he announced that besides the barbed wire fence at the border with Serbia he would also raise one at the border with Romania, to the vehement protests of Bucharest on Wednesday, the Hungarian Prime Minister announced the raising of a fence at the border with Croatia.
Rare disease of which a man suffers
American Nick Hess was suspected by his family of being an alcoholic, his wife even filming him when he was dizzy, he could barely stand on his feet and his words were hard to understand.
Although the 35-year-old said he did not drink alcohol, he was clearly intoxicated.
When she first accused me of being drunk, without drinking, I thought she was crazy.
"But friends and family thought, 'Maybe he's drinking alone, he's a secret alcoholic,'" he said.
When he saw his wife’s footage with him, the man from Columbus, Ohio, just didn’t recognize himself: “I was looking into my eyes and I wasn’t there.”
“It was horrible, I couldn’t remember anything.”
In addition, his wife, who, though she doubted him for a while, eventually went with him to countless doctors, remembers that Nick’s breath also smelled of alcohol.
The moment that made Nick think the most was when, after a minor accident, when he was hit by another car, it was discovered that he had an alcohol level three times higher than the legal limit, although the night before he had consumed only one beer.
After years and countless investigations, it was discovered that Nick suffers from an extremely rare disease, "Auto-brewery syndrome".
Basically, the body causes all the carbohydrates consumed to ferment, turning into alcohol.
The one who suspected that this might be Nick's illness was actually his wife.
The disease doesn’t have a cure yet, but since giving up carbs, Nick hasn’t had such episodes.
Destroyed a Mercedes with a golf club
A South Korean man destroyed his Mercedes S63 car in protest of his dealer’s services.
The man “attacked” his car with a golf club, causing enough damage for the car to be taken out of use, BT reports.
The whole scene was filmed, and the clip went on the Internet, to the amusement of those who watched it.
The man claimed that the car has malfunctions that endanger his life and that of his family.
His anger arose when the dealer from whom he bought the car did not solve his problem, as he had agreed.
The government approved on Wednesday the "National Strategy on Immigration for 2015-2018" and the "Action Plan for the current year", documents considered to be "another stage Romania is going through in the efforts to modernize the immigration management process on the national territory", according to a press release.
The strategy aims to effectively manage the phenomenon of immigration, including general strategic objectives, specific objectives and directions of action that reflect the policies established at European level, adapted to national realities.
In view of the problems faced by the states in the immediate vicinity of Romania, measures are envisaged for the unitary and coherent management of the situations determined by the possible appearance of an influx of illegal immigrants on the territory of Romania, generated by situations of crisis of a political, social, economic or military nature.
“The Romanian authorities will contribute to the creation of a flexible admission system, but at the same time, they will pay special attention to citizens from states with migration potential or that may harm national security,” the source added.
The strategy identifies a number of factors that can influence immigration and asylum, including maintaining the conflict situation in Syria, reviving the conflict in Iraq, maintaining an unstable situation in the areas bordering Romania (Ukraine, Transnistria), perpetuating and intensifying the Israeli-Palestinian armed conflict.
On the other hand, the document also sets some general strategic objectives related to immigration, such as: promoting legal migration, more rigorous controls on the legality of the residence of third-country nationals on the territory of Romania and the appropriate application of removal measures and restrictive measures, improving the national asylum system.
The national strategy shall also include specific objectives relevant for the transposition and implementation of the general strategic objectives.
These include: facilitating access to the territory of Romania for third-party citizens who respond to employment needs, facilitating access for third-country nationals to higher education institutions in Romania for the areas and professions identified as deficient.
Regarding the 2015 Action Plan, the Government considers that it is "a means by which concrete activities are established that lead to the creation of a flexible system to stop the growing migration phenomenon".
Romania, in a European top regarding the labor market
Latvia, Romania and Bulgaria recorded the largest increase in total labour costs among EU Member States in the second quarter of the year compared to the same period in 2014, according to data published on Wednesday by the European Statistical Office (Eurostat).
The index refers to employers’ staff expenses.
Thus, between April and June 2015, the total labour cost rose by 1.9% in the European Union and by 1.6% in the euro area.
Romania, third in the EU in terms of labour cost increase
The highest increases were reported in Latvia (7.9%), Romania (7.7%), Bulgaria (6.8%), Estonia (5.5%) and Lithuania (4.3%).
The only EU countries where hourly labour costs fell in the second quarter of this year were Greece (minus 2.9%), Cyprus (minus 1.2%) and Italy (minus 0.4%).
The increase in labor costs in Romania between April and June 2015 is mainly due to the increase in the hourly cost of labor in industry and services, with 7.9% and 7.6%, respectively.
In the construction sector, Romania registered an advance of 5.8% of the hourly labor cost.
The activity report of the TVR management, rejected in the committees: Stelian Tanase risks dismissal
Parliament’s culture committees rejected on Wednesday the activity report of the Board of Directors of the Romanian Television Society for 2014.
Seventeen MPs voted against the report, one against (Senator Varujan Vosganian) and one abstained.
The text of the report will be forwarded to the Joint Standing Bureaux.
They'll decide, probably next week.
The next plenary session will be discussed.
"I think that given this situation it will be done relatively quickly," said the chairman of the Senate Culture Committee, Georgica Severin.
He added that "it was common sense" for the TVR leadership to be present at this meeting, given that no representative of the TVR leadership was present at the meeting of the Culture Committees.
It was common sense for the TVR leadership to be present because no one here was subject to personal attacks or anything like that.
The invitation was made to CA members since last night, with an approximate hour that we did not know the time, but today, after the meeting of the Joint Bureaus, I personally sent a fax to the TVR management inviting her.
I believe that the moment you are summoned, you being a budget employee, paid from public taxes and you are summoned to a meeting of the joint committees even if you do not like living.
"Because it is your duty to serve, you are in an institution subordinate to Parliament," Severin said after the meeting of the Parliament's joint culture committees.
He added that during the meeting the financial aspects of the institution were discussed on the basis of the negative opinion of the Budget Committees.
The debts we also saw how they continued, it came up with the idea that this year would be up to date, but they were not paid from the historical ones.
"I remind you that it is not my fault or anyone else's in these committees that the agreement with the banks and the tax authorities has been lost, these are clear management problems," Severin said.
He added that after the activity report will be rejected by the assembled plenum, elections will follow for a new Board of Directors, which will elect the director general of the institution.
I don’t know who will be nominated for this position.
Miracles won't happen.
It is important to take political decisions to make this institution work.
I am not the man to lie to you, to tell you that a genius will appear who will stand in line here and fight.
I hope that those who decide, the plenum of Parliament, by their vote to choose with much reason the people who will lead TVR.
There must be people who know what is happening there, have experience and have a lot of fairness and respect for the institution and tradition.
I do not know who he will be, if you ask me what qualities he must have - good sense in the attitude towards employees because it is a maze of petitions that come from employees, complaints, dismissals.
“When you get such notifications 50, 60, 70, something is rotten and we are talking about the financial situation that is a disaster,” concluded the chairman of the Senate Culture Committee.
Although he did not present himself to the Parliament, the president-director general of TVR, Stelian Tanase, sent a letter to the president of the Chamber of Deputies, Valeriu Zgonea, in which he requested that the Parliament consider a series of measures that could lead to saving and guaranteeing the economic and political independence of public television, among them the indexation of the TV tax.
In the letter, Stelian Tanase requests, in addition to the indexation of the TV fee, the amendment and completion of GD 978/2003 regarding the fee for the public television service, in order to update the provisions at the level of up-to-date technological changes, as well as to regulate the procedure regarding the control in the field of payment of the TV fee and the finding of contraventions and the application of sanctions and penalties.
He also wants to issue a provision providing for the extension of the obligation for all electricity suppliers to become agents of SRTv for the collection of the TV fee, by involving ANRE in the regulation of this activity.
In his opinion, it is necessary to establish a maximum ceiling of 5% of the commission from receipts.
Stelian Tanase asks for the reduction of the VAT rate for the specific activities of the public television station and the contribution for the CNC from 15% to the level of 3%, but also the amendment of Law 41/1994, in the sense of the possibility of receiving budgetary / financing allocations for the purchase of licenses for major cultural and sports events - World Football Championship, Golden Stag, Eurovision.
He argues that SRTv will become incapacitated in the coming months considering that the labor law obliges the employer to execute court decisions, even if they are not definitive, and the wage rights are honored with priority over any other obligation.
The TVR administration has constantly made efforts to reduce expenditures on TV staff and production.
“Thus, travel and other cost-generating activities were reduced, a series of commercial contracts were renegotiated, and at the end of July TVR News was closed,” the letter from TVR’s president said.
Tanase believes that the disastrous financial situation cannot be remedied by his own efforts alone.
“Without the support of the state institutions – Government, Parliament, Presidency – Romanian Television will sooner or later be unable to fulfill its public mission,” the letter states.
The leadership of the Chamber of Deputies decided to send the letter to the Culture Committee.
The son-in-law of Vasile Blaga, sent to court
Vasile Blaga’s son-in-law, Ionut Andrei Rudeanu, was sent to court on Wednesday by prosecutors from the Prosecutor’s Office near the Bucharest Court of Appeal.
He is accused of tax evasion, in a file with damage of about 600,000 euros, being under judicial control.
Andrei Rudeanu was arrested on May 22.
He founded the security firm Axis Corporate Security SRL, together with his mother, in April 2009, a year after he married Vasile Blaga’s daughter Agathe.
The investigations revealed that, in order to avoid the payment of taxes to the state budget, the representatives of a company specialized in the provision of security services would have created an criminal circuit, consisting of several commercial companies, through which fictitious transactions would have been highlighted.
“In fact, the company’s accounting would have recorded fictitious purchases of services, which, in reality, were not provided, the state budget being thus damaged by about 600,000 euros,” the Romanian Police explained in a press release.
The Sheiks set the fate of Sanmartean
The Sheikhs of the Al-Ittihad club have determined the fate of the middle Lucian Sanmartean.
Although the Arab press announces that the separation of Sanmartean from Ittihad is imminent, the manager of the coach Ladislau Boloni, Arcadie Zaporojanu, says that this will not happen again.
Boloni is very pleased with Sanmartean.
Lucian plays the match starter and does it well.
The Sheiks also realized that he was the best and that it would be wrong to give him up.
There would have been another option to bring another player, much better, but nothing came of it.
"There were several talks, like the one with Mbark Boussoufa, but nothing came to fruition," Zaporojanu told Digi Sport.
Lucian Sanmartean arrived at Al-Ittihad earlier this year.
Ilie Sarbu was voted vice-president at the Court of Accounts
The Parliament plenary voted on Wednesday to appoint PSD Senator Ilie Sarbu, the father-in-law of Prime Minister Victor Ponta, as vice-president of the Audit Authority of the Court of Accounts.
According to Mediafax, 290 votes were recorded "for" and 108 "against".
The vote was secret, with ballots.
The PNL representatives were the only ones who voted against this proposal, informs Digi24.
Moreover, the liberals criticized Sarbu’s appointment to this position and announced that they would contest it at the CCR, as he has a file at the DNA, but does not have the necessary training and experience.
Ilie Sarbu has 30 days, according to the law, to resign from the Senate, because the new position at the Court of Accounts does not allow him to do politics anymore.
The PSD senator will take the position of vice-president of the Audit Authority at the Court of Accounts, which remained free after Ioan Anton was revoked, following a decision of the Constitutional Court in September 2014, which found that he was appointed unconstitutional.
Surprise from one of the sexiest actors: I grew up in the kitchen
As Bradley Cooper is set to play a chef in the movie “Burnt,” the actor made a revelation his fans didn’t expect.
In a recent interview, he said he grew up more in the kitchen: “I worked most of my life as a cook.”
He revealed that he had been working in the kitchen since he was 15 years old, working for a Greek restaurant, and then, in college, he continued on the same path.
The actor explained that his mother has Italian origins, so his entire childhood cooked with his Italian grandmother.
When asked what his future plans were at the time, Bradley Cooper said he was never the kind of man to make plans for five years, "not even two."
“It’s not at all motivating for me to have a map,” he said.
“I have dreams, things you would laugh at if I told you,” he said, but said that what he wanted from childhood was fulfilled.
At the age of 40, the actor admitted that he sees himself in the near future director, taking the model of Clint Eastwood, who began directing at this age.
Ponta, accused of uncontrolled slanders and irrational claims
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto on Wednesday strongly condemned Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta's claims that the political decision-makers in Hungary are "nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which refugees flee."
"Yesterday, Victor Ponta lost his self-control and, through his irrational statements, offends the whole of Hungary," the Hungarian foreign minister said in a statement.
Civilised European politicians do not speak of such unchecked slander.
"His remarks have only one explanation: he has lost his full support in domestic politics in Romania," the Hungarian foreign minister added.
In a Facebook post on Tuesday evening, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said he wanted to draw attention and sanction the behavior of senior Hungarian government officials, who, in his opinion, "are a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union."
I do not wish to respond to the challenges posed by some Hungarian government representatives.
“These are a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union; and in anti-Semitic attitudes, and in the treatment of minorities of all kinds, and now during the refugee crisis!”
The Romanian prime minister added that he is a supporter of rational and sustainable solutions to the refugee crisis, saying that aggressive brutality and laws will not solve the problem.
Barbed wire, aggressive laws, prisons and brutality will certainly not solve the problem - they will only show that in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, there are political decision-makers with nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which the refugees flee!
"I believe in solidarity, in rational and sustainable solutions and especially in the superiority of European values - what we see in recent days in Hungary is in total contradiction with these objectives and values!"
Earlier on Tuesday, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto called Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta's remarks on Hungary's handling of the refugee crisis "simple lies," saying they were inappropriate for a 21st-century leader.
The Hungarian foreign minister also said on Tuesday that the Romanian prime minister's "extremist and lying remarks" related to the internal political crisis in Romania and said Budapest was waiting for an apology from the Romanian side.
Szijjarto referred to a statement made on Monday by Prime Minister Victor Ponta.
What I have said and always say is that I am against xenophobic discourses, the idea of closing the borders, that everyone who comes here is a terrorist, that it is nonsense from the Middle Ages, and I am totally opposed to this approach.
If we can get more, we will get it, the problem is our logistical ability to treat those people like people, not how our Hungarian neighbors treat them, with batting and inserting.
"I don't agree with that," the head of the Romanian executive said at a press conference in Targu-Jiu.
Also on Tuesday, Peter Szijjarto announced that the government in Budapest has decided to begin on-the-ground preparations for the extension of the fence it is building on the border with Romania, to deal with a possible change in the route used by migrants.
Later, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said that Hungary's decision to erect a border fence does not solve anything about the refugee problem and "takes Hungary out of Europe".
What is the connection between Osama bin Laden and the collapse of the crane in Mecca?
Saudi authorities said the Binladin Group, owned by Osama bin Laden's family, was "partially responsible" for the collapse of a crane on Friday at the Grand Mosque in Mecca, in which 107 people died.
According to a commission of inquiry, the company "did not comply with safety rules", the Saudi Press Agency (SPA) reported.
The company’s directors have been banned from leaving the country until the investigation into the case is completed.
The company will also be excluded from new public contracts.
The construction firm is owned by the family of former al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden.
The company was founded by Osama bin Laden’s father 80 years ago and is now run by the former terrorist leader’s brother, Bakr.
Binladen Group has been working for 4 years on the expansion of the Great Mosque, in order to accommodate more pilgrims.
The accident occurred on Friday evening during a storm, when a crane, probably unbalanced by strong winds, collapsed on the eastern side of the roof of the Grand Mosque in Mecca.
As a result of the accident, 107 people died and nearly 400 were injured.
How he shut the mouths of the contestants
Considered by many the greatest Romanian footballer in history, Gica Hagi was labeled, after retiring from activity, as a weak coach, who may not be able to achieve performance in the new posture.
After unfortunate experiences at the national team, Steaua or Galatasaray, Hagi took over, a year ago, the role of coach at Viitorul Constanta, the team he patronizes.
Exactly one year after taking over the team, the King has demonstrated that he is able to turn a struggling team to save them from relegation into a top team.
Thus, after a year, the Future recorded, with Hagi coach, 16 victories, 11 draws and 11 defeats.
The balance sheet is one of a top team, fighting in the European cups.
Things took an even better turn for Viitorul this season, as the team finished second in Liga 1, with 19 points, one less than leader Astra Giurgiu.
The future also has the best attack in League 1, with 20 goals (equal to Astra), more than twice as many as Steaua.
On the other hand, even though he brought more experienced players to the team, Hagi continued the policy of promoting young players, and lately names such as Ianis Hagi or Hodorogea have appeared in the starting team.
The club's policy has made Viitorul a team to watch for foreign teams, so Hagi sold this summer of 1.5 million euros - Ianis Hagi (Fiorentina - 1 million euros) and Alexandru Mitrita (Bari - 500 thousand euros).
Together with Steaua, Viitorul is the only profitable team in Liga 1, according to data from the Trade Register.
In the refugee crisis, Romania has so far played as a small country.
It’s a legitimate strategy, but after that you can’t ask to be treated as the seventh country of the EU.
Large countries are coming up with solutions for the whole EU, says Cristian Ghinea, member of the steering college of the Romanian Center for European Policies.
In an interview with Ziare.com, Cristian Ghinea showed that Europe cannot be turned into a fortress, and purely police means will not work in this crisis: "Perhaps we have doubts about the quality of the values with which these people come."
But there are masses that have started and we cannot turn back history.
Migration is a reality to which we must adapt as well as possible and adapt them to us.
According to Cristian Ghinea, we are in an extremely emotional moment, when politicians feel the need to show their muscles.
After he passes, Europeans will not be willing to give up free movement, but the rules in the Schengen area must be changed: "Schengen is now like an animal created in another era and that was not adapted to the situation now".
Where are we in the refugee crisis after this JHA council that, in fact, solved nothing?
It is clear that the EC president in agreement with Donald Tusk did not want to force a vote in the council.
All the predictions said he would have the necessary votes.
Before the Treaty of Lisbon, the principle of unanimity applied in the JHA and any state could block any decision.
That is why things have been very little integrated in the area of justice and home affairs.
After Lisbon, the normal procedure applies, in which the EC has the initiative, and the council approves it with the vote of 55% of the states, i.e. 16, representing 65% of the EU population.
The calculations said that the votes existed.
But they didn't want to go ahead.
Because it is a sensitive issue, there have been reactions of rejection even in Germany against Chancellor Merkel's opening policy and they did not want that in many countries to appear as a reaction of the type "EU sends us migrants on the head".
They have therefore postponed, but the problem remains because, obviously, this wave is creating a huge problem for Schengen governance and we are likely to see big changes there in the coming period.
So the mandatory quotas were not really eliminated, but the subject was just left to cool off?
Yes, on the other hand, there is talk of a greater involvement of the Frontex agency in the management of the external borders, which means a shift from the individual responsibility of the members who are at the external border of Schengen to the responsibility of the Community agencies.
Greece’s border with Turkey is also Germany’s border with Turkey, de facto, and this wave of migrants has given the limits of the old Schengen system.
Perhaps the Dublin principle will be abandoned, according to which migrants are the responsibility of the state where they first enter, because it is not sustainable.
If Greece topples, you can’t say indefinitely that it’s Greece’s business.
The problem is common.
Precisely because the problem is common, is a solution possible without a precise mechanism, perhaps even mandatory, of sharing the effort of reception?
No one knows exactly how mandatory quotas will work if they are reached.
Because there remains a problem: what do you do with a man who does not want to come to Romania or Portugal, but to Sweden or Germany?
I don’t think the European countries are going to take the migrants by storm: you are going to country X or country Y.
There will probably be some single filtering centres in Greece or Turkey where asylum applications can be processed.
They are working on solutions like this.
But the problem does not have a simple solution.
There are countries that have decades of experience in trying to integrate migrants, they are countries without any experience, like Romania, where the problem of migrants will increase the xenophobic current.
The truth is that we are talking about millions of people who are in Turkey, in Lebanon, in Jordan, who are in precarious camps and who have just begun to leave for Europe.
One estimate says that only 10% have left, winter is hard to cross the Mediterranean, but we expect a wave maybe even bigger next year.
What do we do with these people?
My prognosis is that we will get used to this problem, we will not look at it so catastrophic from a media point of view.
You were talking about countries with less or more experience.
Do you think there is a place where large groups from a non-European culture have really managed to integrate?
I look at the Maghrebians in France, the Turks in Germany, they are still enclaved.
I wouldn't go for radical statements.
Of course, their integration is more difficult than in other waves of migration, but that does not mean that they do not integrate at all.
It has remained an unintegrated part that creates major social problems in France, in Germany, in the United Kingdom.
But purely police means won't work.
To create a fortress of Europe is illusory.
We need to look at the mechanisms of integration in European societies.
There were some mistakes here.
We need to be more pretentious.
Let’s ask these people to learn the language, to try to take over the values, to not be left with one foot in Europe and with one in their country of origin, bringing the rest of their family including through marriages of convenience.
But we must separate the impending problem of these people from the long-term problem of their integration.
If others have failed in long-term integration, it doesn’t mean we have to look at them drowning in the Mediterranean.
Perhaps we have doubts about the quality of the values with which these people come.
And if there’s going to be an intervention in Syria, which I don’t think, it doesn’t mean that the country is going to be rebuilt overnight and you can take them back.
Until solutions emerge, we see fortresses within Europe.
Borders have been closed, walls have been erected, border controls have been reintroduced into the Schengen area.
Is the European project in danger?
The European project as such, no, the Schengen area as it was built, yes.
It was built fairly minimally and arranging the rules so that the pressure was too great on the countries where these migrants first set foot.
I mean, we're free to roam around, but everyone's got their own problems.
In the face of such a wave it is not possible, because some countries do not cope.
When there are such waves of emotion, politicians want to show that they are doing something, but in the long run nothing much changes.
After the attacks in France, we do not have much more draconian anti-terrorism legislation in the EU than we had last year.
It's a wave of public emotion that goes both ways.
And it’s so unstable from week to week that you can’t make decisions based on it.
We have a lot of talk, a lot of warmongering from politicians at home under pressure to be manly.
And then you have the dramatic case of the drowned child in Turkey and the public opinion gets emotional.
After the public emotion passes, we will return to the reasons why we created this space, this freedom of movement that is not only for people, but also for goods.
This is the European Single Market.
And I do not believe that Europeans will give up this principle of freedom of movement.
That there will be other rules is something else.
Schengen is now like an animal created in another era and that was not adapted for the situation now.
How has Romania played in this crisis so far?
Like a small country that thinks that if it pulls the cap over its eyes and plugs up its ears, the theme disappears.
Faced with the reality of the waves of migrants, you can choose to be part of the solution or to say that it is not your problem as a small country.
That's what we did, it's a legitimate strategy, but then you can't ask to be treated as the seventh country of the EU.
You're not, you're not playing at the big country level.
Big countries come up with solutions for the whole EU, good or bad, we are not discussing their quality now.
Just like Poland did.
On the other hand, the effect of this crisis is that the Romanians’ appetite for Schengen will decrease a lot.
President Iohannis says it is perhaps good that we have not yet entered.
So we move from desperation of entry to a more pragmatic position, but the goal remains.
There is of course a risk if Romania and Bulgaria enter Schengen for migrants to see us as an alternative route.
This does not mean that there is a reason not to enter Schengen anymore, but to be more pragmatic.
Romania will be part of Schengen, and Schengen will exist, but transformed in the sense that external borders will become a common responsibility, there will be single rules of acceptance of migrants, single rules of deportation for those who do not receive asylum, single rules for countries considered safe.
The Ukrainian president said that after Russia shifted its attention to Syria in Ukraine, no one died.
Is there a connection between the two outbreaks, a game of Russia?
Russia has a frustrated power behavior.
She believes that to be a great power is to confuse Americans and Europeans.
From this point of view, yes, there is a connection.
Without the military and financial effort of the Putin regime, the Assad regime would probably have collapsed long ago.
And it was good to collapse before its main opponent was the Islamic State.
About two years ago there was a fight between the Assad regime and moderate secular and Muslim militias, supported by the Gulf countries and the West.
Then the Islamic State rose and now we don’t know if we want the Assad regime to fall.
Russia has been able to complicate matters, but it cannot participate in the solution.
It creates foci of instability and chaos that it cannot close.
But you are powerful only if you have solutions.
Off-side play is just a time-saving strategy.
Putin is probably waiting for offers to be made, for him to press the buttons to resolve the situation.
The offers do not come because the world is not convinced that he can solve in one way or another issues created by him.
But I disagree with the theories that these people are being driven by an invisible hand.
Let's not see Putin any stronger than he is.
What button will appear soon
Millions of Facebook users have gotten used to the "Like" button, and now the representatives of the social network are preparing another opposite, that of "Dislike".
On Tuesday, Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and CEO of the company, announced on his account that this button will be available soon, the New York Times informs on the blog.
Zuckerberg said the “Dislike” button would look more like a shade of what a user feels than a simple option.
However, his announcement raised the issue that Facebook could become a less friendly place.
Zuckerberg mentioned that he wants to avoid the moments when someone posts on his account an important life event, and someone else will give "Dislike".
Users of the network, which has reached 1.5 billion active accounts, have long asked for the opportunity to express their negative emotions or empathy with something sad.
Zuckerberg said it was not comfortable for people to “like” current events, such as the refugee crisis or the death of a family member.
"You may not be comfortable liking that post," the Facebook representative said.
The version of a new button on Facebook was not well received by everyone.
“There’s already enough hate on Facebook and social media,” Atiq Haneef of Afghanistan said on the New York Times Facebook page, where the article was posted.
"I'm going to give 'Dislike' to the 'Dislike' button," he said.
Roger Anderson, a microbiologist in Atlanta, has argued that there is nothing wrong with this button, encouraging people to have different opinions on Facebook.
Debra Aho Williamson, a social media analyst at eMarketer, said it was hard to imagine that a single button could convey a complex range of negative emotions.
Moreover, she argues, the election campaign is approaching in America, and the "Dislike" button would create a total disaster.
Only 70 refugees entered Hungary in 24 hours
Hungary on Tuesday accepted just 70 migrants, a handful of thousands who flocked to its southern border with Serbia, government adviser Gyorgy Bakondi said.
Hungary declared a state of emergency during the day in two counties along the border with Serbia due to the flow of refugees, closing a main border crossing point and announcing that it will build a fence at its border with Romania.
The move drew a sharp reaction from Serbia.
Just yesterday they said they would seal the border for those who want to cross, but not for those who want to apply for asylum.
"As you can see, this is totally different," Serbian Minister for Refugees Aleksandar Vulin said.
Ahead of the introduction of new immigration legislation, a record 5,809 migrants entered Hungary on Sunday, police said.
More than 170,000 migrants from the Middle East and Africa entered Hungary from Serbia in 2015.
Many avoid being registered and try to reach the West, especially in Germany.
The "new" county seat is about to fall.
Two Builders in Insolvency
The massive investments made here in recent years, with a view to moving the institution, are falling apart because they have been stopped several times.
Two major builders who worked here went into insolvency during the works.
The headquarters of the County Council in Vasile Alecsandri Street will end up falling apart on its own.
A year and a half after the consolidation and refunctionalization of the building was due to be completed, the works did not even reach half.
A final stage in the epic of the building was consummated last days, when the National Council for Dispute Resolution (CNSC) rejected a complaint from the company that wanted to take over the contract for the realization of the technical project for the works that are still to be executed.
The initial project was prepared by Impex Romcatel SA.
After the insolvency of the builder and the interruption of the works, the negotiation procedures were started without the publication of a participation notice with Impex Romcatel, the company will update the technical project, and then a new tender for the works will be organized.
"The negotiations were not concluded by a contract, however, as the CJ considered that the proposed form would have disadvantaged the institution," said R<0xC4><0x83>zvan Timofciuc, public relations representative at the CJ.
The CJ decision to interrupt direct negotiations was challenged in court by Impex Romcatel.
The Iasi court sent the complaint to the CNSC, which rejected it as late.
This does not mean, however, that CJ can start looking for another designer.
Impex Romcatel has the possibility to appeal the CNSC decision to the Court of Appeal, only after a final sentence of it being able to consider finding another designer.
Construction work on the building could resume as early as next year.
Our intention is to resume work as soon as possible.
In principle, the restoration of the technical project should not take long, but we need to reach the conclusion of a contract.
"We are waiting to see if the CNSC's decision will be attacked or not," Timofciuc said.
Work to consolidate the former police headquarters began in 2011.
A first works contract was terminated in April 2012, after works of 4.5 million lei had been carried out.
The tender was resumed, the contract being awarded by Moldoconstruct SA.
However, the company went into insolvency, and this contract was terminated, after payments of 1.5 million lei had been made.
So far, about 50% of the work has been done.
Initially, the works of consolidation, refunctionalization and attic of the building had been valued at 7.7 million lei.
"I say everything!" - the statement that could incriminate the former head of the Cadastre
One of the employees involved in the scandalous case from the Cadastre Office signed an agreement on the recognition of the facts, against deferred imprisonment.
Most likely, his statements will incriminate the other defendants, led by the former boss, Narciza Nedelcu
An adviser from the Office of Cadastre and Real Estate Advertising (OCPI) Ia<0xC8><0x99>i accused by the DNA in a corruption case has admitted fap tele.
The agreement on the recognition of the facts signed by Dumitru Dasc<0xC4><0x83>lu was registered yesterday at the Iasi Court, the judges deciding to give a solution in this case on September 29.
Dumitru Daniel Dasc<0xC4><0x83>lu was accused of intellectual forgery in continuous form and agreed to execute two years of detention with delay, as well as work for the benefit of the community.
As for the facts imputed to Dasc<0xC4><0x83>lu, the prosecutors pointed out that he, as an advisor to the Cadastre Office, together with other colleagues, "falsely drew up several acceptance minutes, taking into account the contracts for the provision of services previously performed by O.C.P.I. Ia<0xC8><0x99>i and the administrators of the companies SC.
The past days, the former head of the Office, Narciza Nedelcu, but also other former or current employees of the OCPI were sent to court in this case, the accusations being the settlement of some services to the mentioned companies, although the works were not carried out.
The pre trial exceeds 300,000 lei.
Adventures in the Stone Age
In the opinion of FRH President Alexandru Dedu, Romania can host a major handball competition only in 2024, and the preparation of the women’s national handball team for qualification to the Olympic Games costs a fortune.
The president of the Romanian Handball Federation, Alexandru Dedu, said yesterday, during a meeting with the press, that it is a great pride that our country has three teams in the Champions League groups.
As for Romania's women's national handball team, "the main objective is to qualify for the Rio Olympics, but for this they must pass two stages of caudine forks, first the World Championship and second the pre-qualifying tournament," Dedu said.
We want to qualify for the Olympics.
These are fantastic requirements from the technical staff led by Tomas Ryde.
A staff that will consist of seven or eight people.
He wants assistant coach, doctor, two masseurs, goalkeeper coach, physical trainer, head of delegation.
They asked us for some things to qualify, more specifically materials for physical training, that we have never heard of.
These are all to get to the Olympics, and I will do everything in my power to have them.
We are talking about a massive investment, there is a lot, a lot of money.
But this is the way to perform.
Because at the moment we are in the stone age with the preparation.
“The teams we’re fighting with have these materials and they’ve had them for some time,” said Dedu, who said he’s trying to get the sums needed to purchase these products from MTS and COSR.
The FRH president also referred to the infrastructure in Romania and the possibility that our country will host a major handball competition.
We don't have a gym in Bucharest.
It is an infrastructure issue and it is shameful to call into question a European gymnastics championship.
Let us not forget that in other parts of the world, entire Olympic districts were built within two years.
Before 1992, in the current Olympic area of Barcelona there was a garbage dump, and now it has become a landmark of beauty.
The same happened in London, where the organisation of the 2012 Olympics was also a success in terms of investment.
“In my view, in 2024 we can host a major competition,” Dedu said.
He added that international handball bodies are willing to grant Romania the organization of a major competition.
For me it is a priority to bring major handball competitions to Romania.
Mr. Ga<0xC8><0x9B>u went civilized with a project, people gave their agreement in principle, but they quickly clarified that the hall will never be built.
And I had discussions with the EHF, I told them that we want, that we are able to organize and they said that they agree and invite them to the first match in the new hall in Bucharest and then we talk concretely.
"So we have all the openness, both at the EHF and at the IHF, but we don't have the infrastructure," the FRH official explained.
The former great handball player avoided evaluating the chances of the women's teams CSM Bucharest and HCM Baia Mare to reach the Final Four: "I have asked all coaches to be reserved in the predictions, that if they do not meet they turn against them".
Good road to the World Cup
Romanian rugby players make their debut on September 23 against France
The captain of the national rugby team, Mihai Macovei, said on Tuesday in a press conference that all the members of the Romanian squad are ready for the matches of the World Cup in England, where they hope to obtain two victories: "We are ready".
Both I and my colleagues are running the engines at full speed.
We trained to give the best performance in the four matches.
Everyone will have high expectations, because our goal is to win in two matches, against Canada and Italy.
All groups are hard and ours is the same.
Let’s take it easy, first with France and then we’ll see.
“If we win against Canada, the match against Italy will be our final.
I cannot describe in words the joy of participating in the World Cup, it is the crowning moment of so many years of work.
I do not want to disappoint anyone in the rugby family and to come home with good results.
“We want you to be proud that some players, a small family like rugby in Romania, proudly represent the tricolor,” Macovei said.
The coach of the Romanian national team, Lynn Howells, who had his first experience as a coach at the World Cup, hopes to make Romanians proud of the rugby team: "It is a great honor for us to participate in this World Cup".
I am sure the players are ready to participate in the tournament.
It's an extraordinary experience for me.
For me it is very important that at every match I make the Romanians proud of the national team.
The president of the Romanian Rugby Federation, Haralambie Dumitra<0xC8><0x99>, is confident that Romanian players can confirm the progress made in recent years in rugby.
We have a very difficult group and we want to confirm the progress made in the national team.
I wish the athletes success and I am convinced that we will be at the height of the event.
“These boys started playing in Romania’s teams at 18-19 years old, so there is cohesion, there is a band of friends, who set out to achieve a dream,” Dumitras said.
At the Rugby World Cup in England, Romania will play in Group D, with the following matches scheduled: with France, on September 23 in London; with Ireland, on September 27 in London; with Canada, on October 6 in Leicester; with Italy, on October 11 in Exeter.
The competition starts on Friday at London’s Twickenham Stadium with the England vs Fiji Group A match.
New Japanese culture courses organized at the "Al.I. Cuza" University
About the arrangement of flowers in a vase, painting in a vase, but also a leisurely study of the beautiful arts specific to the Land of the Rising Sun you can learn at the courses organized by the students from Iasi.
The Japanese Culture Students Circle in Ia<0xC8><0x99>i organizes new Japanese culture courses (ikebana, sumie and fine arts) between October 2015 and June 2016, courses for both beginners and qualified people.
They will take place at the Center for European Studies of the "Al. I. Cuza" University of Ia<0xC5><0x9F>i and are organized to promote Japanese traditional and modern arts and culture.
For them there is a single participation fee of 50 lei per month per person.
In addition to art lessons, participants will be able to take part in exhibitions and other cultural activities to promote beauty.
The Japanese culture courses I have proposed were conceived as an invitation, addressed to the general public, to take the first steps on the road to self-knowledge through art.
"Interested people will be able to learn how to realize harmonious floral sculptural creations (ikebana), how to capture the soul of the surrounding elements in plastic compositions using the Japanese art of tuxedo painting (Sumie) or how to express their own individuality and creativity through the plurivalent universe of beautiful arts (graphics, drawing, painting) "
The courses are aimed at all those who are passionate about art, regardless of age or experience.
Registrations take place until September 30, and those who wish to request more information can do so at the phone number: 0742.027.153 or at the e-mail address: studenticultura<0x40>gmail.com.
14 million lei given to the "St. Spiridon" Hospital in Ia<0xC8><0x99>i at the budget rectification
What will be purchased with this large amount of money?
The hospital "St. Spiridon" received from the Ministry of Health, following the budgetary rectification, about 14 million lei.
The money that the medical unit received to use them by the end of the year will be invested in modernization and arrangement of some clinics, but also in medical equipment and technique for which the hospital has already started the public procurement procedure.
Thus, the health unit will be equipped with a new tomograph computer, with a new radiology device, with six kits used for surgical interventions, six ATI beds equipped accordingly, ophthalmic microscope and other devices necessary for the medical act.
On the other hand, 5 million lei of the money received by the hospital will be directed to the construction and arrangement works of the "Great Burning".
From the money from the budget rectification, UPU will receive 500,000 lei for the completion of the modernization works in the main section.
"In addition, in the coming days we will receive the works from the gateway that connects UPU with the cardiology, hepatology and gastroenterology clinics to ensure the transport in decent conditions of the patient from the UPU to the neighboring clinics," explained the manager of the medical unit.
The hospital will soon also have the Dermatology Clinic in T<0xC4><0x83>t<0xC4><0x83>ra<0xC8><0x99>i, which it will organize on an outpatient basis, in the same form in which it currently operates.
The clinic will operate in the area where allergology, hematology and endocrinology are located in the outpatient clinic and will have about 30 beds.
Ia<0xC8><0x99>ul, laughed by the RATP controllers and a flyer.
The Footsteps of a Tourist
A family of tourists from Cluj came to Iasi to visit him, but the trip ended with a bitter promise.
After the experience, neither my wife nor I ever want to walk in your city again.
Inadvertently, they were struck by the erroneous information in the leaflets, by the insensitivity of the RAPT controllers and, bonus, by a fine "as the law says".
The spouses arrived in Iasi a few days ago, stayed in a hotel in the Centre and asked for tourist leaflets.
They also received a leaflet in which the RATP routes were passed.
Armed with these maps, the spouses visited Ia<0xC5><0x9F>i.
But two days ago, when they were in Copou, they wanted to get to Palas Mall.
Since there was no ton of tickets at the station near Copou Park, they relied on the information printed on the flyer: that they could take the ticket by SMS.
No one has told them that this service no longer exists.
Confident in the flyer, they boarded a bus and tried to text after the instructions on the flyer.
Unfortunately for them, a team of RATP controllers appeared.
They said that there was no service for 2 years and that it was announced in the press that it was canceled.
How do I know what was written in the local press, me coming the night before I visit the city?
I talked to the controllers, I explained the situation, they said they didn't care, it's none of their business.
The attitude was very defiant.
They said all they could do was give us one fine instead of two (my wife and I).
“I paid, I did not want to ruin my day by visiting the gendarmerie stand and giving statements there!”, Ovidiu recounts.
In conclusion, the family was fined because of the erroneous information on the leaflet and the controllers who "applied the law to blood".
It’s not fair, and I made a referral to RATP Iasi to get my money back.
It's not about the money, I'm not over the top, but the point is, I felt cheated.
Bad luck for the rapists in Vaslui.
They had an accident and remained in pre-trial detention.
The trial of the seven rapists from Vaslui has moved, since yesterday, to the Ia<0xC8><0x99>i Court of Appeal.
The Ia<0xC8><0x99>i magistrates judged the first trial term in a non-public session in which the seven young people accused of mocking an 18-year-old girl asked to be released.
Before the actual start of the trial, one of the Iasi judges to whom the case had been assigned, Viorel Munteanu, made a request for abstention, which was admitted by his colleagues at the court.
The magistrate worked until the summer of this year at the Vaslui Court, where he was the president of the Pe nale Section, being the one who, on April 9, admitted an appeal filed by four of the defendants, ordering their arrest at home.
Currently, the case is judged by a panel that includes magistrates Maricica Mititelu and Geta Sandu.
Earlier in the case, Judge Dan An ton also abstained, on the grounds that his daughter is in a concubinage relationship with one of the rapists’ lawyers.
The two judges decided that the rapists from Vaslui should remain in pre-trial detention.
The prisoners will remain incarcerated for at least another 30 days, when the judges will re-discuss the possibility of their release.
The next trial will take place at the Ia<0xC8><0x99>i Court of Appeal on 6 October.
Before arriving at the Iasi Court of Appeal, the van with which the rapists were transported from Vaslui was involved in an accident in the P<0xC4><0x83>curari district, the car entering Iasi on the belt.
The Iveco van carrying the seven rapists hit a Volks Wagen car coming off the Canta road, and the driver tried to turn left.
The van was running from the end of P<0xC4><0x83>curari.
The car entered Ia<0xC8><0x99>i this way because the employees of the Penitentiary Administration preferred the route from Vaslui to Ia<0xC8><0x99>i on the Stables, then on the ring road.
They shortened the route by a few miles.
Immediately after the impact, the escort of the detainees called another transport to take over the detainees.
In a short time, a car was sent to the scene of the accident from the Iasi Maximum Security Penitentiary, which took the seven detainees and transported them to the Court of Appeal.
As a result of the accident, none of those arrested were injured.
To transfer them to the other van, the guards surrounded the backs of the cars and the detainees sped off, two by two.
"The incident was not reported to the police, because the drivers of the two vehicles agreed amicably on the damages to be paid," said Chief Commissioner M<0xC4><0x83>d<0xC4><0x83>lin <0xC8><0x9A><0xC4><0x83>ranu, of the IPJ.
The Great Migrations
Romania is not and will not be ready for what is to come.
What about Europe?
I say it from the beginning, clearly and bluntly: the 7000 refugees that Romania should and must naturalize represent, in itself, an insignificant number, but huge compared to the capacity of the Romanian state to manage such a project.
For Romania, even the voluntary quota proposed by Bucharest, amounting to about 1500 souls, far exceeds the good intentions of solidarity with the European Union expressed in recent months.
Certainly, if those migrants really accept to settle in our localities, the chances of integrating them quickly into the Romanian society are extraordinarily small.
They will be the first to lose their patience.
Parasitized by the underworld and paralyzed by a venal political class, the Romanian state proves impotent in all areas.
The inability to integrate the Gypsies is just a trivial example.
In addition, governments of any color have not been able to absorb European funds, make roads, kindergartens or modern schools, provide decent healthcare, collect dirt from the street, create decently paid jobs or keep their own young generation at home.
Why would refugees settle in another country from which they are fleeing?
But what causes a lot of wonder is in particular the hypocrisy with which such a crisis is treated.
First, we are faced with the bellicose hypocrisy of the strong EU states, which show the utmost generosity when it comes to sharing their troubles with smaller countries.
Then comes the fearful hypocrisy of Romanians who, although they have millions of relatives scattered all over the world, do not yet accept the other - of another language, of another religion, of another blood.
Probably for fear of someone stealing his national being.
Finally, there is a hypocrisy of many migrants, who, although they invoke only the horrors of war as the reason for leaving, do not accept any other destination of the exodus than Germany or the Nordic countries.
Not all refugees are Syrian, and there is no war in Pakistan.
Also, the simplistic way in which the crisis is analyzed can only be mocked.
The causes must be eliminated, some argue, and, relying strictly on the book of political correctness, they demand peace and investment for the migrants’ countries of origin.
But in Romania there is peace and even more, from time to time, some foreign capital enters the national economy - but this does not prevent tens of thousands of Romanians from leaving their country every year.
Why is he leaving?
In this crisis, the European Union has revealed itself to us as an ankylosed construction, divided and overcome by the situation.
I complained that Romania is not able to invent a country project, but here is the fact that the EU does not have any future plan.
Improvisations and threats are of no help.
Then, what good is the EU if the only advantage that Romanians enjoyed – the right to free movement – could be called into question because of the waves of refugees who cross the borders like through cheese?
At some point, the war in Syria will end.
But not the migrant crisis.
In the coming decades, overpopulation, poverty, climate change, resource depletion, etc., will push millions of desperate migrants, from Asia and especially Africa, towards a better life.
With such politicians, Romania is not and will never be prepared for what is to come.
7,000 euros a year to rent the Pogor Club.
The destination, practically, imposed
The auction for the concession covers a period of 10 years.
After 7 years in which it remained closed, the club in the courtyard of the Museum of Romanian Literature is offered by the County Council for concession for a period of 10 years.
The construction has a usable area of 134 sqm, on two levels of hrube.
CJ accepts as destinations given to the building only those of literary café, bookshop or other cultural activities.
The building was valued at 68,300 euros, the starting value of the auction being 6,830 euros annually, with a bidding step of 25 euros.
The concessionaire will have to continuously and permanently operate the building and fully cover the rehabilitation costs of the building, in accordance with the technical project to be drawn up.
"The Pogor Club building is in an advanced state of degradation due to the fact that during the period in which the public feeding unit operated in these spaces and even after its evacuation, no current repair and maintenance works were carried out as they are currently necessary during the operation of a building", it is mentioned in the documentation related to the tender procedure.
Concession offers from the club are expected by September 18.
Two brothers from Tome<0xC8><0x99>ti swallowed sleeping pills.
They were taken to the hospital
Two 9-year-olds and 11-year-olds from Tome<0xC8><0x99>ti, Romania, swallowed several Diazepam pills.
They found the pills in the house and took them out of curiosity.
Their mother was undergoing treatment, and the drugs were not hidden.
The children were rushed to the "Saint Mary" hospital in Ia<0xC8><0x99>i.
They are in stable condition, as the doctors say.
EXCLUSIVE: A meeting that breaks your heart.
At the age of 20, he received a courageous gift: his biological parents.
Lost in the hospital in unclear conditions, in the dark of the 90s, when she was only two months old, small, sick and helpless, and then adopted by a wealthy family in Italy, in the same year in which adoption was vaguely regulated, a young girl comes out, now a blonde and beautiful girl who has never met again.
Crina will turn 20 these days, and her adoptive parents in Palermo thought of offering their beloved daughter an amazing and courageous gift: a visit to Romania, to Iasi, to know her unclear past.
"Ziarul de Ia<0xC8><0x99>i", who witnessed the efforts to search for the family of origin after some extremely vague clues, witnessed these meetings that practically break your heart.
Reporting by reporters, the emotions of the moments, the statements of those involved, their reactions are downright moving and overwhelming.
The story of Crina begins 20 years ago in Ruginoasa, when she was only two months old.
Then, due to a health problem, the girl had to be admitted to the hospital in the city.
At home there began to be disagreements between the parents, and the mother was forced to leave the house.
He decided to keep the girl and send me home.
He stopped the girl, and since then I have not known anything.
“When I found out that he was in the hospital, it was too late,” Alina, the girl’s biological mother, recalled.
Crina was admitted with her grandmother to the municipal hospital in Pa<0xC8><0x99>cani, and at the same time the girl's father, Costic<0xC4><0x83> Balcan, went to work in the city of Alexandria, Teleorman County.
Their lives would be forever separated.
They never found Crina in the hospital.
After admission, Crina's father went to work in another locality, and returned after six months.
Meanwhile, the girl was transferred to the hospital in Iasi, and her father, when he returned, could not find her.
I think it's been almost nine months since the girl was in the hospital.
"She must have thought she was abandoned," says a granddaughter of the family.
Due to financial problems, the grandmother could not come with Crina to Iasi, and the girl remained in the care of the doctors.
Because no one was interested in the fate of the child in all this time, she was taken over by the General Directorate of Social Assistance and Child Protection Iasi, which then gave her to the care of the Placement Center in Bucium.
There were years when abandonment and adoption were more easily regulated than today in Romania.
At the Bucium Center she was found by the Italian Salvadore and his wife, a couple from Palermo who wanted to have their child but failed.
They fell in love with the blonde Crina, and after some time she would move permanently with them to Italy.
The little girl had already spent almost two years, as long as the adoption formalities lasted.
When I saw Crina, I felt she was our daughter.
“It’s like my wife gave him life,” Salvadore, the adoptive father, tells us with a smile as he grasps the girl’s weak hand in his palm.
In the country, Crina’s parents, Alina and Costic<0xC4><0x83>, continued their search separately, each as far as he could.
The father asked the authorities in Ruginoasa, but received no answer where his child could be.
The police then told her that she may have died, but in Ia<0xC8><0x99>i her parents found out what really happened to their daughter.
When I looked for her here, they told me in court that she's gone to Italy, to Palermo.
And conditions to look for it I did not have anymore.
We prayed to God to be well.
I thought about her in all the years that have passed, but there were no possibilities for us to walk, to find her.
"It's hard," she tells us with tears in her eyes, the biological mother of Lily.
But even as the years passed, Ruginoasa’s parents were not forgotten.
In Italy, Salvadore and his wife explained to the girl where she came from and that her past ties her to Romania.
I was little when I found out.
I think I was five or six years old.
I reacted like a child, I was curious.
“I wanted to meet my parents in Romania,” says Crina.
And her dream was going to come true.
In March this year, Commissioner Romic<0xC4><0x83> Ichim, director of the Regional Centre for Drug Prevention, Evaluation and Counselling Ia<0xC8><0x99>i, was contacted by an acquaintance from Italy, who explained to him Salvadore’s desire to find the biological family of Lily.
And the search was based on a name.
After the request we had from our partners in Italy, we started the first steps.
I had received only one name, Balcan Costic<0xC4><0x83>, then the locality, Ruginoasa.
Soon I had an activity with the town hall there, and I could ask if there is by town the name received.
Then they gave me some indications, except that the person found was not the one I was looking for.
“It took us about a month to find the girl’s biological father,” said Commissioner Romica Ichim.
In total, it took more than three months for the authorities to find Costic<0xC4><0x83> and Alina, especially since each one was domiciled in another locality.
We started somewhere in March, and in June-July we completed the identification of the biological parents and the discussions.
"Then we decided that a first meeting will take place in September," Romic<0xC4><0x83> Ichim added.
Last weekend, Alina and Costica saw for the first time their lost daughter in the hallways of the hospital in Ia<0xC8><0x99>i, 20 years ago.
The father, excited, could barely control his tears, and his hands trembled incessantly.
He barely exchanged a few words with the people around him.
A week before the meeting, he couldn't even sleep.
He was still excited, trembling.
“To see your child after so many years is something,” says a granddaughter, who also came with Costic<0xC4><0x83> from Ruginoasa.
Meeting Lily with her biological mother and brother
In discussions with his daughter, who is about to study at a high-ranking university in Italy, Costica Balkan told him, among other things, that if she ever wants to return to him, in the village, she should come quietly: she can give him some sheep, goats, so that he can find a boy from the village and start a household.
My mother is also excited, she cries, and she hardly thinks that this can happen to her.
I'm very excited.
I never thought such a thing could happen.
I’ve seen cases like this on TV, I’ve thought about it all these years, I’ve hoped, but I didn’t think I could be like this.
They are very big emotions.
If he could forgive me.
I hope to see you in the future.
“I hope we can keep in touch,” Alina, the mother of Lily, tells us with tears on her cheeks as she holds a napkin tightly in her hand.
In him she still hides her tears, happy, because in a short time she will see her face after such a bitter time.
On the other side, Crina, who will turn 20 in just a few days, is trying to calm down like an emotional child.
She doesn’t know what to expect, but she’s sketched out a vague idea about her biological parents.
He thinks they are young, but now before the meeting he tries to gather his thoughts, because he has a lot to say, but nothing to reproach.
My parents are two mothers and two fathers.
My parents are the ones who raised me.
It will be a beautiful meeting, a wonderful experience.
“I hope to have a beautiful memory with them, because now there are so many things to say,” Crina confesses.
The first family reunion in Ia<0xC5><0x9F>i
In the Square of the Union, under the sky of the beginning of autumn, the family from Ruginoasa unites again their destiny with their daughter from Palermo.
Crina is now 20 years old, finishing high school, following the Italian school model, but she can start a new chapter with Alina and Costica, her biological parents.
I no longer divide them by borders or countries, but only by one barrier: that of language.
Over which, with the help of a translator, an Italian local owner in the center of Ia<0xC8><0x99>i, passed easily.
Those who have managed to make this meeting possible say that it is the first event of its kind, and that in the future, if the opportunity arises, they will do it again.
It is the first event of this kind organized, of such emotional charge, and I am happy to be a success.
We, at the Center, have different activities, and most of the time we are associated as an institution that deals only with people who use drugs, people who are addicted to drugs.
But we're trying to give society something good back.
“If I am asked for such an event, I will do it with great affection,” says Romic<0xC4><0x83> Ichim, director of the Regional Center for Drug Prevention, Evaluation and Counseling Ia<0xC8><0x99>i, smiling.
Behind him, the Balkan family, with Crina in the middle, walk away telling stories.
They have a lot to say to each other.
Armistice with weapons at PSD yesterday.
Everybody's pulling their soul
The camps of the Iasi branch of the PSD have concluded an armistice with the weapon at their feet.
After successive rounds of talks, held from Friday to Sunday, the first being the most tense, PSD leaders agreed to temporarily suspend hostilities.
Pressed by the executive chairman of the party, Liviu Dragnea, to present a united position, the Iasi social democrats will send him a whole list of potential candidates for the positions of the party.
Far from being over, the internal war in the party seems to have taken only a pause to allow the fighters to draw their soul.
He did not give an ultimatum.
He launched a very simple and very timely message in the present conditions: try to find a solution so as not to endanger the party.
On October 3, we have elections in the party.
All functions will be made available to those who want them.
"Until then, we remain in the existing structure," said the interim mayor, Mihai Chirica.
The two days of discussions over the weekend only led to the conclusion that nothing definite has been established.
In the October elections, a fierce competition is expected for the position of president of the PSD county branch.
On the short list of possible candidates for the main office in the Iasi branch of the party are Secretary of State Maricel Popa, Senator Florin Constantinescu, Senator Sorin Lazar, County Councilor Vasile C<0xC3><0xA2>tea and Acting President of the County Council, Victorel Lupu.
To these could be added the mayor of Schitu Duca, Mihai Mihalache.
One option being considered is the candidacy of the leader of the PSD county councillors, Cristian Stanciu, if Lupu will no longer register in the race, sources within the party stating that he is not interested in the position.
The only name that was not mentioned by any of the participants in the negotiations in recent days is that of the former leader of the branch, Mayor Gheorghe Nichita.
The list of candidates is open.
According to the statute, even on election day can be submitted candidacies, and it would not surprise anyone if it happened.
“The important thing is that we remain united, and we will remain after October 3, when we will have a new Executive Office, a new Permanent County Office and all the new leadership structures,” said C<0xC3><0xA2>tea.
Until the internal elections are organized, the leadership of the PSD county branch will be provided by Victorel Lupu, a close friend of Nichita and Stanciu.
Lupu, however, is on leave until September 29, the preparation of the elections being practically ensured by the executive secretary of the branch, county councilor Mihail Popescu, who is in cold relations with the Nichita camp.
Contacted by phone, Cristian Stanciu appreciated the discussions in recent days as leading to "a partial consensus".
There is a wide availability to maintain balance and unity in the party.
A partial consensus was reached, in the sense of supporting a unitary team to deal with the county.
“But, on the other hand, there are several variants on the intentions related to the candidacy for the PSD Iasi presidency, the list remaining open,” Stanciu commented.
A judge from Ia<0xC8><0x99>i refused the case of rapists from Vaslui on the grounds of concubinage
The seven young people from Vaslui County convicted of rape arrive today at the Ia<0xC8><0x99>i Court of Appeal.
The Vaslui sentenced to sentences of between five years and eight months and eight years and four months will present their arguments on their release today, after the court of Vaslui ordered their incarceration immediately after the sentence.
The case was registered at the Court of Appeal at the end of last week, with magistrate Dan Anton making a request for abstention, admitted by his colleagues.
Anton invoked the fact that one of the defendants’ lawyers, lawyer Bogdan Luca, is the concubine of his daughter, lawyer Dana Anton.
Luca defends Silviu Ovidiu Burada, the one who received the highest punishment in this case.
How the Judges Motivated the Sentence
At the end of last week, the magistrate of Vaslui Court who sentenced the seven young people motivated the sentence.
In the motivation, the judge talks about the defiant reaction of the defendants, but also of those who supported them, stating that such attitudes create a strong feeling of indignation among the public opinion.
"The court notes that after the preventive measure of judicial control, a restrictive measure of liberty but not a deprivation of liberty, under the impact of the attitude of the defendants, their families and their local supporters, a strong feeling of indignation was felt at the level of the local and national community regarding the fact that the persons accused of serious acts are judged under a measure", Vassari added.
The magistrates also dismantled the main defense of the seven defendants who during the trial invoked the fact that the girl they raped would not be "the church door".
"The court stresses that the moral quality of the injured party is irrelevant, an aspect that the defendants wished to highlight in their defences, since a person's physical and sexual freedom cannot be infringed under any pretext," the statement said.
Corbyn, Brexit and the future of Europe
For economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity they have enjoyed in the past decades cannot continue in the years to come.
By Saturday, few people in Romania knew who Jeremy Corbyn was.
Even today, after he has become the new leader of the UK Labour Party, many wonder to what extent the election of a politician who, after all, is not in a decision-making position can affect us.
Jeremy Corbyn is the most radical left-wing Labour leader since the war.
A declared Marxist, anti-monarchist (he once asked Tony Blair, then prime minister, to take the royal family out of Buckingham Palace), a fierce anti-American and a sympathizer of Vladimir Putin (he was also regularly invited to comment on political events in Britain and nuclear weapons by the "Russia Today" television channel), and on the terrorist movements of the United States.
For Corbyn, who at the time considered the killing of Osama bin Laden a real tragedy, ISIS is close to America’s favorite.
Following the model of all populist demagogues, Corbyn has, of course, miraculous anti-austerity solutions.
Things like what Tsipras was saying and promising in Greece until he came face to face with the real world and economic legacies.
The economic programme of the new Labour leader foresees, among other things, massive renationalisations and the printing of money as a solution to finance development projects and to cover very generous social benefits.
Of course, some may wonder why the solution with money printing is not unanimously adopted on the globe, we would then have a global general prosperity!, but who can prevent such details.
Of course, we can tax the bankers in blood, you become a kind of enemies of the service of the left, but from what has been seen so many times in the past, not only in the former communist states or in Ecuador or Venezuela, but also in France, at the beginning of the mandates of Mitterand and Hollande.
The extra amounts are quickly swallowed up by the generous, coverless promises made by populist demagogues.
As Margaret Thatcher said, “The problem with socialism is that at some point other people’s money runs out.”
Few give Jeremy Corbyn a real chance of ever becoming prime minister.
In the early 1980s another radical leftist leader, Michael Foot, who was not as extreme in his convictions as the party's new leader, failed miserably in the election.
And then there was still in Britain a working class, in the classical sense of the word, relatively consistent and structured.
And the unions were significantly more influential than they are now.
Under the new industrial landscape, where services are dominant in the workforce as a whole, and extensive automation has made the industry massively in need of a highly skilled workforce, Corbyn’s rhetoric has limited appeal.
But even in opposition, it can influence important developments that can affect us directly.
In its latest issue, the Financial Times believes that the election of Corbyn increases the chances of Brexit, respectively the exit of the United Kingdom from the EU.
The new Labour leader was a consistent opponent of the country's membership in the Union.
In the eyes of the radical left, Brussels is the agent of international capitalism and a promoter of globalization that has imposed austerity on the poor.
When you combine these kinds of ideas with those expressed by the radical right, with anti-immigration rhetoric, and you look at the refugee crisis that is shaking the foundations of the EU, you come up with an explosive mix.
And not just for the UK.
But if the British decide in the referendum, which is due to take place by 2017, to leave the Union the symbolic loss of capital for the entire European project and the deep fault lines created within it by the Euro crisis and now that of refugees, between North and South, between East and West, leaves room for the most worrying scenarios.
Especially since for a whole series of Member States, London was a counterweight to the Franco-German axis (in which Berlin becomes more and more the dominant actor anyway).
It is true that the British business environment, the City, are strong advocates of the country’s remaining in the EU.
But today’s Europe is no longer the Europe of the past.
There are many resentments, which are growing in intensity even in these weeks.
The problem is that Brussels, as I recently had a sample in Jean Clude Junker’s speech, tends more and more to make major decisions over the heads of the great majority of the Member States, consulting with only a few European powers, mainly with Germany.
And this is happening at a time when electoral support for anti-establishment, anti-immigration parties that are at the same time Eurosceptic is growing spectacularly across the continent.
In other words, the negative emotional climate has reached higher levels than ever before in the past.
Hence the conclusion that the Financial Times draws when assessing the chances of Brexit.
The pro-EU option is based on a cold calculation that departs from the national interest.
If voters make the brain decision, then Britain will remain in the EU.
But Corbyn’s victory reminds us of the power of emotion in current politics.
However, Eastern Europe can be significantly affected by such major developments.
Especially if, as expected, we witness a more pronounced integration of the Eurozone, which will push most of the states in the region to the periphery of interest and decision-making in Europe.
Corbyn, Tsipras and Syriza in Greece, Podemos in Spain, even Bernie Sanders in the United States fuel their populist rhetoric from the frustrations accumulated in Western societies.
For economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity enjoyed in the last decades, the generous social benefits, cannot continue the same in the following years.
Under the explosive pressure of the dual crisis, the Eurozone - immigration, both caused by hasty decisions that took into account only integrationist political ambitions, not the ability and willingness of the peoples and governments of Europe to respond to such challenges, the turbulence on the continent, the internal tensions in the EU will increase in intensity and can greatly affect the situation of Romania.
And it’s hard to rule out anything from the point of view of possible scenarios.
The question is whether our main political leaders are able to cope with such complicated situations.
Constantin Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC8><0x99>i, the peasant god.
Rockefeller: "How can I help you?"
BRANCUSI: "Take and sweep the workshop!"
The great sculptor had a great dream: to be someone, to become famous, to be heard about him all over the world.
Behind his fame, however, there is something almost forgotten today, when millions of success stories are delivered to us, recipes for success in life.
That something also has a name.
It's called mud.
What to write about Constantin Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC8><0x99>i?
What's there to say, really?
His face appeared on the bills.
And recently, a well-known bank in Romania hired an actor to play him in an advertising clip.
Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC8><0x99>i produces and delivers money almost 60 years after he is no longer with us.
In Romania, there are hundreds of streets and boulevards that bear his name.
In fact, even the author of this text lives on one of these streets.
And, when he goes out with his child, he hears the following instructions: "We go to the park, to Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC8><0x99>i".
The country is filled with its statues.
There are few Romanian personalities whose works are known by so many people, from children to the elderly.
Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC8><0x99>i’s infiltration capacity is huge.
Even the communists could not extirpate it from the memory and culture of Romania.
His quotes are now spreading around the internet, receiving hundreds of thousands of likes and shares.
And then again, what else would there be to say, to write about this man?
Looked at from the pile of books and articles that try to reconstruct his destiny, Brancusi’s life seems almost fantastic, totally improbable.
You know, it's those people who tell you that if you weren't lucky enough to be born in some big city and into some wealthy family, your chances of success in life are almost zero.
Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC8><0x99>i’s life is the perfect counterexample.
And maybe here would be a key.
Perhaps this is where the text that follows should begin.
With a sentence, however detestable these may be.
Forget the dumb success stories, which are delivered to you daily in newspapers and on TV.
Look closely at the figure of this man.
Do you want to know how he succeeded in life, how, today, he heard an entire world?
It's simple.
He worked his whole life to be someone.
That's what he did.
Constantin Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC8><0x99>i was born on February 19, 1876, in Hobita, a small village in the commune of Pe<0xC8><0x99>ti<0xC8><0x99>ani, Gorj County, at the foot of the Carpathians.
She is the fifth child of Maria and Radu Nicolae Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC8><0x99>i.
Although he came from a wealthy peasant family, Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC8><0x99>i led a modest life, but one of which he would gather the landmarks that would guide his late artistic vision.
Recalling his childhood and the places where he grew up, the artist would confess, in a meeting with Petre <0xC8><0x9A>u<0xC8><0x9B>ea, from Paris, in 1933: "Back then life was beautiful and harmonious".
For millennia, people have happily led patriarchal lives.
Everything passed quietly from one season to another.
And do you know why things have changed?
The civilization of the great city has come down to us.
Brancusi’s childhood, however, was far from idyllic.
One of the moments spent in these first years of life is extremely suggestive for the combination of purity and violence that characterized the future sculptor of the years spent in his native town.
The moment is reproduced in the work "Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC8><0x99>i. A biography", written by Alexandru Buican.
In 1879, Constantin Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC8><0x99>i was 3 years old.
In the autumn of that year, when the cauldron was being made, watching those who tasted the liquid to see if the process was taking place properly, Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC8><0x99>i caught a moment of general inattention.
He fills his palms with celery and drinks from it.
He falls asleep almost instantly.
The first people notice it only after a few minutes.
The mother panics, then hysteria, thinking her son has died.
In the evening, when the father, Radu, returns from the vineyard accompanied by lutes, he sees from a distance the desperate signs of those who are waiting for him with their hearts in their mouths.
The party immediately turns into mourning.
The father is already thinking about the burial.
However, someone finds it good to call Baba Brandu<0xC8><0x99>a, the doftoroa and servant of the Brancu<0xC8><0x99>i.
The cheese checks the child’s breathing, then puts the horse dung, gathered around him, under his nose.
The baby sneezes hard.
The world applauds.
While the boy is left to sleep on his drunkenness, with joy, the party with lutes continues with even more force.
The next day, the father and son meet at the orchard.
Radu Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC8><0x99>i asks Constantin to gather some sticks and bring them to him.
The father places his child upside down and, with the rods brought by the boy, beats him to remember.
And, while feeling the sting of the blows, little Brancusi has the revelation that the world can be seen from another perspective and that the things around can appear upside down.
Especially the position of the sun, different from the well-known one, makes him wonder, as he would recognize in his old age, whether the sun itself was participating in his disorder.
Was the sun as disturbed as his father was by what had happened to him?
The city is not working at the moment.
A member of parliament calls on politicians to remember those who voted for them.
Independent deputy Viorel Bl<0xC4><0x83>ju<0xC8><0x9B> called on PSD and PNL to stop internal struggles and reorient their agenda towards the electorate.
What we see now on our political scene is a great divide and that’s all.
I haven’t seen anything from the USL projects in 2012 that will continue.
Neither the highway nor the Regional Emergency Hospital, you just see how the politicians dispute their possible locations according to the real estate interests.
Let’s put politics aside a bit, let’s get together and talk.
The city is not working at the moment.
"If you are busy with the internal war, you have no time for those who elected you," Bl<0xC4><0x83>ju<0xC8><0x9B> said.
He appreciated that the current political class has disappointed the Iasi electorate, the consequence of which will be a very low presence in the future local elections, around the figure of 30%, practically representing the loyal electorate of the parties.
The MP also believes that voters will also turn to traditional parties, expressing their reservation towards new political initiatives, such as the "For Iasi" party that will be launched today.
Local parties have very little chance and will only break from the right-wing electorate, not the PSD.
Such parties are based on civically active people, who are usually right-wing.
“The right is crumbling even more, which is not good for anyone, not even for PSD,” Bl<0xC4><0x83>ju<0xC8><0x9B> said.
He said he was not interested in running in the upcoming local elections, dismissing rumors about his intention to run for mayor.
I said I don’t want to run for any local office.
I wonder if I will continue as a member of parliament in the future.
I tried to appeal to unity for Iasi and in the discussions in the hallways, with the other parliamentarians, and I was accused of wanting to make my image.
I don't want to, but we can't go on like this.
“If people voted for us, it doesn’t mean they are stupid to vote for us if they don’t see anything,” said Bl<0xC4><0x83>ju<0xC8><0x9B>, who said that the main reason why the electorate is no longer interested in politics is the hypocrisy of the elected.
A colleague from T<0xC4><0x83>t<0xC4><0x83>ra<0xC8><0x99>i said that he doesn’t have enough money and he has to take the bus.
Let's not be hypocrites.
There is little money.
Sometimes I feel ashamed to take the money from the cashier.
At the end of my term of office, I will report on everything I have spent, apart from the salaries of the employees of the cabinet and its maintenance.
I happened to raise in a month and 30,000 lei, with all the transport, accommodation and other accounts.
"To tell a parliamentarian that the money is not enough is pure hypocrisy," Bl<0xC4><0x83>ju<0xC8><0x9B> concluded.
