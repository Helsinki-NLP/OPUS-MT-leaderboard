Populist right triumph in Austria, together they make up 29%
The early elections to the Austrian parliament have brought, according to the first approximate results, an appreciable weakening of both parties of the current grand coalition and an expressive strengthening of the populist right-wing party.
Strong and special losses have been suffered by the Austrian People's Party (OVP), where the position of the current president, Wilhelm Molterer, is seriously reeling.
On the contrary, the leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZO), the head of the government of the state of Carinthia, J<0xC3><0xB6>rg Haider, is preparing his triumphant return to national politics.
According to the approximate results, the Social Democracy (SP<0xC3><0x96>) remains the strongest party in the country with 29.8 percent of the vote, losing 5.5 percent of the vote compared to the last elections of 2006.
Worse, the OVP has still finished, losing 25.6 percent, almost nine percent of the vote.
These are the worst results, literally catastrophic, in the history of these two great Austrian parties since the post-war period and especially for the people who called these early elections.
Still in early July, when the OVP left the coalition, the popular had in terms of preference to the SPO, a considerable advantage.
It is clear, however, that the voters punished them for letting the government shipwreck.
Already in the first reactions to the results there were speculations about the resignation of the party president and, until today, vice-chancellor, Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could be achieved as early as Monday at the exceptional meeting of the party presidency.
Such an evolution would obviously facilitate the path of the constant and more approximate starting point of the electoral results, that is, of the renewal of the grand coalition between SPO and OVP.
In view of the fact that the reinforcement of both parties of the populist right - the Liberals (FPO) have won about 18 percent and the BZO, eleven percent of the votes - and that the Social Democrats at the same time expressed their fears that the same part of the year 1999 when the popular parties negotiated with the populists (then FPO was a unity, but in 2005 the BOmb
Haider has already announced that he is ready to collaborate with any party and that he is assuming his return to Vienna, to national politics.
Also the Green Party has managed to reach the parliament although it has lost slightly and dropped from third to fifth place among the Austrian political parties.
No other party clearly exceeded the four percent limit and therefore, is not part of the parliament.
Schwarzenberg: relations with India may cool
Failing to solve the problem of Czech scientists who have been accused in India of illegally collecting beetles could lead to a cooling of Czech-Indian relations, according to Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg.
The minister said so in New York, after today’s meeting with his Indian counterpart, Pranab Mukherjee.
"If this is not solved then yes, then this cooling would certainly be reached," he said after the meeting, which was organized on the Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said after the meeting that the executive can hardly get involved in legal matters.
However, he said that in the case of Petr <0xC5><0xA0>vácha, who was exempt from prosecution and punished with a fine, the government can negotiate with the local government of Darjiling in whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
“Their problem could be solved,” the minister said.
For Emil Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era, sentenced to three years in prison, it would be best, according to Mukherjee, to appeal to the highest authorities.
Then he can request the exoneration of the case and wait for the sentence to be released, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his colleague expressed himself in the same terms during the meeting.
"He advises to appeal to the High Court and then a pardon would be possible," the head of Czech diplomacy said.
The only way the Czech side can get into the matter is by getting the convict “competent legal support,” the Indian minister said.
He also said that such support is already being provided by the Indian side.
"We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relations with India, which have a long tradition.
The Indians recognize that, too," Schwarzenberg said.
On the other hand, as the <0xC4><0x8C>TK said, he insisted to his colleague that the Czech Republic considers the problem of Czech entomologists of great importance.
“We really consider it a tremendous mistake to imprison and convict these Czech scientists,” he said.
The minister evaded the answer to the question of whether he received from the Indian side the promise that he would take care of the matter.
“I’ve had a lot of promises,” he said.
A Czech referees a fight on the seabed
I approach an electronic wall map, it depicts Australia surrounded by sea.
He is not interested, however, in the continent but a small missing point in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and next to it also the seabed that surrounds it.
The region is, at the same time, as big as a single continent,” says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the thirty-member team working in the UN Division for Ocean and Sea Law Affairs.
His boss, director of the Division, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the exposition and sometimes completes it.
It governs this mood and enthusiasm of work.
The seabed still hides a little-known world, rich in natural sources.
You can find oil and other mineral raw materials, but also unknown organisms to date that themselves carry the key to the development of anti-cancer drugs.
The bottom is greater than the solid earth
The coastal countries have today begun to vehemently dispute the new territories under the sea.
According to the UN Treaty, they take advantage of the rights they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
It is basically the so-called continental border which sometimes extends a few hundred kilometers from the coast of the given country.
It has, according to the Treaty, exclusive rights in all the resources of the continental rim.
"Simply put, by continental rim is meant the part of the seabed and its surface, which is a natural continuation of the continent under water.
It reaches the limit of the sea coast, and often, up to the border of the two hundred nautical miles, that is, pure economic zone,” explains Mikulka.
The request that the given country submits to the Commission, for the delimitation of the outer limits of the continent, must be submitted with scientific technical documentation based on research and measures.
It is the result of a series of years of work preparation.
"One of our tasks is to organize a technical and legal specialist aid commission.
The commission has so far processed five requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For now, only those of the last three countries mentioned have come forward,” Mikulka adds.
Not so long ago, Australia’s success had a global impact as it was the first to essentially expand its marine dominance.
But so did New Zealand – the seafloor area granted to it by the commission last week is 1.6 million square kilometres, almost six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries invested millions of pains for their study.
The gains from the use of the seabed will, as they promise, be invaluable.
Other states are also slowly filing their applications.
They can do so up to ten years from the time they ratified the "Montego Bay Treaty".
Where the continental rim ends, the region of the ocean floor declared by the Treaty as the "common heritage of mankind" begins.
Already here, no nation has an exclusive position.
The right of exploitation in these areas is administered by the Treaties established by international institutions.
“The seabed, however, is not a gold mine,” says director Mikulka emphatically, adding “that its separate areas are legally and clearly restricted and its regime defined by contract.”
Czechs in the Pacific
And today, a part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It is distributed with other countries of the then Eastern Bloc within the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
This was achieved in 1991 with a Treaty as investors as well as a few other states, states called "the pioneer investor".
It has the power to operate in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is somewhat larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The background there is rugged, it is something like a marine replica of the Tatra.
"A surface area of a total extension of 75,000 square kilometers can be exploited.
The area is rich in polymetallic concrete deposits containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese,” adds Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A Macedonian employee of the Division, Rober Sandev, brings us a sample of this type of concretion.
It reminds us of a small potato or with a little fantasy, the Shem, which according to legend revived the Golem.
During the liberation of the hostages the German special forces command was in the place of action
To solve the hostage crisis the Egyptian government had asked for help from Germany – experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special forces command was ready, but the operation was not carried out.
More and more details are known about the circumstances of the release of 11 European tourists in Egypt.
According to data from the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, the German special forces were also indirectly involved in the rescue effort.
Therefore at the place of release were specialists of the German army as well as officials of GSG 9, aircraft squadron of the federal police, the Federal Office of Criminal Investigation and experts in the field of logistics of the technical charity.
As ministry spokesmen reported Monday night, German forces were not needed because kidnappers, realizing a violent liberation, let their prisoners go and escaped.
The Egyptian government accepted Germany's help to use it as support on the spot.
"Fortunately, that time did not come," said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
On 19 September in southern Egypt, the assailants had kidnapped a group of travelers consisting of 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian companions.
After the kidnapping in the southern desert region of Egypt, the hostages were deported back and forth in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers remained unknown until the end as well as the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Meanwhile, the saved people arrived in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages were under the tutelage of the German embassy.
He did not say a word about the details of the release.
At first in Berlin there was no information about their return to Germany.
According to the newspaper "Bild", 5 tourists and special forces have to return by Airbus from the German air forces and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. House of Representatives Fails to Approve Salvation Package
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress let a huge $700 billion bailout package for the financial markets fail with scant success.
The Dow Jones fell dramatically.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government’s package to save the financial markets by 227 votes to 206.
Despite all calls from President George W. Bush and former politicians of both parties did not reach a majority for the program with which disorder in the financial markets should be limited.
With dramatic action, desperate advocates had still tried to convince critics to accept the large $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, the leader of the Democratic negotiations had asked the deputies to make a vote although the plan is not so popular.
“It’s hard to get political approval to avoid something that absolutely hasn’t happened yet,” he said.
Already during the vote the Dow Jones fell to more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The cause of that was investor concerns that the state bailout package might fail.
He rested at the end of the vote and after the failure was made public, he fell again.
Experts are counting on other serious turbulences in international financial markets.
To let the program go into effect, it is necessary to have the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
The organizers record the increase in the number of reservations
It seems to be a good winter for German travel organizers:
According to a study, the sales volume of travel reservations for the coming months increased compared to last year - even the winter season by more than 30 percent.
According to one study, despite the weakened conjuncture, the Germans’ desire to travel remains as it was before.
As reported on Monday by the German Travel Association (DVR) in Berlin, with travel bookings for the winter season travel agencies recorded a sales volume that is 31 percent more compared to the same period last year.
According to the research of the market research institute GfK, the reserves for the autumn months had already increased in number.
Thus the sales volume of travel agencies in October was almost eleven percent more compared to 2007, reported the DVR.
The basis of the results are GfK figures, which are the information analyzed on reservations in 1200 travel agencies and calculated for approximately the entire market.
The data collected are travel reservations made up to the end of August 2008.
Because of the weakened course of the dollar especially trips to the United States are in high demand, reported the DRV.
In this case, the number of reservations increased to almost a third.
The preferred destination points of Germans are not only Spain, Turkey and Greece but also the regions of Germany.
Especially organized trips are very preferred, explains Klaus Laepple, the president of DRV.
In view of the fact that energy and food prices increase, in this case travel expenses are "better calculable for the customer than during an individual trip".
Among other things, consumers can save money with early booking discounts or All-Inclusive deals, Laepple explained.
Also in the summer months the trips were well booked, so that the sales volume compared to last year again went up - although according to another study the number of Germans who made a trip, compared to last year, fell.
My first Oktoberfest
Party hits under the open sky at the endless Spa, beer in one-litre jugs and famous people dressed in traditional Bavarian designer costumes.
A debut in a tent.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She is blonde, the moderator on TV and wears a custom-made traditional Bavarian costume.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is already worn.
But there is one thing that unites us: we are just in tent, the photographers already rushed towards us and filled their memory cards with the photos - it is very flattering especially because I am first time at Oktoberfest.
That's how you make friends.
Cheap traditional Bavarian costumes seem to fulfill their function.
Actually as a tourist at the Oktoberfest coming from the north of Germany my feeling of well-being with a traditional Bavarian costumes until this day was still limited.
But after arriving at the Prado de Teresa everything is not so good.
Almost everyone wears traditional Bavarian costumes or leather pants; none seems to be heeding or feeling unpleasant - everything is absolutely normal.
Only my apron gets weird looks next to a banana stand in the chocolate.
A woman from Munich draws my attention to my apron, which was dressed in the wrong way: "the left side is single, half is the virgin, on the right side she is engaged, behind is a widow."
Oh God, now I buckle up from behind to the left.
"It's okay," he says with a laugh.
The others don’t care about many of the subtle methods of flirting and wear caps where it is written “To drink to get dressed!” and show off, without asking them, their bare ass.
A young boy who behaves in an exhibitionist way is called Bob, he is from England and is also for the first time at the Oktoberfest.
He seems "gorgeous", which he pronounces with a very long "o".
He tells me after he has put aside his glass of a liter of beer that he just drank.
He put it directly next to the fire hydrant, most think that's a garbage can.
Then Bob is one of the famous people who know how to drink a lot.
The others are not very lucky and cannot consume as much alcohol.
At about eight o’clock in the evening, the toilet groups run around the party place and have to worry about poor drunks.
The toilets appear each time in a group - suddenly it is always four people who bring the covered platforms from one tent to the other.
That works as with most visitors: They come sober, they come back drunk.
It is not seen who suffers from the degrees of alcoholemia and is on the scaffolds.
“They’re the ones who ‘can’t take it anymore,’” a health worker told me in response to my question, and he disappeared in a tumult.
Accident Victim Identified by Police
The 63-year-old pedestrian who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex County has been identified.
Carole Paulson, of Chelmsford Road in the town of Brentwood, was involved in the accident that occurred on Shenfield Road on Friday afternoon.
The woman was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
Following the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of negligent driving.
He has since been released on bail.
Turkey expands its diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey intended to become a member of the European Union, European powers had long harbored a desire to penetrate the interior of that country.
In the eastern part of the Bosphorus, perhaps only 20 steps into Asia, lies one of the most interesting relics of disastrous imperial ambition.
The railway station of Hydarpasha was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in neo-Renaissance style.
At least, this is what the guides say.
The building is set to hoe the end of the platforms and has in front of it two towers, one for each corner, resembling a typical German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The building in its complex is a bit decadent.
But once the vaulted box office was passed, there is no doubt of the greatness of the company that this was the westernmost gate.
The station was opened in August 1908 by the German Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a “latecomer” in the imperial game, had the ambition to dominate the Middle East through this railway that was curate up to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond in what is now Saudi Arabia.
However, the ambitions of this imperial Germany failed during World War I.
Its railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
Because of the relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, it fell
British rule and as forces advanced into Egypt, they pushed the Turks and their German ally out of Palestine and Syria.
The news was also bad for Hyderpasha station.
In 1917 an ammunition train exploded destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources said it was sabotage.
Since then the station has been decaying and has remained on the sidelines of history.
But today, this railway, the gateway to Anatolia and all the eastern centers, serves - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's willingness to expand its diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party - the AKP - has planned a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
Now there is a new policy of collaboration.
The Turkish Government maintains excellent relations with Israel and Syria, with both the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To assess the parameters of this new foreign policy, I climbed into a bunk bed and went to the Turkish capital Ankara, in order to visit one of the leaders of the AKP, an expert on foreign policy, Turkish Prime Minister Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a trip of jolts, which produced the cadences of the ancient world in the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital - new city, designed to rule a new secular state, far from the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, with its clear Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift in the Turkish consensus.
This has raised some suspicions in the West, and especially in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern stone and steel structure - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by half-built shopping malls and "power bakeries" where middle-class managers in business suits - men and women - meet early in the morning to agree/do business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a center-right politician of almost any party in Europe.
Suit, tie, I'm sure he still has a Blackberry.
"The aim of the party's foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly," he tells me.
Turkey has been cut off from its internal relations.
Today you have to look both East and West at the same time.
It is not a case if it is not towards one or the other.
You have to do both.
“But surely at some point,” I ask, “Turkey might be forced to choose?”
"Turkey," he replies, "doesn't want to face that choice."
He then underlines a point that almost everyone I have spoken to up to that time had recited to me almost by heart: the relations that Turkey has not only with the Middle East, but with the Caucasus region, and with the entire Black Sea, represent a benefit for Europe and the United States as well as for Turkey itself.
The message seems to be: with Turkey on board, Europe in its complex can metaphorically assemble those railway lines that open the world to East Asia and the Middle East.
Once again to the station of Hydarpasha, after a second sleepless night, my thought goes back to the two German gentlemen, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who had attended the construction of this building, 100 years ago.
How surprised would they be to learn that Europe’s ambitions in the Middle East would largely be in Turkey’s hands today?
And waiting at the terminal for the ferry that will take me back through the Bosphorus, I remember that in those days Turkey was considered "the sick man of Europe."
So, there is not much doubt as to which continent this fascinating country should claim.
Lives to Remember: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (skeleton, September 11) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the Choir.
As part of the musical project for the city, in the following year he founded his magnificent youth choir, Proteus.
It’s supposed to be for under-21s, but by the time the Proteus sang its finale in 1979, several of us were running out of 20s — we just refused to give up the chorus.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological form-changing being) represented the will of the choir and the ability to perform any music presented to it, whether madrigal or Messiaen, regardless of whether unaccompanied or with full orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by this youth choir was often surprising, always exciting, and it was all due to that man’s inspiration and enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant over the years.
Tod often told us to "let the music speak for itself."
He would say, “The composer knows what he wants.
It’s all there, in the music.
We just have to sing!”
His wand was always absolutely clear and precise, though never taxing, nor too flowery.
Whatever the musical skirmish, it always ended on an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any driver should have been a gentleman, this is Vernon Handley.
I knew him very well during the two decades he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Especially in the last 40 years, I have reviewed more than 100 of their concerts and I can honestly say that I have never, ever, been disappointed – otherwise, many times I have been inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of greatness and extreme personal modesty.
He hated drivers who, in his words, simply “sold one or two very well-known war horses around the world.”
We will miss him very much.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In his sequel to William Woodruff (September 25) he states that "in 1946 he resumed studies in economic history at Oxford and in 1950 he won a Houblon-Norman research scholarship... at the same time he was studying for a bachelor's degree, a master's degree and a doctorate."
This is learned in a note by the author of Woodruff in Beyond Nab End, but it is not entirely correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was Professor of Economic History at the University of Nottingham, during which time he completed a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J.D. Chambers, and subsequently published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
He spent the years 1950–51 in the United States, enjoying a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard, and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason Woodruff chose to overlook this part of his career remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino in Faculty of Philology
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino "Flamenco y vida" because his black and white photographs, documentary style, are fantastic.
They caught my attention for their simplicity and for the strength they transmit, always treating the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feeling.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments."
Second round for Honda's best-seller
In November, Honda will begin marketing the second generation of the Jazz.
If its predecessor already had a wide habitability, this new minivan presents an even wider interior space.
In addition to this, refined mechanics increase driving comfort and allow you to save more fuel.
Evolution in the face of revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Jazz presents a line very similar to the model that happens, the changes introduced in this minivan are numerous.
Among others, it should be noted an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
However, before analyzing the new model, it should be noted that this new Jazz comes six years after introducing the first generation on the market.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter time than that employed by other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, Jazz is less well known, in other markets this model is a sales phenomenon.
This is the case of Japan, country where the Jazz has been the most marketed car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
In Japan alone, nearly one million Jazz units have been sold since its launch.
The second market has been that of the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
However, Honda wants this new Jazz to increase sales within the segment.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese firm sold a total of 83,000 Jazz units, in 2009 estimates point to 100,000 cars, which would mean a growth of 17% in the European market.
With regard to the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda’s total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation, the heads of the Spanish subsidiary expect to sell 2,000 units of Jazz in a full year.
The arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to greatly alleviate the decline in sales in Spain.
In fact, those responsible for the brand expect to end the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, which is 4,000 less than in 2007, a decrease of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales Honda has increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
The Japanese firm also expects to reach 2% in 2010.
To achieve this share Honda is confident in the arrival of another new model.
This is the Insight, a five-door, compact-sized hybrid – 4.37 meters in length – from which the Japanese company expects to market about 200,000 units a year worldwide.
By markets and according to the Japanese manufacturer’s estimates, 50% of Insight’s sales will be produced in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be distributed between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of Insight is scheduled for the first months of the year, once its presentation is made in partnership in January in Valencia.
As for the first generation, the new Jazz is growing in all its dimensions.
Its length rises up to 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), the width up to 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the distance between axes up to 2.50 meters, which is an increase of five centimeters.
The height, on the other hand, does not vary and remains at 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in dimensions, the interior habitability also grows.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the inclusion of a new platform and, on the other, to the introduction of the fuel tank in the central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz.
In addition, the capacity of the trunk - which has a double bottom system - amounts to 399 liters, 19 liters more capacity of the first generation trunk.
It should be noted that these measures are of the version with the 1.4 engine, since the trunk capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
Other improvements - in addition to exterior elements such as rear LEDs or the possibility of mounting the panoramic glass - is an improvement in access to the rear seats.
The doors that give access to the second row have an opening angle of 80 degrees, compared to the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
The engines in this second generation of Jazz are also new.
At the beginning of its commercialization, this small model will have two gasoline engines of 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both mechanics incorporate i-VTEC technology that achieves lower consumption, emits less carbon dioxide, achieves excellent mechanical refinement and at the same time achieves a high torque throughout the engine speed.
The first 1.2-litre engine gets 90 horsepower at 6,000 rpm with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 rpm.
This engine - which in previous Jazz reached 78 horses - has an expenditure of 5.3 liters and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous engine, which in the previous generation achieved 83 horses, now it has 100.
This 100-horsepower Jazz 1.4 achieves a combined consumption of 5.4 liters and 128 grams of CO2.
The 'bee car' that avoids collisions
To advance the development of technologies for the prevention of accidents Nissan has been inspired, this time, in nature, specifically, in bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, based on the flight of bees, prevents accidents.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which is the first step in collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at Nissan Motor Co.’s Advanced Technical Center have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Advanced Science and Technology Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, General Manager of Public Relations for Technology and Brand Research and Development, the BR23C is presented as an expansion of Nissan’s four-area Safety Shield.
This robot is intended to strengthen the collision-prevention capability of the brand’s vehicles.
During their flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space that closely resembles the Nissan Safety Shield.
But most important are the compound eyes of the bee, able to see at an angle of more than 300 degrees in all directions, allowing it to fly without interruption within its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, the engineers designed what they called a Laser Range Finder.
It detects obstacles that are up to two meters away within a 180-degree radius in front of the BR23C, calculates the distance to that object and sends a signal to an onboard microprocessor that immediately results in collision prevention.
“The moment it detects an obstacle, the tiny robot will mimic the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by turning its wheels at right angles or greater to avoid collision.
The biggest difference with any existing system is that the evasion maneuver is totally instinctive.
If this were not the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and lead engineer on this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be deflected up or down, or diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to turn its wheels and not in infinite directions and ways like bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot avoids collisions.
“This device only needs to process information every few seconds, and act on that data.
It does not require saving information or intuitive logic from previous maneuvers, so it can work continuously with only a couple of dozen KB of memory.
This may come as a surprise, but we’re not talking about gigabytes of memory, not even megabytes.”
This is the first step in developing new instant collision prevention technologies, a technology that Nissan predicts will be introduced in production cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than the range of lithium ions.
Another possible future application of this technology could be the integration of the unit with a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to his destination avoiding obstacles along the way.
Getting ready to mortgage
It must be recognized that the US Treasury Department, in addition to having a lot of liquid to make injections, is not lacking in ingenuity.
Faced with the crisis, and to prevent Americans from embarking on junk mortgages in banks of questionable solvency, they have created a pleasant and informative game for the browser: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
In other words, the 'Hotel of bad credit'... or of trouble.
The gloomy aspect of this accommodation and especially of its receptionist is to think once, twice and even three times if it is time to ask for a credit.
And, above all, where to do it, which is probably your goal.
It is true that it has useful information, but little detailed.
It is more a page for teenagers than a site for all audiences.
What happens if the game is completed?
There is a dream room inside the hotel.
Something is something, because to buy a better house we don't even talk about...
Morgan Stanley to sell stake to Japan's MUFG
Morgan Stanley has announced the entry into its capital of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first Japanese bank, which will disburse nine billion dollars to acquire 21% of its capital, a news that has been accepted with a strong drop in its stock price.
A week after discovering a tentative deal, both banks explained that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley common shares at a per-unit price of $25.25, or $3 billion.
The agreed price is less than 19 % of the book value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in the purchase of convertible securities, which will ensure a 10% return and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley said the global transaction would be based on a unit price of $29, or 28 percent above its current exchange rate.
Morgan Stanley was down 6.79% at $23.07 each at 17:00 GMT.
“This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to bank holding status,” said Juan Mack, Morgan Stanley’s chief executive officer.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which would have to allow it to diversify its activities but it passes under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
Its alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing the biggest names on Wall Street to behave much more prudently than before.
The modalities presented last Monday also show that the agreement has been modified during the last days: last Monday, Morgan had announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to Japanese for almost 8.5 billion dollars.
" A week ago, Toshihide Mizuno, the CEO of MUFG, explained in Tokyo, " we thought that the stake would have been composed only of ordinary shares.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we have wished to minimize risks and hedge ourselves.”
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley securities 7% below their book value.
And the operation will result in a dilution of about 20% of the profit per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred securities into ordinary shares within a year if they are sold at more than 50% above the conversion price, i.e. at $47 or less, for a given period.
Morgan Stanley says that the capital provided by MUFG will allow it to take investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
A spokeswoman for the group declined to give details on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
Following MUFG’s investment, Morgan Stanley should show a Tier One solvency ratio of close to 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said it has greatly eased its balance sheet since the end of August.
The past few weeks have been grueling for the group, which has seen its stock price halve as the cost of security against a risk of default on its debt soared.
This cost fell last Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the other sole “survivor” of the big Wall Street investment banks after the bankruptcies of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced it had raised $15 billion, in part for Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway group.
Rafael Correa in Quito, this Monday.
Refound the republic around the socialism of the 21st century.
This is the common project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, following the example of his colleagues and friends, he is the third to put to the vote a project for a new Constitution.
Mission accomplished since 64% of voters voted "yes" to the referendum, according to the official results that referred to 80% of the votes.
According to these results, the "no" received 28%, 7% of the votes were null and void and 0.7% were blank.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to obtain half of the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two exit polls and a tally by a non-governmental organization had announced a broad victory for the "yes" vote, estimating it at between 63 percent and 70 percent.
Rafael Correa had also claimed on the night of Sunday to Monday the victory of his draft Constitution.
The “Constitution triumphed in an overwhelming way,” he had assured, congratulating the Ecuadorians who lead the government of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
Thus, Rafael Correa has been congratulated by Chávez and Morales but also by his Chilean colleague Micaela Bachelet.
The elections, which will take place in complete calm, according to the observer mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), referred to a text of 444 points that consolidated the " new socialism " advocated by the president.
The draft Constitution implied an increase in the power of the State over the economy, reserving for it the " development planning " of a country that lived essentially thanks to the extraction of oil by foreign companies and thanks to currencies sent by its emigrants.
Led by Correa, elected in 2006, the bill also grants strengthened powers to the head of state, who can serve up to two consecutive terms of four years each and will have the possibility of dissolving the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he would use this power and seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the president began to establish in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, in which 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
It finally provides for the prohibition of the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American anti-drug operations.
The 19 people kidnapped have been released in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched the assault against the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions kidnapped ten days ago in the desert arrived unharmed in the Egyptian capital after being released on Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they had been released by Egyptian special forces in Chad.
All of them looked good upon their arrival at 3:30 p.m. aboard a special aircraft at the Al Maza military base, adjacent to Cairo International Airport.
Helicopters immediately transported them to the hospital in Maadi, a residential suburb of Cairo, for medical tests, so they have not been able to speak to the press.
"They are in good health" and "no ransom was paid" to the kidnappers, Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garana said at the airport.
On 19 September, these hostages fell into the hands of 35 unknown kidnappers while enjoying an all-terrain safari in a desert area at the foot of Mount Ouanat, in the confines of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, and since then they have moved from one place to another.
The group consisted of eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the travel agency Aegyptous, in charge of organizing the safari.
An Egyptian security official said 30 members of the special forces, flown aboard two helicopters, had launched the assault during the night before dawn.
"An exchange of gunfire occurred, and half of the kidnappers were killed, the others have fled," the official said.
According to him, 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "lightning" unit were sent to Sudan, where they were supported by German and Italian commandos.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini mentioned in Belgrade the role played by secret agents and by members of the Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and effectiveness of our men of the secret services, of the special forces," he said without elaborating.
He also denied paying a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese army claimed to have intercepted during a patrol an SUV on which the kidnappers were on board, of whom six were killed, including the Chadian chief and two were arrested.
It also claimed that they were related to a Darfur rebel group, the Sudan-Unity Liberation Movement, (SLA-U), a claim immediately denied by this group.
Letters - Silent Majority of Culture
A debate on the financing of culture is making headlines and occupying the current election campaign.
It's better this way.
But a sector of our cultural life is always forgotten.
Who will stand up to denounce the miserable sums that are granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical sites that are starving?
Which politician will dare to remind the federal government to neglect its monuments and heritage buildings?
Why don’t we have real laws that effectively preserve our heritage like in Canada and Quebec?
Did you know that the French government dedicates three and a half million euros to restore only the Ch<0xC3><0xA2>teau de Chinon in the Loire Valley?
In the United States, it is written in its Constitution that the protection of heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage has to be protected by all citizens, all elected and all government departments, and all this, in concert.
In Quebec, in the Federation of Quebec History Societies, at least 40,000 benevolent people grouped in 211 societies of history, heritage, archives and genealogy are concerned to look into history, preserve with little money heaps of private archives and preserve archaeological vestiges.
These are often the watchdogs of our heritage, who protest with energy and desperation when promoters and managers throw their bulldozers against our old stones and our forgotten cemeteries.
For when, a monument to history and heritage?
The governments of the Netherlands nationalize a part of the Fortis Bank.
The States of the Netherlands - being the first in Europe - will help with a nationalization of the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis that is in trouble due to the effect of the mortgage crisis of the North American market: the three countries will support in total with 11.2 billion euros to this financial and insurance institution that also has businesses in Hungary.
This weekend the governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands held consultations at the highest level with the president of the European Central Bank and the head of economic competition of the European Commission.
The Fortis Bank is the first to suffer the crisis of the Euro zone in the framework of the international financial crisis that has been occurring in several waves more than a year ago, therefore the decisions taken with respect to the Bank, in a sense can be considered as precedents.
According to the decision taken early Sunday, the three states will buy about half (49 percent) of the property owned by the Bank in their area.
The Bank will certainly sell a part of its business, including mainly the activities - mainly insurance - bought last year from the Dutch ABN Amr<0xC3><0xB3>.
The actions of Fortis began a sharp decline last week and by the second half of the week there were already important signs of crisis in the institution.
However, analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, this bank is too big to allow it to break.
The company’s shares fell 12 percent on Friday alone, the lowest point in 14 years.
Since January, the value of shares has declined by more than two-thirds.
Looking at current stock prices, the total value of the group’s capital in the market is around 14 billion euros, but according to company executives this is not real.
The Bank’s management blamed the sharp drop in Fortis shares on the insecurities of the U.S. market in relation to the approval of the $700 billion U.S. package plan.
On Monday, stocks showed a slight increase.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed as the bank’s new CEO.
The Bank also sought private investors, but so far no one has given a concrete offer.
The Belgian government had previously assured that investors did not have to worry, they will not lose their money.
Among the Bank’s clients so far there was no panic, they did not invade the bank offices to withdraw their money.
Fortis has its own branch in Hungary and has also bought leasing companies.
Fox in the chicken coop
In the United States, life and health insurance companies often refuse to sign an insurance contract when viewing drug purchase data.
Privacy policy specialists fear that the market for personal data will become uncontrollable.
"There are programs for the protection of personal data, which the use of prescription data in all cases is linked to the approval of the given person.
It must be in independent hands, because otherwise, "we entrust the chicken coop to the fox" - quotes the Washington Post to Richard Dick, designer of the prescription tracking program.
Insurance companies make the insurance price and indemnity amount depend on the client’s health status and if they believe the risk is excessive, they simply don’t make the contract.
Before they sent the client to medical control and signed the contract with him knowing the result of the control.
Dick invented a much cheaper procedure ten years ago: with the customer identification number he easily gets from pharmacies the list of medicines purchased in the last year and a half and the program itself draws the conclusion about the customer's diseases and health status.
For example, if you systematically take large doses of cholesterol-lowering pills, it indicates that the level of fat in the blood is practically incurably high, so you are immediately included in a higher risk category.
Numerous versions of the program circulate, some even establish a risk number, so the insurance company in addition to the administration has hardly anything to do, although there are small difficulties in this regard.
Among the disadvantages of the program is for example that some drugs are multipurpose, for example certain substances serve both to treat headache and for heat waves and even as antidepressants.
The latter is a major risk-raising factor for insurance companies while the former do not.
Special companies were set up to consult and process this data, which before acquiring the necessary information from pharmacies, ask for the patient's approval.
The authorities already force them to this, although they did not receive a fine for negligence until now.
Some companies have also developed the results of laboratory tests and combining them with drug consumption data provides more accurate information about the patient’s health status.
More and more companies have access to this data and at the same time it is increasingly difficult to control its use.
There is an exclusive law for the protection of personal health data, but it applies only to insurance companies and those that provide health services.
The bill that gives the authority for the control of specialized companies for the provision of personal data is already before Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is insufficient: he therefore developed his program, which will require the specific approval of the individual for the provision of his own personal data.
It is another matter that such a person can not deny his approval, because otherwise the insurance companies will not sign the contract with him.
So the hens, in spite of everything, are exposed to the fox’s good will.
Global menu of Marseille
EU doubles trade with India
As the European Union and India are reciprocal trading partners, this issue in addition to the other mostly global issues dominated the agenda of the ninth summit.
A Franco-Indian summit will also be held today, to deal mainly with cooperation in nuclear energy.
Although the European Union recognizes that India is a great democratic developing power that should have more say in international affairs but member countries have not yet been able to reach a common denominator on whether they should support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
This issue was not addressed at the ninth summit that began yesterday in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, President of the EU, José Manuel Barroso, President of the Commission, and Javier Solana, the main representative of foreign policy, received Manmohan Singh, Prime Minister of India, with whom they reached an agreement to double their trade to more than one hundred billion euros in five years.
Given that between 2000 and 2007 the exchange of goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an overly ambitious target.
Thus, the existing 26 bilateral civil aviation agreements with India were legally harmonized, so that air transport can also fly in the future.
India wants to sign a free trade agreement with the EU by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the negotiations.
The aim is balance, because while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi is only ninth among the Union's trading partners.
The summit paid attention to global issues.
Both sides condemned the Afghan and Pakistani situation and terrorism – all forms of the latter – and urged the convening of a UN conference.
The conclusion of the Doha round of trade liberalization was also urged, although both sides bear great responsibility for its failure.
The EU has confirmed that it will stick to its energy and climate programme, i.e. until 2020 it wants to reduce pollutant emissions by at least twenty percent.
India also agrees with this, just as at next year’s climate conference a global agreement should be reached and by 2050 the production of greenhouse gases should be reduced by fifty percent.
They also wished to hinder the rise in food prices and supported the convening of an international conference to review the financial crisis.
Today the head of government of India will travel to the French capital, where - in a bilateral meeting - he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Paris is confident that French companies will receive orders worth 20 billion euros to build nuclear reactors.
According to news agency reports, the deal would be for a period of 15 years.
In Frankfurt more than three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the international exhibition of the book in Frankfurt.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will be present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The international exhibition of the Frankfurt book awaits for this edition more than 7 thousand exhibitors from 102 different countries who will occupy the 171.790 square meters of the exhibition with more than 403,000 titles on display and with Turkey as an honored guest.
It will be the undersecretary of the Ministry of cultural goods and activities Francisco Maria Giro to represent the Italian government at the opening ceremony of the Italian pavilion: Italy will be institutionally and effectively present with a point Italy - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
An encounter with the print will follow in the Room Struktur in Hall 5.0 of the Buchmesse: this will be the occasion to present numbers, trends and prospects on the state of publishing houses in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of books by foreign authors progressively decreases over the total of Italian production, and in particular that for adults and adolescents.
Steve Fossett's plane found, millionaire missing a year ago
The remains of the plane of Steve Fossett, the millionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada desert, have been found.
The debris has been found on a plateau at an altitude of 3,000 meters, in the area of the Sierra Nevada of Mammoth Lakes, on the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, there were no human remains.
Wood County Sheriff John Anderson said: “The plane has been located, we have sent a squad, and now we have confirmation that it is what Steve Fossett was flying on the day of his disappearance.”
He said no human remains had been found on or around the plane.
The 63-year-old billionaire was presumed dead in February.
The American office for the safety of the transports (Ntsb) has announced that some hours after the sighting of the remains, a squadron of investigators has been sent that has identified the apparatus: it is own of the Bellanca 8kcab, dispersed since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington in Nevada for a flight of three hours.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the border of Nevada, some personal remains of Fossett have been found by a couple near his home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents with the name of Fossett, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a sweatshirt.
The search for Fossett had been interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The millionaire had conquered a place in history thanks to a long series of firsts.
In 2002, at the sixth attempt, he had become the first man to complete the world tour in a hot air balloon: two lonely weeks of flight.
Three years later he had made the world tour by plane and without stopovers.
Among his records, also that for having flown at 15,445 meters above sea level, over the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don’t expect
An out-of-the-box SUV with an original and well-established design with defined lines and determined angles.
This is, in short, Glk the latest born among the "compact" all-terrain trucks of the house of the star with which Mercedes-Benz has sought to give a window of novelty in this sector.
Proper for the content outside the traditional, it will be unexpected and unconventional, the communication that accompanied the launch of the suv Glk, available in the showrooms Mercedes-Benz from next October 17.
The advertising campaign that accompanied the debut of the new car will launch an unprecedented mode of communication through a 3D advertising campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A project with maxi-posters, articulated in three different phases, that will dominate the central shopping street of Milan, avenue Como, until November 15th.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic version and thanks to special glasses distributed on Avenida Como it will be possible to see the new SUV in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, looking at the images you will have the impression that the car comes out of the poster.
Subsequently, through the use of the innovative Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its details, to be recomposed into a single image.
Without a doubt Mercedes with this advertising is trying to introduce something new in the stereotype of automotive communication.
Will this formula be able to capture the interest of future buyers? we will see.
Who are the Italian Hooligans?
In the Triveneto, the ban on access to sports events is at stake.
But who are those 150-200 girls and boys that Italy is now ashamed of? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia" that has been following the Italian National for years and that until now, to tell the truth, had never created too many problems.
And they had never met the rival’s fans either.
The extraction of the group is right-wing.
The promoters come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
To these from Sofia have been added a small group (few units, actually) from the Campaign and from Apulia.
They have three-colored flags where the city of origin of the militants appears: Saturday night they have been taken out so that they are not identified.
They are inspired by English fans.
In Bulgaria they have found a group of real Nazi fanatics, those of the Levski.
The Figc had made 144 tickets available to Italian fans for the match: all already with the names, so easily controllable.
And the interior minister had already controlled them all: among what they had left for Sofia there was none with a Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) at that time, none that they had forbidden him to frequent a stadium.
Four Italian fans, who had a history of stadium crime, have been denied the ticket and also the trip.
Now the interior ministry hopes to read the acts coming from the Bulgarian police to take action: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) for at least five years to fans who have been arrested or who have been identified in the disorders.
An international Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) that prevents frequenting not only Italian stadiums but also those throughout Europe.
Our hooligans, they'll never set foot in a stadium again.
Thankfully!.
But now there is the fear of imitation: that to those few fifty, others will be added.
“We have to put out this fire immediately and not legitimize those who behave in this way,” the interior ministry said.
Therefore, "eyes wide open" especially in view of Wednesday's National League match in Lecce.
In Apulia there is also a small core of holders from Ultras Italia.
Tomorrow the Observatory meets, on Tuesday the Cams that can also have a section of the Aise (information agency and external security, that is the secret service, which deals with the problems in the stadiums.
"The choirs of Duce-Duce and the raised arm during the anthem of Mameli? In Bulgaria it is not a crime ...".
This is the thought (expressed in an unhappy way) of Domenico Mazzilli, for a few weeks the director of the Observatory of the Ministry of the Interior (he has taken the position that was once Francesco Tagliente and after Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had been Trieste’s head of public security where there is a core of supporters of the group Ultras Italia, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to celebrate the Duce but yes, the behavior of those 150-200 fans has been shameful.
"I do not do the sociologist - adds the no.1 of the Observatory - the attacks are attributed in the countries in which the fact happens.
Until now this group had behaved well now we will see what has happened and we will take it into account for the future.
But let’s also talk about the whistles to Mameli’s hymn: those too are not a crime, but if they allow they are not educational either...”.
