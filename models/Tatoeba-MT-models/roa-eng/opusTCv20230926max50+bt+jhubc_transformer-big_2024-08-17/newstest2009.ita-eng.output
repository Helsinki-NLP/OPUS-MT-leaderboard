The Prague Stock Exchange at the close of the market had a negative collapse.
After the morning crash, the Prague Stock Exchange restored its losses.
CEZ share transactions have reached almost half of the current daily trade.
Since the beginning of Tuesday, the Prague Stock Exchange has rebounded from the day before collapse that was almost 6%.
Behind this decline is the collapse of stocks on Wall Street.
Thus, even here, there is a market reaction to the result of the vote of the House of Representatives in America, which refused to support the plan to stabilize the local financial sector.
Collapse of stocks in Asia
Shares in the Asian stock market plunged on Tuesday, though the indexes later erased some of the losses.
The Hang Seng index of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange during the day canceled almost 4%, but later also a part of the losses stabilizing at 2.5%.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which tracks the movement of Chinese equities on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, fell 3.8 percent while markets were closed in Shanghai.
Shares in the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than 5%, but eventually the losses settled at 4.3%.
The Thay-Wan Stock Exchange, according to the local index, fell by 3.6%.
“The planning of the rescue action is uncertain and this will affect financial markets around the world,” said Joseph Yam, head of Hong Kong’s currency office.
Hong Kong, despite being part of China, manages financial policy on its own, therefore without depending on the Central Bank.
Hong Kong has interest rates at the same level as the United States.
US lawmakers, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, should quickly return to dialogue and approve the proposed financial support.
Otherwise there is a risk that other countries will also suffer consequences.
American stock market crash
The U.S. Parliament on Monday rejected the financial system’s support plan, for which $700 billion (nearly twelve trillion Czech crowns) was to be allocated.
Lawmakers have thus ignored President Bush’s call to back the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would solve the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks fell on Monday, and major stock indexes posted the biggest drop in more than two decades.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell nearly 7% and a similar drop was last seen in 1987.
The index was already falling before the vote, but as soon as it was seen that the bill was not approved, it went into free fall.
Congress has caved: the US government can hand out $700 billion to the banks.
The highest representatives of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of an understanding of economic support for the American financial system.
The vote will take place at the beginning of next week.
US lawmakers broke the ice in the dialogue on the approval of the bailout in the form of economic aid for the US financial system totaling $700 million (almost twelve trillion crowns).
But it is not yet said.
Representatives of Congress, therefore, must define some details of the agreement before publishing the final form of the law and voting it.
The plan to support the financial system will be discussed on Monday on the territory of the House of Representatives.
On Sunday, Barney Frank, chairman of the House Banking and Financial Services Committee, told Reuters.
The Senate, according to some sources, could vote on the plan probably not before Monday.
Economists believe that the announcement that the financial plan will be approved should be the first and fundamental psychological factor that can awaken the financial markets.
Then, however, there will be a return to reality due to the complexity of the mechanisms by which, in practice, market aid can be obtained.
Paulson: the Plan must be effective
“We have taken a big step forward.”
"We have clarified our differing views on the form of the market stabilization package," Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
The final vote could still take place on Sunday.
Delegates from lawmakers met on Saturday and Sunday night with U.S. Finance Minister Henry Paulson to finalize the government’s funding.
These funds should be used to acquire non-transferable mortgage assets from financial companies, which lead financial companies to serious losses and put the stability of the entire system at risk.
“We are in the process of completing the final agreement of the plan that will work and that must also be effective on the market.”
"We still need to move forward with the recovery plan, but I think we're there," Paulson said.
The Signal for Asian Trade
The global financial crisis falls heavily on stock markets that are collapsing sharply.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are trying to reach a final agreement in Congress even before Sunday.
That is, they want to calm investors before trading on Asian financial markets, which are, in order of time, the first to influence the market on Monday following the decision of Congress.
But for now it is not definitively clear when the two houses of Congress will vote on the law and even if negotiations can be stopped at the last minute on some issue.
Lawmakers hope it will be approved in the coming days.
But the law will still undergo many changes.
The total amount provided for the support of the system shall be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion must be made available as soon as possible, as President George Bush has called for.
But Congress can block the rest of the money if it feels like the program isn’t doing its job, blocking the next $100 billion and after the finals, $350 billion.
Bush appreciated the progress in the negotiations.
Although the President can veto this decision, Congress can override his veto.
Despite these changes, the basic thinking of the program has remained, namely to get the finances to buy passive mortgage securities, the price of which has plummeted because of hundreds of thousands of Americans who are unable to pay their mortgages.
“We processed everything.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday and the Senate on Monday,” as the Republican senator mentioned.
President Bush is also pleased with the progress in the negotiations.
Spokesman Tony Fratto said Bush was pleased with Saturday's positive performance and appreciated "the effort by both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy."
Restriction of Golden Parachutes
The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee Christopher Dodd, the main spokesman, said that lawmakers agreed on the responsibility of the financial program, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the closure of the budget of reductions, the splitting of the financial plan.
The new law must also limit so-called golden parachutes for executives of companies participating in the program and is creating a committee that will control the funds.
These should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We’ve worked very hard and we’ve made a big step toward an agreement that will work and be useful for the market and also for all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan counts on helping homeowners who have problems with payments.
The government should negotiate the new mortgage installments it will buy with the aim of lowering monthly fees on installments for debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: psychological support
The proposed plan is, according to Patria Finance’s chief economist, David Marek, a good idea but its realization will be very difficult.
"And that's because we don't know how and for what price troubled assets will be bought.
This will be decisive for how the losses are divided between the financial sector and the government," Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan will be approved now or early next week is not, according to Marek, so fundamental.
"Much more important, it is that already this week the representatives of the congress find an agreement on the support of this plan and that they baptize it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of this agreement that will be approved is at this time more important,” Marek stressed.
Duel to the last blood: MP3 players against mobile phones
We will advise you how to choose
While almost every cell phone can read MP3 files, no MP3 player can phone.
It’s better to just buy the phone.
There are many reasons why you should get a self-employed reader.
The choice depends entirely on the way of use and the needs of the future owner.
Perhaps you would hardly buy an expensive high-quality turntable to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
First of all these musical products do not come out as LPs and from a qualitative point of view for this there is not even an objective reason.
But if your shelves are full of hard-rock, jazz or blues vinyls, you probably dream of such a turntable at least.
It also works with portable music, i.e. compressed music or simply in MP3 format.
Here, too, there are price and quality categories.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend 8 thousand crowns for a reader, just as a Pink Floyd fan perhaps hardly digests the twenty-crown headphones of the market.
Two extremes between which there is enough space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
It is up to the duration of the batteries.
Some high-quality music players are able to do much more than just read music, which is something mobile phones don’t do by mistake.
There is no other device as universal as the mobile phone.
Next to the primary functions, calling and texting, it can read music and video, record both and has a camera, sometimes better sometimes worse and maybe even can navigate.
And if we take smartphones and handhelds into account, you will also have a miniature computer in your pocket.
It’s a small miracle that no refrigerator can do the grilling and no television can photograph anything.
The universality of the mobile phone also brings disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your mobile phone and the sooner the indicator on the screen will require the charger.
And reading music consumes a lot of energy.
Few phones can read music for more than twelve hours, usually, and much less.
In this sense, music players (especially the simplest ones) are much more effective.
As for cheap cell phones do not count that they can last for more than a few hours.
If you still add us, from time to time, some call, get to work for safety another charger, this also applies to the most expensive appliances.
But you won’t have this problem with an MP3 player, even the worst ones last at least 9 hours at continuous functionality with a charge.
A further problem exists when downloading music to your mobile phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited number of devices have the universal USB port and not all of them can be connected to the computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a few memory players are able to do without an adapter for minicards that are not used in mobile phones.
Readers, except for a few exceptions (Ipod) do not need any special software.
Simply fill the device with music via USB from the computer.
Most mobile phones and players create a media library by themselves, sorted by performer name, album name, genre, or user rating.
Some devices only reproduce the tree structure of folders, similar to the Explorer tool in Windows, and some know how to do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
Readers are easier to handle, mobile phones can do more.
When choosing a particular device, focus on the battery resistance, memory capacity, quality and type of audio output and, of course, ease of use.
If you need music especially as a background and if you listen to it every day only briefly on the tram, you just need a mobile phone that reads MP3.
This can be done, of course, on any mobile phone.
You don’t have to worry too much about which formats your phone or reader recognizes.
MP3 players support them all, the global majority of the music you get will be in this format.
In addition to this format, which belongs to the most popular ones, the total majority of devices support music in WMA format.
There is less AAC (format used by the company Apple and its iPods).
The best mobile phones also allow, for example, to buy music online.
Just visit, through the mobile internet, the corresponding pages of the operator (or another provider) and buy the song or album.
This same service could already be a valid argument to buy a mobile-reader.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is poor and is usually limited only to hits of the moment of the radio.
The prices are not really low.
But it is generally assumed that this mode of selling music (whether via GSM, internet or wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry their cell phones with them.
Anyone who wants to listen to something rummage in their pocket while the MP3 player remains forgotten at home.
But it also depends on this, if you always carry behind the headphones or at least the wireless headset.
If not, you can use the built-in player that almost every mobile phone, but only a small part of MP3 players, has.
Perhaps the biggest advantage of mobile-readers will be, for many, the price.
The cheapest ones normally cost less than 3,000 crowns.
For 3 and 4 thousand crowns you will already buy a very dignified walkman.
Usually, however, you will be limited by the absence of an input for the common headphones.
The best and most technically equipped mobile phones and also with the 3.5 mm socket for common headphones, cost up to 15 thousand crowns.
On the other hand, the advantage of readers is, in addition to others, the easy handling.
The simplest ones are not necessarily cheaper (see our choice) anyone can really handle them.
The minimum of the functions, the similarity of the handling once with the common stereo or perhaps the turntable, is obvious.
There is no danger of accidentally crashing the start-up of the mobile internet and consequently a giant bill for data transmission.
Which device to take
Even the cheapest mobile phones (for example Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable memory cards (type M2, microSD etc.).
Also with regard to the purchase of the respective card, fall within the 2 000 crowns.
But be careful
The base models only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2GB.
Only the most expensive ones can do it even with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy an inexpensive MP3 player, take Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not have to spend more than 1,100 kroner.
If you are part of the most demanding listeners preferably take specialized mobile phones - walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have individual keys for MP3 and the convenience of the service thus approaches the same MP3 player.
In this area has made more way Sony Ericsson, which mobile phones of the Walkman line have the same scale of use as MP3 players sold separately.
The MP3 players of the above brands ensure you the same service and the same price category up to 4,000 crowns, but with a larger memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery resistance (commonly 15 hours, in principle up to 35 hours).
The first virtual operator will reach the Czech Republic as early as this year.
Maybe.
Perhaps the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic is quite mature and our operators offer practically all services as their partners in Western Europe.
Here, however, something is missing – a virtual operator that forces the traditional ones to lower the price.
Maybe he won't be missing for a long time.
Of the fact that Czech operators belong to the most expensive ones in Europe we have already written many times on Mobil.cz.
In the end, <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> confirmed this, pointing out that the price of SMS is higher than in the rest of the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of regularization of roaming charges perhaps a paradoxical situation will be created - for some customers of Czech mobile operators SMS will cost less from abroad than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high vis-<0xC3><0xA0>-vis Europe?
The answer is simple, it lacks the competition that would really want to start the clash.
Maybe it sounds absurd, here we have three mobile networks and coverage highly above 100%.
Mobile phone operators, on the other hand, like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this sense, the head of the Czech Telecommunications Council (<0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>), Pavel Dvo<0xC5><0x99>ák, often emphasizes that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is perhaps true that the traditional operator with its own network no longer has many possibilities. (After all perhaps it would be difficult now to find other frequencies).
But there is still another possibility - the virtual operator.
The entry into the market of virtual operators has led to a considerable drop in prices, to which traditional operators would then have to react.
At the same time, even before sharks like Tesko Mobile and Virgin Mobile entered the market, similar rumours were resonating in Britain.
It has been shown, however, that there is a place for such operators and that they can be truly successful.
In the end, for the examples, we do not have to go very far.
In February of this year we informed you of the arrival of the Mobilking virtual operator in Poland.
In just half a year this operator has managed to conquer more than 100 thousand customers and become the fifth largest local operator.
At the same time, Mobilking is behind the financial group Penta, to which U:fon belongs in the Czech Republic, among others.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more concrete target group.
In other words, it needs far fewer customers than a traditional operator to be able to function effectively.
They do not carry, that is, relatively high costs for the creation, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
So in the world virtual operators usually present themselves at low cost, offer calls and SMS at low prices, which is often in balance with the most restricted service offer.
So for example Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS that cost at least half as much as its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows can be a pretty good move even the bet on a group-target not for nothing.
This operator focuses, so to speak, specifically on men.
“Real men choose Mobilking as the operator they like and can trust,” says David Seibertz, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, which produces the virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept can also be affirmed by us, as in Poland.
Vodafone press spokesman Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> said: “The Czech market is relatively small for a fragmented approach, on which most virtual operators rely.
In addition, from the point of view of services, it is relatively saturated."
In the Czech Republic no chance, say mobile network operators
But it seems almost certain that if there is ever an operator in the Czech Republic, Mobilking will not be one.
"There is talk of the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic negotiations do not have many expectations.
The ignition of Mobilking will take place rather in the other countries of our area," Jana Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ková, the press spokesperson of the financial group Penta, said in a telephone dialogue for Mobile.cz.
So he indirectly confirmed that the current operators in the Czech Republic are definitely not very supportive of this thinking.
On the contrary, they try to do everything so that no potential competitor is created.
For some time now, it has not hidden its interest in starting a virtual operator, the GTS Novera group, which would like to take another step to become a real competitor of Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nika O2 in the field of corporate customers.
"We have a great interest in being able to offer our customers not only fixed services but also mobile telecommunications.
And the sooner the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated on this possibility with all Czech mobile network operators.
We have already managed to make progress in negotiations with some of them," says group spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
So maybe better times will come.
Unofficial information suggests that we may need the first virtual operator by the end of the year.
For now, however, around its creation stands an impenetrable wall of silence.
“Right now we don’t believe that in the Czech market there is room for the creation of a full-fledged virtual operator.
The Czech market, unlike other markets, is very specific.
So far no subject with a complex and serious project has turned to us," he mentioned in his statement for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88> of the press section of Telef<0xC3><0xB2>nika O2.
The specificity of the Czech market is also used by other operators.
T-Mobil Press Spokesperson Martina Kemrová adds in a rare agreement with the O2 statement: “For now we have not noticed any commercial project vital and beneficial to both, on which it is possible to continue to build.”
He adds: “It is unlikely that a virtual operator will appear on the T-Mobil network before the end of the year.
By now we should have had a concrete agreement on the table, so that it could be considered on the horizon.”
Vodafone focuses its attention rather on achieving its own 3G license requirements.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> adds: "We are open to the negotiations of potential virtual operators and this especially in the context of the sharing of expenses and infrastructure.
We consider this, from the point of view of customers, the most productive.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a common network for fast mobile internet.”
Competent authorities - with complicit operators
The attitude of the mobile operators can be easily understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to lower prices and thus to a decrease in profit.
Why then facilitate the rise of such a competitor?
The annoyances around the U:fon creation testify that when operators care about a thing they know how to row on the same side.
Perhaps the great pressure was pressing on <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> in the period of creation of U:fon towards the company of T-Mobile.
This testifies to the information publicly accessible from the web pages of <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>.
But right now U:fon serves as the argument for not accepting the virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová commented: "The competitive environment of the mobile market has been further enhanced by the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
With regard to the type of mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that the entry of another competitor would put on him and especially on his high claims services."
The attitude of mobile operators, however, is quite surprising the complete lack of interest on the part of the Czech regulatory bodies.
It is not just about the attitude of the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> which, unfortunately, in the Czech Republic – unlike in Great Britain and other developed countries – has no competence to interfere in economic competition.
That belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (<0xC3><0x9A>OHS).
This, however, in relation to all the problem has taken its typical position.
"The entry of the virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible after the conclusion of the contract for the rental of the necessary infrastructure between the mobile operator and the virtual operator.
No such contracts have been concluded so far because the offer of potential buyers has probably not been interesting enough for traditional operators," said Kristián Chalupa, of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS external relations section, in the answer to our question.
Such a statement by the representatives of the operators is perhaps not surprising.
On the part of the office, which must defend the interests of consumers and, above all, ensure that no one takes advantage of its position on the market, it is more than a delicate matter.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: “Overseas where virtual operators commonly operate, we can observe that their entry into the market has contributed to lower prices for mobile phone services.”
But obviously the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the lowering of prices do not belong to the interests of <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
Truly shocking in the whole situation is the almost exciting harmony of these three operators resulting from their reactions.
The question of whether this is really just a coincidence arises on its own.
Just like the identical price of petrol for all petrol stations, it is certainly the result of coincidence and the competitive struggle.
"The section has found no signs of anti-competitive behaviour regarding this fact and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
No operator has a dominant position, so it has no corresponding greater responsibility for its behaviour on the market.
The tools needed to open up the mobile network market for virtual operators may also be missing from the telecoms regulator," Chalupa mentioned in his statement.
The interpretation of market dominance is one of many controversial points.
Of course, there is <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>'s analysis of the relevant markets, according to which telecommunications is the only market from the point of view of economic competition.
In such a market, of course, no Czech operator has a dominant position.
But some legal experts offer a different approach - the agreement of the network operator is always necessary for the creation of a virtual operator.
And the mobile operator has – after all, logically – the monopoly of its network.
So for a certain portion it must be dominant by force.
But even if we did not admit this argument, for <0xC3><0x9A>OHS it should be a minimum alert that three mobile operators proceed in such a strangely similar way.
At the same time, complaints from stakeholders (including the aforementioned GTS Novera company) show that during negotiations with all operators they encounter very similar obstacles.
Unloading responsibility to YOU in telecommunications is a fairly frequent trick with which <0xC3><0x9A>OHS keeps itself out of the whole affair.
We have already seen this in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to promote the expansion of the rights of <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> in the field of economic competition in telecommunications until the update of the recently approved telecommunications law, despite the fact that, from this, many experts expected the situation to improve.
This fact the representatives of <0xC3><0x9A>OHS must know more than well, but perhaps their interests lie elsewhere.
It can be done when no one is looking
Without realizing it, however, the functioning of these pseudo-virtual operators remains, some of which even exist in Czech mobile networks.
These are companies that publish their price lists for mobile phone services, but they are only partially public.
Usually these are companies that deal with multilevel marketing.
So for example Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a number of others offer their own mobile phone services.
The price lists of these companies usually reach only the predetermined people.
The magic lies in the fact that the company appears to the operator as a classic business customer, who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer you then receive special price offers (and more).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit a similar pre-sale.
"If the cases you are talking about arise, which we will be interested in, it could be a violation of the contractual conditions, and could lead to the conclusion of cooperation with that company," Martina Kemrová answered to the question in question.
But it is quite unlikely that such an activity would not reach the ears of those responsible for mobile operators.
Especially in the cases of the 3 companies mentioned it can be thousands of customers.
No operator defends himself at the same time from such an attitude.
From the activity of these companies they derive a profit that is not indifferent and at the same time - unlike the real virtual operators - they are not damaged in any way with their official marketing.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> warns of possible problems: "The law allows for such speculation, however only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
They must also accept that the SIM card in their phone is not registered in their name, so they cannot fully dispose of it as the regular customers of mobile operators "
But this should be a strange minimum to the <0xC3><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>.
In addition, another issue for <0xC3><0x9A>OHS opens up.
If mobile operators close their eyes to such an attitude, why do they block the creation of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that <0xC3><0x9A>OHS has strong enough rights to expose similar activities and if it does not want it, it will not have to be satisfied with the explanation of the operators who have no idea of all this and that their commercial conditions prohibit it.
When we're no longer expensive
As has already been said several times in the text, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has led to a considerable drop in prices for services.
At the same time in virtually all countries where operators were born, traditional operators more or less tried to prevent their creation.
The arguments they used were virtually identical - too small market, too saturated limit, problems with the quality of services etc.
But in developed countries, in these cases, regulatory bodies have intervened to defend not mobile operators but their customers.
Both with formal measures and with non-formal pressure, then came the creation of the first virtual operator and he was followed by others.
Unfortunately, Czech regulators throw themselves from one case to the next like a hot potato.
In our experience we can not get rid of the feeling that the lack of clarity of skills in these cases makes him more than comfortable.
But let's not throw in the towel.
If the background information is correct and the virtual operator will appear really soon from us, the Czech mobile phone market will get back in motion.
If one of the operators had agreed to the creation of a virtual mobile operator only <0xC3><0x9A>OHS could hardly remain impassive to the rejection (discrimination) of the other interested parties.
And maybe we will stop calling at higher prices than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best one
Listen to the four new versions of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the occasion of the Day of Recognition of the Czech State presented in a solemn way the new recordings of the national anthem "Kde domov m<0xC5><0xAF>j".
The new recording of the anthem was made by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlávek.
There are four versions available – solo with male or female voice, choir pitch and instrumental edition.
The song is conducted by Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>nková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the revisions of the anthem are Otakar Jeremiá<0xC5><0xA1> and Jaroslav Kr<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
You can listen to all four versions on the iHNed.cz website.
B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlávek considers the Czech national song one of the most beautiful hymns.
Already before he told the radio "<0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> rozhlas" that he specifically chose to sing the variants alone, singers with the most representative young voices, which are expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I tried to make sure that both of them and the choir have a clear diction, that the text is well understood, that they are in harmony," he said.
Then the national anthem will celebrate next year the 175th anniversary.
The song "Kde domov m<0xC5><0xAF>j" was first played in 1834 on the stage of the Stavovskéh divadlo in the original opera Fidlova<0xC4><0x8D>ka by Josef Kajetán Tyl accompanied by the music of Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek <0xC5><0xA0>kroupa.
It gained popularity and people spontaneously made it their own.
The first verse of the song after the founding of Czechoslovakia in 1918 then became the natural part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the birth of the autonomous Czech Republic.
How the "new" hymn sounds
The MHD Wednesday in Prague will also accompany you for the first time with an electronic card
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be written in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date on which in the metro, tram and bus the first passengers who instead of the paper ticket will have in their pocket an electronic card.
At the moment it can be procured by about a hundred thousand people who have their own Opencard card.
Passengers can buy the 30- and 90-day annual ticket (which will be valid from January 1, 2009) and at the same time have their card recharged at the Infopoints and offices of the Transport Company and at the metro stops Muzeum, M<0xC5><0xAF>stek, Nádra<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD> Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice, And<0xC4><0x9B>l, Roztyly, Let<0xC5><0x88>any, Kobylisy,
The coupons can be bought yesterday on the Internet at the page of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
More than four hundred customers took advantage of the service before the afternoon.
Those who will start using the service via the internet can completely forget about the counters at the metro stops where until now they had to make long lines for paper tickets.
The coupon can be purchased via the Internet and on the Opencard they recharge it on one of the twelve branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places, passengers have access to a counter with trained staff who will help those interested in the purchase on the internet and will also record on their card the credit acquired," said project spokesman Martin Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD>.
In addition to libraries, it will be possible to upload electronic coupons on the Opencards in ATMs and self-service that are installed at the entrances of the metro.
How are these ATMs?
They are red, they look like ticket obliterators and passengers have already noticed them at the metro stops Roztyly, Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are now five in the whole city, but by the end of the year there should be 80," Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD> said.
The coupon will be checked instead by the driver from the ATM.
The ATM service that will operate from tomorrow is very simple.
Simply enter the Opencard card and after payment of the coupon, it will be loaded on.
The electronic cards are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is, in the urban lines of trains and buses from the number 300 up to 499, which the inhabitants of the municipalities of central Bohemia take to reach the capital.
"In the added trains in Prague's integrated transports there are the controllers with card readers with which they verify the temporal and zonal validity," explained the mode of control of the Filip tickets from the organization Ropid, which fine-tunes the schedules of the collective transports of Prague.
City buses have card readers integrated into the driver’s box.
During the ascent it is therefore necessary not only to show the magnetic card to the driver, but also to place the Opencard at the point determined next to the cashier.
Thus the driver verifies the validity of the loaded coupons.
“If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the loaded coupons, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this type of information,” Drápal added.
Passengers who take urban buses and will not remember, when the validity of the coupon expires, can again go to the self-service ATMs, where the coupons are loaded on the card.
Here you will see information about the validity of their documents on the screen of the device.
The Germans of the Sudetenland wanted a referendum from the United States.
The Sudeten Germans in 1945 asked to include <0xC5><0xA0>umava in the United States.
This results from the letter deposited in the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the patronage of the United States.
With this desire, it is said, some groups of Sudeten Germans turned in 1945 to the President of the United States.
This is most evident from the letter kept in a private archive and now deposited in the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
The Germans of <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> Krumlov ask in the letter to the American president not to allow again the return of the "Shumava district" - occupied by Hitler on the basis of the Munich agreement - to Czechoslovakia.
“We have understood the situation and want to be sure of the promises that American units will come to German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators,” the letter, signed by the Germans, said.
Since, they say, the annexation to Czechoslovakia – knowing the Czech national character – gives the Sudeten Germans hope only for brutality, lack of regard, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter plead with the American president to assume the protectorate over <0xC5><0xA0>umava now and always.
“We cannot believe that without regard for the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants, you would recognize this territory as a state alien to us, which oppresses and uproots ethnic minorities and has contributed nothing, at all, to the victory of the Allies,” the letter reads.
The reason the authors cannot sign it is the alleged fear of the thirst for revenge on the part of the “Czech oppressors”.
Should the US president doubt the <0xC5><0xA0>umava Germans' belief, it would be enough to organize a referendum in the district on the will of its inhabitants to become part of the US or to live under the mastery of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may seem naive with our knowledge of post-war history, according to some witnesses it appropriately describes the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at the time.
Even if the Czech Germans had to in the slightest sense that it would be their displacement from the republic, only a few of them fully admitted such a possibility.
Some expected the United States and Britain to negotiate some sort of autonomy for the peoples of the Sudetenland.
Others believed that they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice.
He was mobilized during the war as Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice's German in the Baltic Sea maritime power.
When at the end of the war he was captured by the British and put in the prison camp at Hol<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC3><0xBD>n, dozens of other Czech Germans went to visit him for him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that once they got home the Czech would be comfortable for them," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war, according to him, counted on the fact that on the basis of Bene<0xC5><0xA1>' decrees they would be moved from the Republic.
You don't think - you'll pay!
The emotional campaign will attack the drivers
The most expensive road safety action in Czech history.
Even so we could define the emotional media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport plans to start on Wednesday.
Minister Ale<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0x98>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek's office expects this to discourage drivers from dangerous driving behaviour.
The $150 million campaign will appear on television, radio, film, and the Internet, as well as on flyers.
It should discourage drivers from driving fast and under the influence of alcohol at the wheel.
And also remind him to put on his belt before leaving.
It wants to touch in the conscience especially young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and last but not least professional drivers.
What will appear in the ads?
Especially stories of people that will affect emotions.
And this is also evidenced by the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign:
You don't think - you'll pay!
The word "don't think" is capitalized on the license plate.
And in a pool of blood is the word "you'll pay."
This should symbolize that a person can in a moment of distraction pay with his life.
The ads will "scary" viewers until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can commonly see images with drastic scenes of accident victims.
It promises to reduce the number of accidents and deaths on Czech roads.
The ads were prepared by the agency Euro RSCG.
Carrot and stick to drivers
"With drivers the carrot and stick system works.
The carrot for them is for example when they pass with the red and thus save time.
The stick is the danger of the fine or the accident.
You have to remind drivers of the risk," says psychologist from the Ministry of Transport Martin Ko<0xC5><0x99>án of the Na Homolce hospital.
And therefore we need information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertising, believes the psychologist.
According to him, the panels that warn drivers of the danger are already less effective.
“If the fixed panel warning of danger has been installed, it will probably soon become confused with the environment and drivers will no longer pay attention to it,” warns Ko<0xC5><0x99>án.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has called for the return of virtually all of the territories occupied in 1967, including the borders of Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace between Palestinians and Syrians.
So he said in the dialogue he published Monday, the daily newspaper Jediot Achronot.
"We have to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all the (occupied) areas, if not all of them," Olmert told the newspaper.
“We will keep a certain percentage of these territories but we will have to leave the same percentage to the Palestinians (of the Israeli areas), because without this there will be no peace,” he added.
He admitted that the eventual restitution would also include East Jerusalem.
"Anyone who wants security in Jerusalem and above all does not want bulldozers or bulldozers to come over him, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up a part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in reference to the two July attacks in the city, during which some people were killed and dozens injured.
According to the premier it will be necessary to find "a particular solution for the Temple Mountain, the sacred and historical places," which lie within the Old City.
"Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he also stressed.
The retreat from the Golan Heights
Olmert also spoke out for Israel’s withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which, according to him, is the essential condition for concluding this peaceful agreement with Syria.
But that would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
“I do not propose the conclusion of peace with Syria solely on the basis of the withdrawal from the Golan,” he warned.
“The Syrians know what they will have to give up in order to get to the Golan Heights.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with Hezbollah (the Shiite movement); they will have to give up the permanent support they offer to Hamas terrorism, Al-Qaeda (the Shiite movement) and Jihad (the holy war) in Iraq.
Questions after the accident: Are stewards on buses illegal?
The law does not recognize them, you can not walk on the bus that makes long distances
In the context of the tragic accident near the Italian city of Padua of the Student Agency bus company, the question arose whether stewards and passengers can move on board the bus during the race.
"If we want to comply with the laws strictly and formally, the activity of the steward is in conflict with the law of road traffic," says Ministry of Transport spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The accident last week in which a 22-year-old stewardess lost her life was caused by a truck that cut the road to the bus.
The girl was unfortunately sitting next to the driver in the least safe place on the bus at the time, despite the fact that there were still two other places assigned.
But the bus can make an accident or brake sharply even when distributing coffee or newspapers.
It depends on whether or not the bus is equipped with standing seats according to the traffic book.
If it is not approved, passengers must be seated.
The Student Agency buses do not have standing seats, company director Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura confirmed to the website Aktuáln<0xC4><0x95>.cz.
“We evaluated this with the Ministry and at the beginning it did not allow the movement of passengers on the bus.
After it was revoked, we concluded that passengers can use the bathroom during the race if they have the assigned seat," he said.
The law does not recognize the steward.
“There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of the steward – no law deals with the regularization of this role.”
However, no regulation prohibits the carrier from carrying out the services.
The law of road traffic only recognises the term "driver", his rights and duties are not defined," Hanzelka said.
The director of the Department of Road Traffic of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD> believes, however, that the law takes care enough of this problem.
It depends on whether the bus has approved seats.
That's it," he says.
Categorize buses in urban areas where there are standing places and maximum speed limited, intercity with standing places with maximum speed higher and long distance without standing places with maximum speed allowed and seats equipped with seat belts.
Like on a plane, says the expert.
The BESIP expert on road safety Jaroslav Ho<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>n does not find the underlying problem in the movement of the stewards on board the bus.
"During a quiet race there are not so many dangers, the situation can be compared to service on airplanes.
Even there it is not safe when turbulence comes and the flight attendant can bang his head.”
"If the bus brakes sharply, of course the laws of physics apply.
Same as in the city bus or on the tram.
The transport company must solve the safety of the stewards with an internal regulation," he says and also understands that, from the point of view of the law, the problem is not solved.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura is willing to suspend services.
Student Agency is the only transport company that offers the services of stewards.
This one takes about two hundred.
Even after the accident, the director did not consider their job dangerous.
“As soon as I have the feeling that I have to consider the profession of the steward as a dangerous job, I will abolish it.
Passengers can receive coffee and newspapers as they go up.
They would also cut costs,” he says.
The director of Asiana Alexej Litvin, which operates a fraction of the lines of the Student Agency, said the lack of stewards on its vehicles was an interest in safety.
"We don't have hostesses, we are opposed from the very beginning.
Sooner or later it will end in a fatal accident," said less than a year ago T<0xC3><0xBD>den.cz.
An immense tragedy has occurred.
A young stewardess from the Plze<0xC5><0x88> region, who had worked for the company for two years, died in the accident on the line to Naples.
A Slovenian truck probably exited the emergency lane without using the arrow and blocked the road to the bus.
The bus driver tried to avoid it with a sharp maneuver, but he hit him with the right front.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura rejects the fact that the two seats reserved for the Stewarts' rest had been occupied.
"It is not possible to reserve these seats on long-haul buses, they are unstoppable."
The company plans to report the driver of the truck.
The agency will not wait for the court’s ruling to pay damages to the girl’s family, but expects financial compensation from the culprit.
Revision of the law?
Not in sight
The revision of the law, on which a group of 30 experts from the Ministry of Transport has been working for more than a year, could lead to specifying the movement of stewarts on board buses.
“But they have not achieved any concrete results.
They don’t consider them as much as buses, they take care of the scoring system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of the mobile phone while driving,” says the expert Ho<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>n.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the Stewarts' activity as a major threat to the safety of passengers," said Havelka, who said that the control of bus safety is the responsibility of the police and security offices.
D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf hopes for Frankfurt
There is no shortage of words in the letter of the director of WestLB addressed to the collaborators of the house.
In the letter published on Monday that could form "the capital market center of the financial group of savings banks" through the meeting of the banking institution of D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf with the Deka-Bank of Frankfurt.
West LB would launch a "competent block" with lasting profits in such an undertaking.
Moreover, such a union could be a decisive push for further ties in the banking sector of the L<0xC3><0xA4>nder.
So it is read, when a board of directors in difficult times wants to demonstrate the ability to act.
Because the ailing WestLB is still under heavy pressure.
Not only on the part of the EU commission, but also through the national body for the financial supervision service, having pointed out some time ago to the regional government of North Rhine-Westphalia that time is running out in search of a future solution.
The links between Deka-Bank, which savings banks’ own clients already know because of their investment funds, and WestLB have certainly been talked about for quite some time, including by Frankfurt.
At the end of August, the head of Deka-Bank Franz Waas reported at the presentation of the turnover of the first half of the year that a merger of the house in via Mainz with a national bank such as Helaba or West LB does not make sense.
However, the board of directors of Deka, which is half-owned by regional banks and savings bank consortia, has delegated the board of directors to conduct talks with West LB on joint negotiations.
It could be market negotiations or parts of them.
But the conversation, as they say in the business square, has only just begun.
Deka-Bank, with its 3,000 employees, is one of the most important in Frankfurt’s business district and is not mentioned for the first time when it comes to consolidating the savings bank sector.
In 2003 it seemed for a short time that Deka-Bank could merge with the regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate and Helaba.
Nothing was done about this three-way association.
As soon as the plans were published, the regional bank of Hesse was opposed to Helaba's participation.
The remaining two institutions also proved unable to reach an agreement.
The regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate went instead to the regional bank of Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg in Stuttgart.
Yet they have always thought about it for a merger of Deka-Bank with regional banks.
But eventually G<0xC3><0xBC>nther Merl, chairman of Helaba’s board of directors, spoke out against design games to reunite with his house.
Apart from this, it seems that knowledge is being created, that it is necessary for the different houses of the public sector to approach each other.
Since the election of the Bavarian Parliament has passed, a meeting of the Bavarian Landesbank with Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg could take place first.
This is not good news for Helaba at all.
If the pressure for more mergers increases, the partners will be missing.
In the South there would now be the junior partner, although so far it has overcome the financial crisis much better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
The association of savings banks Hesse-Turingia, which participates with 85 percent of Helaba, has put the deadlock at the meeting with WestLB.
Only NordLB would remain.
These geo-strategic reasonings are just an account.
On the other hand, there is also the question of how the different business models of the individual houses fit together.
In June, Merl pointed out that the decisive question, by which business model the future of the regional banks would be assured, would not yet be answered by the association of German savings banks.
In the end, the division of West LB could also come out, which of course is not desired by that.
Thus the letter of the board of directors expresses the desire to aspire in any case to a "general solution".
You will see how the reunification of the individual parts with the Deka-Bank will work.
The second weekend of the beer festival is dedicated to Italians
For Elena it is the first time while for Luca it is the third or fourth time.
This time Elena is present at the party as a companion, and so she says that everything is different.
Behind them next to the 5l. barrel of the Kaiser brand stands a massive bearded and shows to the about 200 travelers what are the deep tones that it can produce from the throat.
Elena first gives Luca a pat and after a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here to the bus parking next to the Porta Nuova station, this evening depart at 23.45 four courier to Munich, Beer Festival, arrival scheduled at 6.30.
Three couriers are reserved especially for Italians, in another they travel only Brazilians.
In one corner of the parking lot the South Americans are singing with the flag in their hands, having already celebrated during the night.
It’s so loud, says Marco, that it’s not something for Italians.
Marco wearing a long coat with faux fur lining and a pair of glasses with wide silver slats belong to the buses.
They have been going to Oktoberfest for 5 years, this year there are 3 tours.
The night departure, during the day to the party, back at 10.30 p.m.
Staying overnight would only create unnecessary expenses, Marco says.
The cost of 45 Euros includes the trip, the welcome of the toast with the Kaiser beer, made according to the Bavarian rules of genuineness, the sickness fund and the German guide – Marco attended a German course in Frankfurt.
And so at night the buses leave for the Brenner.
There's no beer yet.
Suddenly silence falls on the bus, travelers sleep.
Better yet, they'll still need their strength.
They stop in Bressanone and Holzkirchen, where other buses with Italian plates on the A9 motorway before Munich take a short break.
When, as expected, Marco’s group arrives at 6.30 am at the parking lot near the Theresienwiese, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others regroup, Marco explains for the last time the attack program.
First, put on your yellow hat.
On the left it says "Oktoberfest" next to the internet address of Marco's travel agency: "Conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: "When they open the doors of the beer tent it means running!", quotes Marco early in the morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the seats at the bottom of the tent.
"Not forward, otherwise we block, and not all the yellow caps sitting on the same benches, divide into the adjacent space!"
The mug costs 8.25 Euro, screams Marco.
And don't forget to tip.
"Prove to the security service, that we behave well!
As soon as you leave the seats, they disappear!"
Third: "Tonight at 10.30 p.m. on time we meet here again!
He's already leaving for the party.
On the street one attacks as you follow away the yellow caps to the trees, to the road signs and even to an advertising billboard of a large Bavarian people's party.
You want to be ready to beat the retreat.
It is the second weekend of the festival, known as the "weekend of the Italians".
Exact data do not exist, we speak of 50 thousand, who leave to cross the Alps and invade the tents, it is claimed that 10% of visitors come specifically from Italy.
The police of Monaco is reinforced with 7 South Tyrolean agents, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which makes a statistic on nationalities, where Italians are in first place with 200 medical care in front of the British (about 60 medical care) and the Austrians (about 80).
Especially loved by Italians is the marquee of the Hofbr<0xC3><0xA4>uhaus.
1. Sleepless nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors
The German banking system is relatively stable, Finance Minister Peer Steinbr<0xC3><0xBC>ck confirmed last week.
It is good that the politician used the word "relative" and also mentioned, that the German banking sector is not spared from critical developments.
Because the crisis started on the weekend.
The real estate lender Hypo Real Estate, noted in the DAX, obtains from a consortium of German banks a billion-dollar loan, in order to protect itself from turbulence in the markets.
An expert on the situation told Reuters on Monday, the support credits would reach up to 35 billion euros.
The Hypo Real Estate only has to pay the interest for the requested part.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
At the bottom are the losses of the affiliate Depfa.
The state funder according to a newspaper article refinanced itself in the very short term – which is no longer possible due to mistrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008 the bank’s reserves had fallen by 95% on 2.37 million euros, also the share of equity fell from 1.6 to 1.45.
Current income and net income from financial affairs had fallen to 0 compared to last year, profits from increases in both demand and certain shares as well as the liquidation of provisions in credits fell by more than 70% on 5 million euros.
Only thanks to higher incomes from the return of subordinate compensation costs that come both from the restructuring of the former Depfa group and from the repayment of interest according to the single text of the tax laws and from the management of business for business consortia, the negative profit was quite moderate with about 16%.
The former public lender after being privatized in 1990 was lost in speculation with commercial real estate loans, which were spun off into the Aareal Bank.
Since the income in the classic state financing was too low, DEPFA has engaged more in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint projects of private and state investors (PPP) and has diversified internationally.
The Hypo Real Estate must now amortize the value of the affiliate, which will have a fundamental material effect on the profit and loss account of the group.
The fact is that the dividends have been cancelled.
In 2007 they were reduced by 2/3.
The Hypo Real Estate after the absorption of Depfa is an important financier of the State and infrastructure.
It is more dependent on market refinancing among banks compared to other institutions, because it does not have client trust deposits.
Due to the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, lending among banks has largely dried up, because banks accumulate liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate annually needs for a part of the credit portfolio of the Depfa – about 50 billion. – in the short term the means of refinancing.
According to the notice of the Hypo Real Estate the financial needs of the group were covered by the credit for a certain period and the enterprise protected from the influence of the international money markets mostly not working.
From other sources, it is felt that thanks to the money, the refinancing is guaranteed until the end of 2009.
The chairman of the HRE steering committee Georg Funke on the contrary said that the HRE group will not need money markets anytime soon.
The Bundesbank and the National Authority for Financial Supervision (BaFin) rely on the fact that the marketability of the HRE group is still assured.
This is hoped for by the bank’s shareholders and creditors.
In view of the dynamics and imponderability of the crisis there will be no guarantee.
The funding may not be fully utilized.
But even the opposite is not to be excluded.
After Sunday night the bank learned that it was about to fail, the momentary rescue failed to calm the spirits.
The share price fell by 75% on 3.30 Euro.
They hold up mortgage courses pretty well.
While the debts of the previous degree are almost immovable, they give up the courses of deferred credits.
The mortgages of the subsidiary W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-Hypo are particularly affected, as are the maturities with maturities beyond 2009.
Before the mortgages of the HRE seemed an alternative speculative investment, now their value must, after the strengthening of the crisis of the banks and of the institution itself, that with the relief of the Depfa has happened the crisis, will have to be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
As long as central banks, governments and less damaged banks are still ready, you can count on an amortization of annuities within the term.
Or it goes into operation, which nobody dares to hope – that the financial crisis will be overcome within the next 15 months.
But concerning the information overturned because of the partial statizations the almost certain probability has become a justified hope.
It will mostly create long-term investors some sleepless nights with the decision whether to part with their commitments.
Short-term investors can carry forward losses for future payments of the capital gains tax.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento-Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, on her first day of school is supposed to show up at Tachibana Highschool, the girls start giggling: The German is completely “kawaii”!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word already from Mangas-in the new Exchange Log tells of Japan.
The first day of school in Japan
How excited I was.
I also had fifa to go to school.
I live on the edge of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and I need 40 minutes by train to get to Tachibana Highschool.
I had to find my own way and luckily I didn’t get lost.
The beginning of the first hour of class does not seem to have been fixed as well as we have in Lower Saxony.
The students arrive slowly from 8 am onwards, until at 8.40 am begins a short interview with the professor, the so-called "home room".
But before class started, it was my turn to introduce myself.
I'm not the kind of guy who talks in front of people, plus in front of a class of 40 schoolchildren.
Since I didn’t have the school uniform yet, I donned an old skirt from the host mother, along with a shirt, blue socks and black leather shoes.
Dressed like this, I sat down in front of the chair and tried to pronounce well: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..."- my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and I celebrate my birthday in a week.
At that time I was very happy to have already started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class whispered, giggled and waved and I kept hearing the word “Kawaii.”
I already knew this from my Mangas.
It belongs to the essential lexicon of Japanese girls to survive and means "cute, sweet".
Then I rushed to my place.
The girl next to me grinned, for her it was an honor to sit next to an exchange student
The rest of the class had gone on quietly, but when she played the gong, I was assailed in the true sense of the word.
Everything was messy talk and giggling and bothering me with questions – then it’s really hard to understand Japanese English.
In the pause everyone opened their Bento.
My host mother also made me the basket for the Lunch - it's different from the boring German sandwiches.
I had risotto with spices, sausages, cucumber and seaweed salad, fruit and a kind of rolls with meat and tofu ..
I don’t even know what I eat in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely new.
Fact is, everything is really good.
Except maybe the salted prunes, brrr!
Bento is not just lunch at Japanese schools.
It happens sometimes that a girl gives a self-made Bento, prepared quite artistically, with the hope of then getting to know the boy during the recreation.
I've read it in my Manga comics.
I'm really curious, if I can find out.
"Why Japan?" my friends asked me when I told them that I would like to go to school in Japan for a year.
I've always said:
"Because it fascinates me"
I have been reading manga for years.
And to better understand the comics and the culture they contain, sooner or later I started to learn a bit of the Japanese language.
I was completely convinced that I was going there once.
I am also fascinated by tradition, customs and customs.
They care a lot about us here.
On the one hand Japan is a place of technology and the latest trends - on the other hand: strict, disciplined and traditional.
Since everything is organized well, I never felt lost, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I have ever seen in my life.”
1. Even rats have feelings
A rat or a cockroach flees when they feel danger. Does that mean they also feel fear?
Neuroscientist Joseph Le Doux is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
4. But how could it be verified if, when they behave in the same way as us, they have the same feelings as us?
Articles by well-known scientists have been published in the Internet newspaper "Edge" for some years.
6. SPIEGEL ONLINE in a series presents chosen answers to the question: "What do you think is true, without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings or other states of consciousness, without me or anyone else having so far been able to prove it, since we cannot even prove that other men have consciousness.
But in this case we must at least hope, that all human brains have the same basic configuration.
9. As soon as we turn to the other species and ask questions about feeling or about consciousness in general, we enter into impractical territory, because the base of reference does not match.
When a rat is in a dangerous situation, it does the same things that other animals do. That is, it pretends to be dead, runs away or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, from which some scientists understand that there is a comparable subjective feeling.
I don't believe that.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult for us to convey our feelings toward animals.
On the one hand, the lateral prefrontal cortex is often connected with human awareness, the associated circuits (this is due to its direct participation in short memory and executive and control functions).
In man this large area is much more developed than in other primates and it seems that among other creatures it is completely missing.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness dependent on the prefrontal cortex, including knowledge, who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, we thus admit the foundation on the assumption that man differs even from other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity should occur in the way of speaking of man: since a large part of life is connected to language, it is often said to be linked to consciousness.
In this case, the animals could be excluded.
Although awareness does not depend on language, it would influence it so that the awareness of the animal, as it is made, surely differs greatly from the circumstances of our consciousness.
This is why it is difficult to discover how consciousness can be seen in other animals.
If it is not possible to measure it as an internal and subjective thing, in analyzing it through one's own experience because of the special hardware, their research will pose us great problems.
Most interpretations refer to the content of conscious experience, but apart from this there is another aspect of consciousness that science would find easier to access.
One could analyze the consciousness processes of animals without regard to their contents, and this is precisely what happens in studies on the short memory of primates, in particular the example of visualization.
So for this principle, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick follow, we pass first to the neural correlates of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: both could be identical but not necessarily.
Interestingly this principle also highlights the value of the prefrontal cortex for the implementation of visualization.
What then is delineated for feelings?
I impute them to the fact that an emotional system such as that of fear is activated in one of its conscious activities of the brain.
What we refer to as “fear” is therefore the state of mind in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as the reactions of the body) occupies the working memory.
Seen in this way, the feelings are closely related to the regions of the cortex, which characterize the primates and in particular the human being.
With the speaking nature subtle nuances of feeling are created, because with the help of words and grammar we can distinguish and categorize situations, to describe them to others.
Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that the feelings result from more primitive activities of the body's regions of sensation of the cortex and the paleocephalus, similar to Jack Pankseep, who however focused more on the paleocephalus.
Since this web has not changed much in the course of human evolution, this could absolutely be part of the extended feelings of the species.
On a purely theoretical level, I cannot contradict it, but I consider it indemonstrable.
Pankseep argues that what appears to rats and humans as fear is likely to be felt with the senses in both cases: but how could it be, if rats and humans feel the same thing when they behave similarly?
A cockroach in case of danger flees as if he too felt fear?
In my eyes the mere similarity of behavior cannot yet demonstrate any vital similarity.
That is, the neural comparison continues to help: rats and humans have similar paleoencephalons, cockroaches not even a brain.
But is the paleoencephalon responsible for feelings?
And even if you could prove it for humans, how would you prove it for rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even insects (who knows?), have feelings.
But I didn't know how to prove it.
And since their feelings are fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on specific circuits and language), I prefer to study the emotional behavior rather than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, here there is progress at the neural level, as long as you give up the same procedure on rats and men.
Just as I don’t do research on language and consciousness in rats, so I don’t do research on their emotions, I don’t even know if they exist.
This can be considered short-sighted, but I prefer to take steps forward, rather than crashing continuously against a wall.
They are, in fact, an emotional practice.
UEFA President Platini: Poland and Ukraine postponed
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik said the preparations will soon be put under the direct responsibility of the president and prime minister.
"The government sees UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as a demonstration of confidence in Ukraine and in its ability to organise the Europeans with Poland," Wasjunik said.
“This is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still a lot to do in both countries.”
Both host countries limp on the roadmap for building or rebuilding stadiums, roads, hotels and airports.
Eventually, the number of stadiums to be used for the Europeans will even be reduced from eight to six.
“We can’t waste any more time.
Now we have to work with maximum speed," said the president of the Ukrainian association Grigoriy Surkis.
"UEFA will keep an eye on us constantly."
An even more radical step was taken in Poland.
After numerous scandals the leadership of the Polish association PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee and replaced with the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be "the serious danger that the PZPN is not able to operate according to the rules," Drzewiecki told Poland's PAP news agency.
"In a letter we have assured UEFA President Michel Platini that preparation for the 2012 European Championships will not suffer."
Many members of the first division were only convicted of manipulation last season, in the end it was even necessary to postpone the start of the League at the last moment.
Dennis Quaid responds indignantly
He wanted to promote a new film, in an interview he talked about the private and now he has a crush on the ex: the Hollywood star Meg Ryan has declared his ex Dennis Quaid adulterous.
He foams with anger and retorts.
The Roses' delayed war for ex-husband Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their separation, the two Hollywood actors are now fighting with each other in a nasty fight - in public.
Meg Ryan in an interview with American magazine InStyle last week for the first time spoke about the reasons for the marriage failure: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and this has been very painful."
The extent of the betrayals she would come to know only after the separation.
The occasion for the “soul stripper” was working with Ryan’s press for her new film “The Women” – it tells the story of an adultery.
Dennis Quaid’s reaction to being publicly declared an adulterous husband was clear: it would be “unheard of,” the 54-year-old told the New York Daily News, for “Meg to repeat and rework the story of our relationship for the umpteenth time.”
It would also be "deplorable" that Jack, the 16-year-old son they had together, would again "be publicly reminded of the pain and subversion that a separation means for every child."
While Ryan has been living alone since the breakup, Quaid is married again and will soon become the father of twins.
And therefore his judgments close with the arrow: "My life in any case goes on.
I consider myself lucky to have a wonderful family that does everything for the best."
Prices for airline tickets and hotels fall
In the first half of 2008 flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would be up to 50% cheaper.
Flights and overnight stays at the hotel have again become more convenient - this is the result of a study by the financial and travel provider American Express.
The company analyzed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and after a price increase in the first quarter it observed a noticeable decline in the second quarter.
After hotel market prices have been rising for years, overnight stays in many places have already dropped in price.
From January to March prices rose in 41 of the 48 European cities still examined on average around 6.9 compared to 2007
However, from April to June prices were already 3.6% lower than the previous year.
The most noticeable trend would have been in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
American Express sees this as the reason for the weak dollar price, which would have led to a "warm desire to travel of American tourists"
Financial centres such as Frankfurt and London would also be affected by the recession in hotel prices more strongly than industrial centres such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city hotel prices with an increase of 26.3% even hold the record in Europe
Also with regard to flight prices, the trend in the first quarter still marks up:
Due to the increase in the price of kerosene, passengers in Economy Class had to pay an average of 7.1% compared to 2007, long-haul fuel-intensive flights would be up to 29.2% more expensive
From April to June, the prices of Economy Class airline tickets fell by an average of 12.5% compared to the previous quarter, in the first class and in the Business the price changes were however much weaker.
In Germany, prices have fallen even more sharply than in other European countries:
From January to March prices rose by 11,9 %, in the second quarter they fell by 23,6 %.
As for domestic German flights, according to the study, prices have even halved.
The reason for the collapse in prices would be, on the one hand, the downward economic growth, the company explains.
Demand in many segments of the air travel market has crumbled.
On the other hand there would be because of the agreement on open skies, which liberalizes air traffic between the US and Europe, an increased pressure of competition.
A sign of the critical situation would be the suppression of unprofitable routes at Airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 would have declared bankruptcy – only in Europe were 24 airlines.
HSV beat Gladbach 1-0
With a goal and simple methods the SV Hamburg becomes the leader.
At Borussia Luhukay he still can’t find a group of 11 that works.
Here Kristoffer Klein worsens the makeshift landing for national team player Marko Marin.
The Gladbach player entered the game late and failed with a shot on the crossbar.
His message was formulated precisely, it passed on his lips in a convincing way.
He knew he was absolutely right.
“We need the second goal,” Hermann Rieger exclaimed in the hallway of the Hamburg Arena booths.
Not much had happened in the catacombs, the game break was over and most of them sat back in their seats.
Rieger has been an HSV physiotherapist for almost 3 decades, enjoying an even greater esteem than some old players.
And so his warning found even listening in the high spheres.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and raised his thumb in approval.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg head coach Martin Jol.
His order must have sounded similar: here is the second goal!
The change of position did not occur.
“Not everything here today was nice to see,” Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt would have also "wanted more relaxed".
For a 1-0 draw, Hamburg have to thank Mladen Petric (11) for his header and the fact that many of Gladbach's weak players could not hurt Hamburg's weak players.
“It was a dirty victory,” Martin Jol summed up.
The SV Hamburg on Monday will be 121 years old.
Spectators celebrated earlier, on Saturday afternoon, themselves, the blue sky on the arena and the flashing ranking on the video screen, which legitimized their sports club as before the class.
It will be a birthday without a real party.
“We are able to put everything in place,” Marcell Jansen said.
He has the feeling that the provisional table certificate is more indicative of the unpredictability of the championship than of the dominance of his HSV.
The team with its late arrivals – Brazil’s Neves und Silva, goalkeeper Petric and FC Bayern’s Jansen – is slowly finding itself, but has yet to shine.
“We need more atmosphere and more dribbling,” Jol said.
After the defeat of the vote
Fear is circulating on Wall Street.
The first news of the failure of the rescue package caused the Dow Jones to temporarily collapse by 700 points.
This was the biggest loss of points in the one-day space of its history.
Later the Down recovered again a bit.
At around 20:30, the most important stock exchange barometer in the world listed/recovered with a good 5% shortfall on 10,579 payers.
The Nasdaq Technology Exchange held steady with a deficit of more than 7% on 1548 points.
The biggest loser at the time was the Dow American Express, which put us back just 14%, and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12%.
No title could do it.
Goldman Sachs shares fell just 10 percent.
Only a few days earlier the great investor Warren Buffett had taken part in the enterprise.
As part of the rescue plan, financial funds were to be allocated for the hoarding of so-called mortgage documents.
The sum must be paid, however, not in a stroke, but in degrees.
On the other hand, the State had to maintain the Aktienoptionsscheine of the financial companies, which could be redeemed with an adequate trend of the quotations, in order to reduce the charge for the State coffers.
The course of actions in Europe and the USA in the downward vortex
Billions in aid for banks in Europe and the US do not erase investors’ doubts.
The stock price of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate plummets and tears the German stock market index down
The U.S. Dow Jones index is holding us back despite the planned rescue of the financial market through the state.
Spectacular loss of the course of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have pulled the index of the German stock exchange into deep deficit.
The shares of the real estate lender of Monaco have lost despite the rescue action of the federal government and private banks temporarily 3 quarters of their value, the Commercial Bank has ceded more than 20%.
The German DAX index slipped sharply below the psychologically important 6000 points and is quoted with a deficit of 3.7% on 5,839 points.
Global stock markets are falling to their knees.
In New York Wall Street opened with a clear deficit.
Investors have been concerned that the U.S. government’s $700 billion rescue package may not be enough to boost financial markets.
The Dow lost 334 points or 3.3% of 10,809.25 points in the first hour of trading.
The US House of Representatives wanted to vote on the bailout, the vote in the Senate could follow the first of October.
Even the other European stock exchanges could only one direction: in London for the moment the FTSE index has fallen by 3.2%, the CAC 40 in Paris has lost 2.9%.

Dark matter affects the flight of space probes
For years a mysterious phenomenon has puzzled scientists: dark matter affects the speed of space probes during the so-called Swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity may not be entirely accurate.
The Ulysses spacecraft has been flying through space for almost 18 years.
Due to the fast-freezing fuel pipes, death by freezing now hangs over her.
Among scientists for years a mysterious phenomenon creates havoc – the anomaly of / or Swing-by
The Swing-by is a flight maneuver of space probes, with which they obtain additional momentum / thrust / oscillation in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example of the Earth.
So the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The Euro-American Cassini-Huygens research probe used this physical device as well as the Ulysses solar probe.
What has surprised scholars for years: rockets do not behave completely as one would expect according to the law of gravitation.
In fact, there are irregularities in the speed.
Probes suddenly become faster or slower.
So far physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
The year renamed the anomaly Swing-by.
Some experts fear that perhaps even Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity, which describes the attractive force of matter with a curvature of space, may not be entirely accurate.
American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton firmly believes as before that Einstein was not wrong, and tries to explain the anomaly of the Swing-by by means of the so-called dark matter that astronomers have spotted in the cosmos.
"Responsible for the anomaly could be dark matter that could also be very close to Earth," he writes.
Space scientists have only known about the existence of dark matter for about 10 years.
A force of attraction evidently emanates from her, the effect of which on the other heavenly bodies is evident.
It itself is instead completely invisible, that is, it does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation whatsoever, especially no visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, dark matter makes up at least a good fifth of the entire mass of the cosmos.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After 10 days in the hands of their kidnappers the kidnapped tourists in Egypt would be free again, as confirmed by the Italian foreign minister.
The kidnappers from Sudan had demanded several million euros in ransom.
In a pre-release shootout, six abductors are reported to have been killed.
Five Germans were kidnapped in southern Egypt.
Negotiations for the ransom are already underway.
The Germans are always in the crosshairs of the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are undoubtedly free.
This was reported by the Egyptian state television, the Arab broadcaster Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the news of the Italian broadcaster Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been released.
We are looking at their state of health," Frattini said.
The 5 Germans, 5 Italians and one Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian companions would be in good health and safe, Egyptian state television reported.
The 19 members of a desert expedition are already on their way to Cairo.
The background of a shooting that took place before the hostages were released remains unclear: therefore the kidnappers after the instructions of an Egyptian public security agent would have been ready for the conclusion of the kidnapping, before the Sudanese army killed 6 of them by surprise.
“The problem had been solved.
They agreed to a ransom,” the official said.
It would have been "still only a matter of taking the hostages", when suddenly "this surprise" arrived.
Sudanese soldiers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt had shot dead 6 of the kidnappers and captured 2 of them.
The kidnappers had demanded from Germany a ransom in the amount of 6 million euros; the money would have to be delivered by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported in reference to a German intermediary, the release of the hostages would be delayed, because the kidnappers feared for their own safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers wanted to release the women hostages after the payment of the ransom.
The men were to be held until the kidnappers had a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the report.
Father-in-law's abuse 'led to suicide'
Years of abuse by her stepfather led a woman to kill herself, a court said.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians, Cornwall, was in prison for 6 years after admitting eight cases of sexual assault.
The Truro Crown Court learned that he regularly molested his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle, when she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession note, "I feel responsible for his death."
The court heard that Miss Randle had killed herself at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on 1 April 2007, at the age of 34.
When she was a child and lived in Coventry, Trerise molested and blindfolded her before having sex, while her mother was out working in a pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
But the court learned that Ms. Randle, who had spent a lot of time volunteering at the National Trust, was tormented by the abuse they had caused her.
In 2006, Attorney General Ramsey Quaife told the court that friends of Ms. Randle, who had been a very good surfer and cyclist, had "emotionally died", and that she had "given up with life".
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in his Plymouth apartment.
She is believed to have killed herself by suffocating with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle comforted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a letter of confession that ended: "I bound and bandaged her."
"I didn't molest her sexually.
I feel responsible for his death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "You are an extremely strange fetishist, and for your victim it must have been terrifying, especially when he was only seven years old.
"This unpleasant saga ends with the victim taking his own life.
Even harder is the fact that if he had not done so, it would have been difficult for the facts to have ended up in court.”
I notice the effects that Stephanie’s father and mother describe having had on their daughter in these years.
"Otherwise it was clearly probable that she had been a promising and happy young woman of success."
The officer who lost the data will be punished.
The Cabinet Office official who left top-secret documents on a train in June is to be charged under the Official Secrets Act, the BBC has learned.
The man was on a trip from the Ministry of Defence when he left two highly classified documents on the train to Waterloo.
The documents were passed on to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
It is the least sensitive of the charges made under this law and there is nothing to suggest criminal intent.
BBC defence correspondent Frank Gardner said the move would come as a surprise to many in the administration.
“They will have thought this was being handled internally at the Mod and the Cabinet Office,” he said.
The employee, who cannot be named, is about to be charged under section 8.1 of the act, the clause concerning the safeguarding of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service recommended that the officer be charged by the Metropolitan Police because of the highly sensitive nature of his work.
The documents he lost contained assessments of al-Qaaeda and the capabilities of Iraq's security forces.
He was informed of the decision Monday morning and was taken away from his home and taken to a hidden location.
Construction companies face the account of B&B
British construction companies could face an account of more than <0xC2><0xA3>80,000 after the Bradford & Bingley bank bailout.
The government has given <0xC2><0xA3>14bn to protect the deposits of 2.6 million savers at Bradford & Bingley.
The interest on that loan will be paid by all companies taking money from savers, including the 59 construction companies.
Building Societies Association (BSA) director general Adrian Coles said it was “irritating” that companies and their members had to pay.
The <0xC2><0xA3>14bn loan will eventually be repaid when the Bradford & Bingley mortgages are redeemed.
But the interest that will accrue in the meantime will be charged annually to the 700 financial companies that take deposits. But the interest that will accrue in the meantime will be charged annually to the 700 financial companies that accept deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies would be included in that number.
It is irritating that those institutions that have behaved prudently ... are now called upon to pay part of the bill of those institutions that have been much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company had to pay in proportion to the deposits it had, and that the companies between them had to pay 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will amount to <0xC2><0xA3>450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find <0xC2><0xA3>81 million to pay the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, general manager of the association of construction companies, told the BBC that he believes it is unfair.
“It is irritating that those institutions that have behaved prudently in the recovering housing market are now being asked to pay part of the bill for those institutions that have been much less prudent.”
According to the BSA, no company has failed since documentation began in 1945.
"We need to look at all aspects in the coming weeks to see what options there are to protect construction companies and their members from what could be a significant bill," Mr Cole added.
Interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010 the interest of a whole year will be due and this could be almost twice as high.
Since construction companies are mutual organizations without shareholders, their members end up paying the bill through higher fees or lower interest rates on savings accounts.
Milk rises to 5 pence per litre
People in Jersey are facing the fact that they have to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that there will be an increase in the wholesale prices of its milk for an extra five pence per liter from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-penny increase in February, and comes after a search conducted by a consulting company.
Retailers have to decide for themselves whether they want to offload the price increase on their customers.
(DANILO) Before the February increase, the wholesale price last changed in 2002.
Ex-Prime Minister of Bangladesh Denied Bail
A Bangladeshi court has rejected a bail request from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, meaning she could be arrested when she returns to the country.
Her lawyers said the court refused to grant her bail for extorting 50 million taka ($729,700) from a businessman when he was a member of parliament.
The case is one of many corruption charges hanging over her.
Sheikh Hasina's longtime political rival, Khaleda Zia, had been released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina’s return to Bangladesh is expected in the coming weeks but his party, Awami League, has demanded that the military-backed country’s temporary government give her full freedom first.
Correspondents say that while she was going abroad for medical treatment on the word, it is not clear under the terms of her release whether she will be able to remain at large when she returns to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say he will appeal to the Supreme Court against the High Court order.
“The high court refused the bail request for Sheikh Hasina on the grounds that she cannot have bail since she is already abroad on parole for medical care,” says her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will file or appeal against the High Court order."
His lawyers explain that he needs bail to return to the country from abroad to prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after Oct. 17, a senior leader of the Awami League party said on Sunday.
She was detained last year after the military-backed government took power, but was released in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all allegations against themselves.
Fear of Afghan anti-polio campaign
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan are missing from the recent immunization campaign due to Taliban-related violence, the UN says.
The UN carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces last week.
But it is said to be unable to reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
A U.N. spokesman said this happened despite promises by the Taliban that they would not attack or hinder thousands of staff carrying the vaccinations.
BSkyB loses legal battle with ITV
BSkyB lost its legal battle with the Competition Commission’s decision to force the company to reduce its stake in rival television station ITV.
BSkyB has been told by the competition’s appellate court to cut its shares in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
Previously, the commission had said that BSkyB's participation hindered competition and allowed unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought the stake in 2006 in a deal that effectively blocked NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading reported that the acquisition of BSkyB's stake in ITV cast doubt on ITV's independence, prompting the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
Virgin's head, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and Ofcom's regulator opposed the purchase.
BSkyB argued that forcing it to reduce its ITV stake was unreasonable and a disproportionate remedy - particularly as BSkyB had said it would surrender its voting rights.
New investigation into U.S. prosecutor's case
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special Public Prosecutor to examine the firing of nine American lawyers in 2006.
The operation took place when a report on the case by the Inspector General of the Department of Justice criticized the actions of administrative officers.
The report was critical of the White House, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was sparked by fears that prosecutors had been removed for political reasons.
Special prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officials questioned during the investigation lied to investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice.
“Serious allegations concerning potentially criminal behavior have not been fully investigated or verified,” said Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
The assignment of a special prosecutor with the power to compel witnesses to testify was one of the main recommendations.
The dispute began when nine U.S. prosecutors were removed from their positions by the Justice Department in December 2006.
At the time, the department said lawyers had been fired for poor performance.
But it later emerged that the dismissed lawyers had not been rated worse than many other colleagues, leading many observers to conclude that the dismissal had been politically motivated.
Some of the prosecutors had been involved in the prosecution of high-profile Republican members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate allegations of fraud against Democratic voters.
U.S. prosecutors investigate and pursue cases in court on behalf of the government.
They can be fired at any time, but they cannot be fired for political reasons.
The then head of the Justice Department, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, found himself in the storm for layoffs, and eventually resigned his position.
A number of other Justice Department officials resigned.
(The Inspector General’s report was very critical of Mr. Gonzales’ role in the case, saying that he bore primary responsibility for the layoffs, that he had abdicated his leadership role and had been extraordinarily detached during the trial.
Other officials, including former senior Bush aide Karl Rove, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
The epic Meat Loaf will be celebrated
Rock star Meat Loaf is about to be honored at the Q Awards for her epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will withdraw his special gold award at next week’s ceremony in London, said he was “honored” to earn the accolade.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the hit track on Meat Loaf's 1977 album.
Coldplay will lead nominations for this year’s awards, being on the list of nominees in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that transcend things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is undoubtedly one of those."
The song, composed by Jim Steinman, required strong vocals that were provided by Meat Loaf.
It opened with an instrumental section that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was released as a single in the UK in 1979 and peaked at number fifteen.
But Meat Loaf's Bat Out Of Hell album spent nearly nine years on the charts and went on to sell more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf – real name Marvin Lee Aday – has suffered from health problems in recent years, including surgery for an irregular heartbeat in 2003 after collapsing on stage.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
It later emerged that he had a cyst on a vocal cord.
Dark city streets, often forgotten and perhaps soon on sale
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other sleepers, some famous, others merely of use.
But even many veteran taxi drivers and long-time residents find it difficult to give the location of Extra Place, mostly because they have never heard of it.
The tiny road is in the East Village and goes north from First Street – without doing Second Street – between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, it looks more like a dusty alley than an active busy street.
There are no road signs.
It is virtually impossible to see it on a normal atlas.
The road must, however, have admirers.
For example, there’s Avalon Bay, the real estate company of newly built luxury buildings on First Street.
You want to reopen Extra Place and create a cleaner passage for shops and boutiques that should open in the new buildings.
Other admirers include longtime neighbors who say they were struck by the truncated road simply because it was one of the last remnants of the stately neighborhood of the past.
But the city’s preservation and development department, which has control of the roads, has no interest in keeping it.
During a meeting of the land use committee of the district municipal commission some representatives of the city agency and Avalon Bay outlined a proposal for the real estate company to buy the roads.
But the committee prefers the street to remain in the city’s hands, and has asked for a new plan to be presented next month, says Susan Stetzer, the district director of the Community Board 3.
“There is very little space left to the city property, and we would like the city to continue to own Extra Place,” he said.
“There could be proposals to fix and manage it, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want to ensure public access.”
Avalon Bay many months ago announced plans to reopen the small street and install seating, including some to be used for a cafe to which the real estate company hopes to rent the space.
The idea that Avalon Bay would buy the road was first made public at this month’s meeting.
Michele de Milly, a spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that while the company wants to use the road, it doesn’t necessarily mean it wants to own it.
“Avalon Bay’s main concern is to renovate this derelict alley and turn it into a public amenity,” he said, adding that the city has suggested the sale.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for Preservation Housing, said it was in fact the city’s desire to sell the road and noted that the agency’s purpose was to develop the property rather than administer it.
In comparison to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a slight historical imprint.
Some believe that it took its name in 1802, when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was divided among his many sons and the narrow strip of land was not claimed.
The back door of CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened on Extra Place, and the street is perhaps best known as the set for the cover photo of the Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia."
“The terrain was beautiful,” said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who took the picture in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, shreds of clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves, ropes."
Some residents, including some bloggers who write about “gentrification” of the East Village, opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that the piece of public property, modest as it is, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rarity – a fragment of almost unchanged city that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who has a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled, "The Book of Lamentations: A Little Nostalgic Look at the Endangered City"), published part of a Discourse on the City's History that appeared in The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow dead-end alleyway, dark even by day and bounded by rusty iron warehouse doors and shuttered windows, with week-old newspapers fluttering along the slums."
With few exceptions, the road looked almost the same as a recent evening.
A rat ran nimbly through the back of the road near a door leading into the CBGB, which is now the site of an aristocratic clothing store.
On the walls were graffiti and a 22-ounce empty bottle of beer lying next to a group of fresh, abandoned newspapers.
Few passers-by said they rarely thought of Extra Place but suggest it would need to be a bit embellished.
Mr. Fields, for his part, said he also thinks some people underestimate the attraction of the road in its current state.
“The best years of my life,” he said, “were in black, dirty, disgusting places.”
The bilingual debate: immersion in English
In this episode of Educational Look, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the candidates’ position on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, senior fellow in California studies and the senior director of educational studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book “Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs to Choose a School.”
Attracting Hispanic voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama’s educational projects are a significant example.
Mr. Obama’s campaign notes that, “African-American and Latino students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students,” which is true.
To combat these shortfalls in achieving goals, Obama’s education plan specifically supports, among other things, “transient bilingual education” for English learners.
Yet the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes classroom teaching of languages other than English, takes into account his interest in bridging the learning gaps.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
The students at the school are mostly Hispanic and low-income.
More than a third of students, many of whom have recently arrived, are studying English.
But, among fourth graders, an astonishing 100 percent of students took the top-level test in the 2008 math state exam.
An equally surprising 93 percent of fourth graders took the art-of-language-English expert level test.
This incredible achievement was achieved using a different ingredient than Mr. Obama’s preferred one.
Sixth Street emphasizes review and exercise, constant assessment of skills, and a “no excuses” attitude.
Also, and this is where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, director of Sixth Street, the school’s obstructive approach to English students is “full immersion.”
The use of English emphasizes the almost exclusive use of English in the context of education.
Mrs. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, told me, "We had a fantastic success with a student who just came from Mexico and if you had entered the class 12 months later you would not have been able to identify what it was."
"It works," he observed, "for us it works."
Would Obama model a school like Sixth Street Prep to replicate it in other Hispanic-majority schools and with English learners?
The results achieved by the school make the answer to that question very easy, but education policy in his own party (the National Education Associations is a long-time supporter of bilingual education) and his own continued support for bilingual education prevent him from predicting Mr. Obama’s answer.
While he agrees that immigrants should study English, Obama recently made the topic trivial when he said that people should stop worrying about “English-only” legislation.
Instead, he said, “you have to make sure that your children are able to speak Spanish.”
If Obama really wants to close these achievement gaps, he should carefully consider the educational models that work rather than despise or trivialize them.
Oil falls sharply and renews economic fear
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday because of concerns that even the U.S. bailout for financial markets may not be able to lift the economy.
Crude futures fell 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel at the New York Mercantile Exchange in the morning trading.
Prices have lost more than $20 a barrel since last Monday.
In the past two weeks, commodity markets have been rocked by Wall Street financial turmoil, and by a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After peaking at $145.26 a barrel in June, prices had plummeted to nearly $90 a barrel earlier this month, before rising again, against the backdrop of tremendous uncertainty in financial markets.
The anxiety affected investors again on Monday even after congressional leaders said they had reached an agreement over the weekend about the bailout, the largest in history.
The news was overshadowed by fresh concerns that the financial crisis was far from over.
In the latest episode of the progressive merger, Citigroup will buy the banking operations of Wachovia Corporation, the government said on Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said the hectic trading over the weekend had led to a rescue deal "seem to have failed to rekindle market sentiment.
As the economic situation worsens, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to ease.
“The outlook for global equity, interest rates and foreign exchange markets has become uncertain,” Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
“We believe that raw materials will not be able to escape contagion.
From a raw materials perspective our most pressing concern is to what extent the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China.”
Bank analysts have lowered their expectations for next year while home oil consumption due to slowing economic growth, reducing forecasts on the price of oil and gas by about 20 percent for 2009.
The exploit in the second quarter sets a team record.
After spending more time than anyone in the Jets uniform for the past eight or more seasons, defenseman Shaun Ellis thought he had seen it all.
Then he watched the second quarter unfold on Sunday, when the Jets turned a pointless game into a comeback.
"Never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals had equaled the grayness of the menacing clouds above them with a sluggish game.
Then quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, providing the perfect cue for an afternoon when their growing tuning took a giant step forward.
Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns in the fourth, including one when a cornerback fell and another with 10 seconds left at the end of the first half.
"I haven't gone out of my way," Favre said of all the passes that came to Coles.
He's a fantastic player.
Our communication has been great, despite what people may think."
As Favre and Coles played catch games, the defense hit Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner hard.
Cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a stray pitch and raised it for 32 yards in a touchdown.
Security Eric Smith made another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens forced a fumble from Warner.
The last turnover, the fumble forced by Bowens, may have been the most notable.
The Cardinals took the lead on that possession with 10 seconds left, and after the Jets got the ball back with 10 minutes left, Jay Feely kicked a 20-yard goal, for a 34-0 lead.
That was more than the Jets ever scored in a quarter.
When asked to describe the craziness, Jets coach Eric Mangini said, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
When he was told both — the Jets conceded 21 unanswered points in the third quarter — Mangini said, “I can tell you I liked the second quarter a lot more than the third.”
There were a lot of points in a small amount of time.”
Rested Gebrselassie breaks her world record
Ethiopia’s Haile Gebrselassie showed again why many consider him the best marathoner ever, breaking his own world record at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person to run a 26.2 mile run under 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a victory on the race favorably flat in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie shatters for 27 seconds his previous score of 2:03:26, run last year in Berlin.
At 35, Gebrselassie sets the 26th world record for a career so stunning that it has produced a world championship or world record at every distance from the metric mile to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie skipped the Beijing Olympic marathon, fearing — perhaps too alarmingly, in retrospect — that air pollution would worsen his asthma problems.
Instead, he decided to run in Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees on departure, 55 degrees on arrival - Gebrselassie won Sunday with a scorching average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
As soon as half-backs like Kenya’s Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat went the long distance, the marathon record fell by more than two minutes in the past decade, since Ronaldo from the Coast of Brazil won in Berlin in 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday’s win, Gebrselassie told reporters that two weeks ago he had calf cramps and missed a week of training.
Clearly, the rest left him fresh, not rusty.
“I’m so happy,” Gebrselassie told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and I had doubts today, but in the end everything went well."
He has been criticized - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's East African rival - for overly orchestrating his races, generally avoiding many of the world's best marathon stars, relying on a trailblazer as if it were a mid-course race, and placing world records above the sense of competition.
But these criticisms rarely diminish the greatness of Gebrselassie’s skills as a marathon runner.
With the pace set by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie reached the halfway point in 1:02:04.
Two elite Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, held Gebrselassie competition after the trail openers vanished.
With just over three miles to go, Gebrselassie made a final push to break away from Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his personal best time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi finished third in 2:07:48.
In the women’s race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan who is now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year by winning in 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time ever.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, Mikitenko, 36, was a surprise winner of the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She missed the Beijing Games with what is described as a bad accident, but healed to win in Berlin, setting her personal best of almost five minutes in the third marathon she ran.
You ran a race doing the math well, letting a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners start with a big gap, picking them up after about 18 and a half miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia finished second in 2:21.31, while Helena Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
In a city apart, pride and processes of a black life
Tucked away in the sprawling theme park on the outskirts of Orlando, just a few miles from the splendor, the noise, the enormous, lies the quiet city where the pride and complications of the African-American experience come into life.
Eatonville, the first all-black town incorporated into the country and the birthplace of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "the town of five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, plenty of guava, two schools and no prison."
It is now a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to show their respect for Hurston, Harlem Renaissance’s most famous writer.
Yet in many ways, the city he described—and which makes tourists stop by including it in the Florida travel guide produced by the Depression-era Federal Writers’ Project—remains a place apart.
She is as independent, dignified, and private as she was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted sharing their thoughts with the white man, that "knowing so little of us, she doesn't know what she's missing."
Even now, in a year when a black presidential nominee, Senator Barack Obama, has been called in for an opening speech on race, many here remain wary of the outsider’s gaze.
“We are very cautious about how our story is told,” said Hortense Jones, 59, a lifelong resident and member of the city’s oldest church.
"It must be right."
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and difficulty.
It is both a historical model of black power grabs and a community of nearly 2,400 where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a literary center but also an example in the shadow of the rural black culture of the south - sometimes scorned, sometimes rewarded - born of American slavery.
Not surprisingly, residents here are both proud and protective.
And the concern for Eatonville's image really began with Zora, who everyone here calls Hurston.
She introduced the world to her hometown through sincere, dialect-rich books, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs of Florida’s guide transformed the city, just off Route 17, a road that runs through Florida’s often-forgotten downtown into a backdrop of black history and human drama.
Bass as a bass drum in both life and literature, Hurston took readers to the store owned by Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then diverted to more private areas.
"Outside the street on the left," he wrote, "is the modern public school, brown with white trim, with its well-kept gardens and courtyards, which Howard Miller always looked out for, thinking he could just read and write."
She also mentioned the widow Dash's new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and whatever suits passing rooms".
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston connected Eatonville with self-government but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
Clearly this wasn't Fodor's.
In fact, it was not a portrait that everyone appreciated.
“Zora said it like it was,” said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of the Johnson girls Hurston immortalizes by quoting men singing coarse songs about their beauty.
He adds: "Some people don't like it."
Hurston is still remembered here as a lively eccentric who frequently returned to her family after moving to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembers that when Hurston came to town, he would usually arrive unannounced in a triumphant Chevrolt, smoking and wearing pants in a city that still boasts of dignified dress.
Many inhabitants were fascinated, Mr. Franklin says, while others sneered.
“People were always very happy to see Zora,” Mr. Franklin said.
But, she added, swinging on her chair on the back patio overlooking Sabelia Lake, where Hurston was most likely baptized, “she never stayed long.”
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books had gone out of print.
Along with the rest of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an unmarked grave at Fort Pierce, Fla., where she had lived.
In Eatonville, there were no big memorial ceremonies, and no big conferences.
"I don't think they understand his contribution to the world or his legacy to everyone," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a biography of Hurston published in 2003.
A change occurred in the 1980s.
Orange County officials wanted to place a five-lane highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the two-lane main road.
Orlando's expansion has already pushed Interstate 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal came as Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to the relative idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the battle over racial mixing brought hatred to the front door of the community.
“During that time, a group of white boys came and threw oranges and things at the people sitting on the side,” says Mr. Franklin.
“We actually had a girl who was killed by that one time.
They threw a watermelon out of a car."
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston petitioned the Supreme Court for forced integration, calling his decision in Brown against the school office "an insult rather than an honor to my race."
Residents now say that the desegregation of schools, despite having been positive in some respects, dilutes Eatonville’s cohesion and jeopardizes the confidence of its young people.
“Black kids were used to being hugged — I remember this — hugging your teacher in the morning, hugging your teacher in the evening,” said N. Y. Nathiri, the daughter of Ella Dinkins and the executive director of Preserve the Eatonville Community, a nonprofit group.
This lasted, he added, until the teachers and students came from the same place.
“You didn’t embrace your white teacher because your white teacher — I mean, there’s a cultural divide there,” Ms. Nathiri said.
Civil rights, however, helped and created space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons - black writer, actress and artist who overcame prejudices, as she did, with cheerful self-assurance and lines like: "How can some deny themselves the pleasure of my company!
I just can't figure it out."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker began a long journey to Hurston's unmarked grave and began to fight for the resurrection of her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed Hurston biography by Robert E. Hemenway hit the shelves of bookstores, reintroducing it to the American canon.
The highway project came just as his most famous daughter had once again caught the limelight.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The community began designing a festival dedicated to Hurston in 1988 to show what could ruin the state with its highway.
Thousands of fans came to the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return for the commemoration.
Many years later, the state pulled back from its project for the street.
“The five lanes of the resurrected highway brought what one would call high speed, a real pride for the city,” Ms. Nathiri said.
Mrs. Boyd puts it more simply: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the highway project helped change the city’s image of itself.
Out-of-towners like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began coming to church here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and residents began to reevaluate the past.
Eatonville was added to the public historical record in 1998.
A new single-storey bookstore (called Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on a paved and beautified Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a Florida anomaly: just six miles from downtown Orlando, it can give the feel of a back road in the summer rain, as small as when it was founded with just 27 black families in the 1880s.
(It’s 90 percent black today.)
Outsiders who come to look for Eatonville’s story, for its significance, are often still treated with caution.
A permission requested in advance is required for most of the interviews, so some things — like murals on the oldest church in Eatonville, painted by a white man, showing black men in the fields — are not allowed to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Ms. Jones, a plump teacher with a penchant for bright red, still fear that their island community will be misunderstood.
Yet, as soon as the Hurston festival expanded, a high level of city pride also emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville with Hurston seeing his entire race: beautiful, trouble and all, neither better nor worse and proud, creative, hardworking, silly and confused like other races and ethnic groups in America.
It is sincere civic affection that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin’s grandson, Edwin Harvey, 18, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or for the Police Department, which he said may need help.
And even those who are younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
“A lot of people, if they’ve just walked in here, they’re going to think, ‘Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others,’” Alondra Kenon said after Mass on a recent Sunday.
“But if you really stop and take a moment to look at history, it’s really a pretty town.”
Here in New York we all speak fluently about finance
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the newsstands and huge TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn’t notice they were in the eye of the storm.
They would never guess that the glass offices, honeycombed above their heads, the bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York City are experiencing every day the worst “bad day in the office” since the 1929 meltdown.
The deliverymen shake metal tea carts across the sidewalks, carrying trays of muffins for breakfast meetings.
Latin Americans drag their feet between condos carrying, like human mules, 50 and broken shirts strung from a cane on their shoulders.
Employees are still waiting in line for their morning bagel at the food carts on the sidewalks, and it is still impossible to take a yellow taxi between 4pm and 7pm on a working day.
It didn’t seem like there was a real crisis, until, with all the talk of ruin and sadness, I decided to open a new savings account on Thursday afternoon.
Although I had planned the affair to coincide with the late afternoon break at my JP Morgan Chase branch, a queue of about twenty was already waiting in line.
Not in front of the cashier’s desk, to withdraw money or make deposits, but in front of the customer service desk, where old customers order checkbooks, tourists ask for directions to the Macy’s department store and new customers open accounts.
Many of those in front of me, I would then learn from Starr, my “trusted banker”, were in line for the same reason.
Unlike me, however, they have already taken their savings from the smaller banks from the places they commute from, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They have taken money from so-called thrifts (a bit like a construction company), credit unions, and types of city savings banks whose branches operate only within a state, and they say they treat customers like family.
In the past few years, 15 of these banks have gone bankrupt.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, was subjected to controlled administration, and, as New Yorkers headed home for the weekend on a Friday afternoon, another bank, Wachovia, with savings deposits of $440 billion, was looking for a buyer to save it.
The employees and clerks who stood in front of me, fearful of another collapse, were moving their money to a bank perceived as a safe haven, the bank that is asking Wall Street for more collateral.
Ordinary New Yorkers in recent weeks have become proficient in finance.
A woman at my trusted Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the bankrupt bank, and its emaciated CEO Dick Fuld in all familiarity, as if complaining about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed janitor, nearly 50 years old in my apartment building, has changed the subject from our normal topic of conversation about Brad and Angelina or the delivery of my groceries.
She told me, after my visit to the bank, "Now I have all my savings in market funds!.
I've changed, I'm not taking any risks."
Muslim graves desecrated as Austria turns right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, to the left of the Austrian right wing of the Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of the right-wing Belgian party Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to present the organization "Cities against Islamization" in Antwerp, Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry signs such as road signs representing mosques with a red line passing in between.
Police have blamed right-wing extremists for desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same week that far-right political parties gained a lot in the national general election.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged at the Traun cemetery near Linz in a few hours between Friday night and this morning in what police believe was an organised action.
The culprits spray-painted Jewish symbols like the Star of David over some graves, but detectives believe it may have been an attempt to mask extremist motivations driven by a hatred for Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is in any way linked to the election.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the desecration, which took place towards the end of Ramadan, a month of religious significance for Muslims.
Austria meanwhile embarked on a spiritual research journey following its turn to the right in yesterday’s parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that took nearly 30 percent of the vote, the Austrian Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, campaigned with vehemently anti-immigration tickets and some of their slogans were defined by xenophobic critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against veils and burqas and also expressed his opposition to foods that are perceived to be connected to Islam.
At the final meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a “European brotherhood” to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties appear to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, claiming they are political symbols of the continued Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses made immediately after the elections, which established the far right as the nation’s strongest political bloc, indicate that the change was led predominantly by young voters who are worried about their future in the European Union.
Travel abroad forbidden to Gary Glitter.
Gary Glitter, the glamorous rock star guilty of child sexual abuse, has been banned from traveling to France and Spain by the court.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed the authorities controlling him that he wanted to go to Spain via France.
The travel ban was granted to Kent police last Thursday after they provided the magistrates with evidence of Glitter’s previous arrests for child sexual abuse.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadi, was not present at the Ashford, Kent, court hearing but was represented by Corker Binning's lawyers.
A spokesman for the Court Service said: “On Thursday 25 September at Ashford Magistrates’ Court, Kent Police have made a request to prevent Mr Paul Gadd from travelling abroad to France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd was not present in person."
Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad as required by the register of convicted sex offenders.
He must notify the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
He is also required to give the police seven days’ notice of his expected departure date.
Failure to notify the authority can lead to a sentence of five years in prison.
Kent police said they did not want to discuss Glitter’s individual cases or possible movements around the country.
A Kent Police spokesman said: “The Kent Police will do whatever is necessary to protect children in this country or abroad.
“From our perspective, it’s easier to control someone who stays in the UK because we have comprehensive systems in place to manage every potential risk more effectively.
“Protecting Kent residents is the primary concern of the Kent Police and we work closely to monitor the behaviour of convicted sex offenders in the country to minimise any possible risk to the public.
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls aged 10 and 11.
When Glitter came he flew to Bangkok where he was to board a flight to London.
But he said he felt ill and refused to fly to London.
Thai authorities would not have him pass passport control and eventually took a flight to Hong Kong.
Even the Chinese authorities would not let him enter and he returned to Bangkok where Thai police and immigration officials insisted he return to England.
He eventually arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on 22 August and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to Uxbridge Magistrates' Court, west of London, since Scotland Yard had successfully applied for an order to put him on the sex offenders' register.
Glitter had previously been incarcerated in the UK in 1999 for possessing images of child abuse.
An Interior Ministry source said Interior Secretary Jacqui Smith felt reassured and happy that Glitter had been stopped from traveling to France and Spain.
"Photographer the master away from the scene to extract the character" G<0xC3><0xBC>nther Bauer, photographer
Neither heels nor ruffles nor dresses from before.
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenco, stripped of the concentration that characterizes the interpretation, to look at the relaxed appearance of the man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other, the person.
Two inseparable faces, except in private, in those moments far from the public, when the intimacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of the hands, are natural because they do not have to go on stage.
The German G<0xC3><0xBC>nther Bauer in "Flamenco-People" alternates the theatricality of some shots to singers, dancers and guitarists on stage with the lesser known side of these masters.
With this lens, the photographer offers an original iconography of flamenco, seizing it from different visual angles.
The exhibition, included in the program of the Flamenco Photography Month, reflects the international importance of this dance, every day more and more," explains the artist and clarifies that in "Flamenco-People" it could also be about ordinary people, but seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists, interpreters or performers on the scene.
These people portrayed “on the street” are “artists capable of conveying passion, sadness, joy when they are on stage ... and of capturing the audience.
To capture the personality of these greats it is not necessary to portray them on stage,
because their personality and character are internal.
What interested me was to create an intimate atmosphere that allowed me to capture with the camera the personality of the greats of flamenco."
With a passion for the festival "Cante de las Minas", Bauer began in 1997 a long journey aimed at portraying singers, guitarists or dancers using a plate camera.
They are portraits that, due to the type of machine and the material, resemble classical photography.
The application of different stylistic techniques breaks with the traditional principles of the image, giving the photo modernity, according to an idea that reflects Bauer's own conception of flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and is able to surprise every day."
Not dancing, singing or playing in itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, able to conquer the public with his art.
The search for an encounter with the essential elements, with the magic that becomes visible in a certain way of feeling and being, are and have been the constant of this work, on display these days at the gallery El Fot<0xC3><0xB3>mata.
Famous flamenco artists such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are included in this selection of about seventy portrait artists.
The project has become a sort of flamenco anthology, and will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits exhibited on the occasion of the exhibition.
The passion for portraits led Bauer to repeat the idea two years ago with "Portraits of veteran athletes" ("SportARTproject").
Although in "Flamenco-People" the concept is different, the photographer admits "I love to portray people, to know them and to be able to penetrate for a moment in their lives, whether this is a long or a short moment.
I think portraiture is the most difficult genre in photography.
You meet or confront people, characters that sometimes you don’t even know or who give you only a few minutes to take the picture.
Beyond these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to concretize my ideas.
The collection of portraits of contemporary flamenco, entitled "Flamenco-people" is set up at the El Fot<0xC3><0xB3>mata gallery, at number 20 in via de la Mata, parallel to via Alameda de Hercules, and will be open to the public until next October 16.
Vargas Llosa reveals that the novel he is writing is a "hazard"
It is set in places he does not yet know and deals with unknown topics: despite this, Mario Vargas Llosa is struggling with a new project he is working on, a novel whose protagonist, Roger Casemant, is an Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in Congo and crossed the Amazon.
Always a favorite for the Nobel Prize for Literature, the writer confessed yesterday at the Hay Festival in Segovia, that the project he is dealing with today "is a gamble" and that "everything indicates that I should not write it."
"If I had common sense, I would not write it, but I will do it anyway and I hope to finish it as soon as possible," concluded his speech at the festival for the exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that for four days saw a hundred writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people pass through the city of the Aqueduct.
The author of "La ciudad y los perros" was, as predicted, the leading figure at the third edition of the word festival.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award for being the most voted writer by the participants – an ancient edition of Dickens’ book “Our Mutual Friend” – filled the seats of the Juan Bravo theater.
Presented by Félix Romeo, the writer found himself in front of an audience to which time has flown when the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with large doses of humor, recalled how the literary vocation was born in him, derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of the "pleasure to read" and "to live beyond what I lived"; as he writes in his "mode"
The Spanish-American novelist recognized that "there is no way" to measure and know if books can change people's lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is a pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience," stressed Vargas Llosa, arguing that, on the contrary, "it has effects" and that "it makes people more "non-conformist."
Time hinders the Pozoblanco Festival, depriving it of bullfights
The celebration of the bullfights that were supposed to seal the days of the Pozoblanco Festival was suspended yesterday morning, after the bullfighters selected for the bullfights had verified that the soil conditions of the square were not adequate.
Therefore, the company, in agreement with Fermin Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernandez, decided to suspend the celebration of the bullfight.
The bad weather has raged against this Festival, preventing us from celebrating two days out of three.
On Saturday, rain prevented the second bullfight.
The lineup included Jose Luis Moreno, Curro Diaz and Juan Bautista, who were due to face a bull from Castilblanco.
Therefore, the Festival had regular performance only on Fridays.
On this occasion it was Daniel Luque who triumphed, cutting off three ears and being brought out in triumph, after having toured with taste and aesthetics.
That same afternoon Alejandro Talavante completed his two bullfights receiving greetings and an ear, granted more by the public than by the bullfight itself.
The worst of all was El Juli, passing from the arena of Los Llanos without glory and without pain.
With the second bull, after a tremendous crutch, he earned the whistles of most of the audience.
A van with two thousand kilos of hashish crosses the checkpoint in <0xC3><0x81>lava
Five minus ten in the morning.
The agents subpoena the alt to the two occupants of a van that instead of stopping they run away.
The officers subpoenaed the alt to the two occupants of a van who, instead of stopping, fled.
Their load, more than two tons of hashish, is a good reason not to stop.
After chasing them, they manage to arrest one of the two occupants, a man of about 28 years, identified as A. A. J., according to the statement of the Department of the Interior of the Basque Government.
The arrested individual is charged with drug trafficking and forgery of public documents.
The accident occurred when some officials of the Alava road were carrying out a transport control on the N-1, at the point where it crosses the municipal district of Armi<0xC3><0xB1><0xC3><0xB3>n.
They were about to stop a van for inspection when the driver, in violation of orders, accelerated sharply and crossed the checkpoint.
The officers pursued until the vehicle, after a couple of kilometers, stopped at the edge of the road and its two occupants fled into a wooded area.
The Ertzaintza agents then managed to arrest one of the fugitives and seize the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were carrying and took note once they inspected the van, an Iveco Daily.
The hash buns, which were in the back of the vehicle, were later placed in police custody for a thorough investigation and weight detection.
In addition, since the officials ascertained that the registration had been "duplicated" since it did not coincide with the one reported in the documentation of the van, the arrested person was also charged with the crime of falsifying public documents.
The Ertzaintza is continuing its investigation to arrest the second suspect, who managed to escape as already mentioned, and to determine the provenance of the seized drug.
Detainee A.A.J., 28, was taken to the police station to carry out the appropriate procedures and be available to the judge in the coming hours.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the influence of drugs
Actress Heather Locklear, the Amanda of the popular series Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the influence of drugs.
A witness saw her perform risky maneuvers as she tried to drive out of the parking lot in Montecito, a California highway spokesman told People magazine.
The witness specified that around 4:30 p.m. Locklear "crushed the accelerator, making a lot of noise, and trying to get the car out of the parking lot with sudden back and forth maneuvers.
Shortly after, the witness, who at first glance apparently did not recognize the actress, saw that Locklear had stopped in a nearby road and had exited the vehicle.
It was this person who alerted the emergency services, because "she was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, partially blocking the road.
"She seemed confused," and so the officers took her to a specialist drug and alcohol center for testing.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was collaborative and the hypothesis of excess alcohol was discarded from the beginning, although "according to what was observed by the officers at first, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of some drug."
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of some unspecified substance and was locked up in the local prison around 7 p.m., to be released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear had recovered from a specialist clinic in Arizona after being hospitalized following an episode of anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian federation of the IU to assume its responsibilities in the Silva case
The general coordinator of the UI and member of the Izquierda Unida party, Gaspar Llamazares, confirmed today that it will be up to the regional federation of formation to make a decision on the case of the former councilor for Youth and Sport of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week following the accusation of clientelism.
"In these cases I am particularly federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that will have to assume its responsibilities," Llamazares said regarding the resolution that the party will have to adopt against what has been until now councilor in the Sevillian council.
However, the UI leader stressed the need for "transparency" in all possible investigations regarding the irregularities that Silva would have committed. "The UI has always wanted this type of investigation to have maximum transparency."
He also pointed out that training is regulated by "very strict ethical codes for all public offices."
"Sangre de Mayo", the epic bet of Garci
Inspired by the National Episodes of Benito Pérez Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s, Jose Luis Garci reprises the famous revolt of the Spanish against the French in Sangre de Mayo, in what is the most ambitious film of his filmography, with almost 15 million euros of budget.
With this film, the director tried to "illustrate the torrent of characters and at the same time the social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutierrez and Paula Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a at the head of a wide cast of actors.
Sangre de mayo, more than two and a half hours long, debuts this Friday in cinemas, to become in the future a television miniseries of more than four hours on TeleMadrid.
A great admirer of Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s's literature, Jose Luis Garci claims to have realized with this shot "a dream of his childhood", and believes he has to thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Community of Madrid had commissioned him three years before shooting a commemorative film for the second centenary of May 2 in Madrid.
The 15 million budgets allocated in full by the Community of Madrid represented for Garci a "unique opportunity" to recreate the scenographies and the adequate customs to portray a "a stunned Spain that wronged the choice of the leader for which to fight and the fact that the struggle for independence brought to the people a huge delay in the development under the reign of Ferdinand VII" observed Garci.
However, the director regrets that he has not received funding equal to those of Alatriste or Los fantasmas de Goya - more than twice as much as Sangre de mayo, so it was not possible to shoot some scenes provided by the scenography that he had signed together with Horacio Valcarcel, collaborator of almost his entire career.
This, for the director of Volver a empezar, has influenced what is his usual work practice, the staging with the actors, with whom he often uses to try before shooting together with those who will not be part of the cast, because he considers it "humiliating," considering that "part of the director's work lies in going to the theater and to the cinema to know what is happening in the sector in which he works."
Many of the actors, some of whom are part of the cast of Sangre de mayo, try in front of his car, as in the case of Michael Rell, Carlos Larranaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Nominated for an Oscar four times - winning one - Garci believes that none of the three films nominated to represent Spain this year at the Hollywood Academy - his Sangre de mayo, Siete mesas de billar francés and, the last selected Los girasoles ceigos - do not represent the youngest generation of Spanish cinema "that should instead be known."
From this film Garci does not expect awards.
“At first you think you’re working for posterity, then you realize you’re only working for prosperity, and at some point you’re settling for just shooting one more film,” Garci explains after more than 30 years in the business.
Isabel Bayon rediscovers the Seville essence of the dancer Tortola Valencia
A Sevillian dancer pays tribute to another dancer also from Seville.
Carmen Valencia Tortola, Catalan father (Florence Tortola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district, and at the age of three moved with the family to London.
She was a free dance dancer and a specialist in oriental dances.
She led a fascinating life and was a pioneer of female emancipation, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
He was a Buddhist and vegetarian, and championed the cause for the abolition of the corset which prevented women from moving freely.
The life of this woman, who marked a revolution in the field of dance and aesthetics in Europe between the two wars, has always fascinated Isabel Bayon.
"I would have liked to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this character to me. It seemed incredible."
According to the dancer: "We do not intend to tell her entire life, but to collect her spirit.
The titles of his dances suggested me some basic elements of flamenco.
So, "la danza de la mariposa" suggested me a guajira, or "la danza de la serpiente" some tangos.
His dancing was sensual and I was told that my dancing was part of that aesthetic as well,” she explains.
The staging includes two exceptional contributions: that of Miguel Poveda, who will sing again Isabel in one of his shows, as face in "La puerta aberta"; and that of the teacher Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work with the one who had been a student of his.
"Matilde plays Tortola as an adult, the character of maturity.
I’m happy because she agreed to work on my work and I feel very honored about that.”
The set-up also includes the musical composition and guitarists such as Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, the singing of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga y Moi of Mor<0xC3><0xB3>n; the percussions of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa La Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfran Juárez "who has always had the role of eternal accompanist of these artists who have been spasim, becoming all things."
In the work is also present in some form the life of this woman who takes place in distant places, especially for that time, such as India, the United States or Russia, and then all of Europe, since, habitually, resided in London.
"I wanted to remember her, because I think she is one of the women who had a huge influence in a given historical period and now no one remembers her and much less considers her work as something of value," says Bayon.
The show will begin today, at 8.30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega theater.
With the publication of the "Diario de un poeta reciente casado" the Triennio also closes
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado" at the church of Saint Stephen (New York), where Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Department of Culture of the Junta de Andaluc<0xC3><0xAD>a to celebrate the "Triennial of Zenobia and Juan Ramon" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of his death.
Thus, the "Triennio de Zenobia e Juan Ramon" concludes with the re-edition of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the house-museum of the Nobel and with the itinerant exhibition "Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez: Aquel chopo de luz", which was inaugurated last May and which, after having touched the various provinces of Andalusia in York, is expected to
In addition, the Department of Culture of the Junta de Andaluc<0xC3><0xAD>a has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado", edited by Pietro Tabernero and illustrated by James Perez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and work of one of the most valuable Andalusian poets.
America likes a little less without Paul Newman
“Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them."
The phrase is by actress Sally Field, who worked with him on "Absencia de malicia" and gives the idea of the impotence of American cinema, and of all America, in the face of the shocking idea that Newman has left.
It cost him a lot to win an Oscar.
Since 2007 he has been retired.
It was also known that he was very ill.
Despite this, it was a very hard blow for everyone.
"Sometimes what one feels goes beyond any expression, and I have now lost a great friend," cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country could have been better because of its existence."
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
A father of cinema and the homeland died at a particularly dark time, out of fear of terrorists and markets, with self-esteem by the American people on the ground, desperate for new motivations to feel worthy.
When times are so difficult, men so without virtue and remain well people to admire, you do not need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all he embodied the Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and champion of causes lost and lost, from the foundation for the fight against drugs created in honor of the first-born son who died of an overdose to the creation of the brand of homemade and organic food.
All gifts to a country that has cost a lot to go beyond a suicidal food culture.
The wave of admiration went beyond Hollywood, with no regard for nationality or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, observed that not one man died, an era is over.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes, said working with Newman was nothing less than the pinnacle of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, has ventured to call Paul Newman his greatest inspiration.
“He set a very high standard for all of us,” says George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today try to live as Paul Newman did: keeping in high regard the need for rectitude and to have a serious and private life away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or possible in today’s media jungle.
However, some try and Paul Newman is a good example for these.
He divorced once but remained married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he remained faithful although he certainly did not lack the opportunities not to be so.
"Why am I going out to eat burgers today, if I have a steak at home?" he used to joke.
In heaven he is accompanied by the pride that on earth his daughters are also his admirers, something not so common in America.
“Among all the great roles he played, no one was as proud of him as that of a devoted husband, loving father, caring grandfather, and passionate philanthropist,” they say.
The imperfect race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that sooner or later the Olympics will be held in Madrid and, after the failed attempt for 2012, this could happen in 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday's race, I would say no!
They called it the "perfect race", but in my opinion it was by far the worst I've ever witnessed.
A lot of nonsense, that if they were later taken into account in the evaluation and I had to examine them, the response would be absolutely negative.
But let's go in order and start from the beginning.
The nonsense began with the withdrawal of the ridge, which assumed that you would go first.
It didn't seem like a bad idea, but if they force you to go, it's to pick up everything (including the chip to avoid queues during the race).
I don't think so.
You had to go just to get the dorsal (first nonsense, go just for this) and (after its tail), surprise! they had only size 'S' t-shirts (second nonsense, because I need a size XL).
What world do we live in?
Is it the fault of the crisis if they decided to buy only small T-shirts, made with less fabric and therefore less expensive?
Well, things like that are trifles compared to the day of the race itself.
In addition to having to go very early to get the chip, the waiting queue was 15 minutes and, moreover, you had to deposit the backpack.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a race that is expected more than 11,000 people.
So, as expected, the race started that we had not even deposited the backpack yet, although, once we succeeded in the venture, the recovery was even worse.
In addition, the rain threatened the wait of more than 40 minutes, to which were added attempts at popular rebellion and assault on the stand.
In at least 500 people tomorrow we will definitely have pneumonia, and some, like me, will not even result in the ranking in correct order because of the chip that, I suppose, did not register the arrival correctly.
In the future, if they ask me about the perfect race, it will certainly not enter my thoughts.
So I think we will continue to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft cerca receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT conference on emerging technologies, Microsoft previewed a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of artificial intelligence, but without much intelligence, capable of performing some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or, in the case illustrated by Microsoft, a shuttle service to move around the company's campus) assisting the telephone user.
Thanks to a camera and a face and shape recognition system, this “receptionist” is able to know how many people are in a room, who they are – including remembering their position in the company – and to listen to and understand the keywords in a conversation with them.
You can also group people into conversation groups.
In the example video, the receptionist detects a third person, but understands that he does not belong to the group with which he is talking and that he is not an employee of the company.
He asks her if she is there to visit someone and tells her that she will be available shortly.
All without a blue screen.
Impressive.
But this, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example on the next version of its Windows operating system.
There has been a lot of talk this week about a change in strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and won’t have as many programs associated with it.
Steve Ballmer found that if computers were equipped with the essential functions and less loaded with commercial garbage, they would go five times faster – hey! Steve, it will be for “least”.
A whole discovery, if you take into account that Microsoft, version after version has continuously added to Windows features and "extra".
The change of direction is appreciable.
Microsoft is right: the operating system is increasingly losing importance, and with it the software.
When Google launched Chrome on the net, I was one of those who supported the theory that it was Google’s first step to competing with Windows.
Many rightly point out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is an essential element for the hardware and software to communicate.
It performs the same function as your wife or husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law.
It's true.
It will never disappear, but perhaps it is necessary to think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but relative.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system, and more and more to the web browser.
You take your computer just to launch Explorer or Firefox — or Chrome — and every day we spend more time surfing the web than in a remote windowed environment.
What are half the applications of the operating system used for?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 needs to be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less overload, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services so that they are a valid alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, in fact, and here is a small example.
I took the photo in this post at one of Microsoft’s employee recreation facilities in Redmond earlier this month.
On the drinks machine a sign urges them to use their own search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees use Google to conduct a web search.
Last week, the delay in the development of the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was confirmed.
It will not be on the market in early 2009, but probably at the end of the year, if not in 2010.
Microsoft will certainly try to jointly launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The mobile phone, after all, is becoming more and more a computer.
But the delay, with Android and the iPhone already on the market, is penalizing.
La Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso took her to the C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio shone in Edward Zwick's 'Diamante de sangre', as well as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' as well as being part of the typical uniform of the muscular gay parish.
And if we try to enumerate the appearances of the stars, we can recall the image of the strongman with pointed mustache lifting weights in the traveling circus.
It is, in essence, the typical men's t-shirt, with the inside of cotton, tight and sleeveless.
It is the 'tank', as the English speakers call it, although the Belgian Fabuleux Marcel stands out above all.
The "Marcel" excels compared to the others for the high quality of the cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive coat of arms and for the small Belgian flag (just recognizable), which the most emblematic models of the shirt carry as a detail on the neck.
The "Marcel" excels compared to the others for the high quality of the cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive coat of arms and for the small Belgian flag (barely recognizable), which the most emblematic t-shirt models wear as a detail on the neck.
And be careful, because the production of the Belgian company is not only about the famous "tanks".
It also includes college sweatshirts, retro boxer shorts, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, sailor t-shirts, baby-dolls, mini shorts...
Underwear designed to be comfortable.
And it's a shame to use them as underwear.
They're too pretty.
"I want to be a young mom, the candidate doesn't worry me"
Her great resemblance to her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz is small, but full of vitality.
Currently, the Cruz sisters have taken their new fashion business very seriously.
For Monica, they are much more than beautiful girls and celebrities who lend their name.
It was in Paris for the promotion that the Mango signature has made of its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important awards that the Spanish fashion house sponsors.
Warm and shy, it conquers you quickly.
Tell us what you do in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I designed for the autumn-winter season of Mango, as well as to participate in the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the dinner at the Opera in honor of Valentino.
Let's say, a very intense day, but at the same time, exciting.
From what elements does your new collection for Mango start in this fourth season of work for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I like the cinema of the 50's and 60's, from here we get various inspirations.
Then, I love to get lost in the city and observe how women dress, how they combine and mix their clothes. I do it frequently.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you are a very versatile woman, right?
I think so, although in the end, everything comes together and there are many elements in common.
I, as a child, liked clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother’s house to rummage through my aunt’s closets and see her clothes.
It was a bomb, even better than going to the playground.
Then, once a dancer, I always paid a lot of attention to dressing.
It is known that dancers really like to have their own style to go to class and to the sages, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And as an actress, when they hand you the wardrobe it’s the moment you actually meet the character.
So, everything goes together, yes, with a lot of respect for stylists and professionalism.
Not so long ago, you turned 30, you went into crisis?
No, I don't.
Never heard better, I like the idea of 30 years.
I find that at that age women are mature and have a good experience to savor life by making fewer mistakes.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I have done the things I wanted since I was a child and this has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, you think you're gonna be a mother, do you?
Of course, I know that I will be a mother because my own body asks me to, and I also want to be a young mother, I don’t want to miss that.
As for the candidate, I don’t worry too much.
What I will do is give a lot of happiness to my son and educate him with a lot of love.
As for cinema, you are waiting for a few films shot last year to come out in different theaters.
That's right, and I'm really looking forward to them coming out.
Being a woman who comes from the theater, I am very impatient and restless, I would like everything immediately and clearly, but it can not always be like this.
I want it out of "The Last Hour" and "In Search of the Tomb of Christ."
Let's see if you like them
A few days ago you debuted on the catwalk with Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like I was on the catwalk as a model.
Simply Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for a long time, called me to invite me to go to London to participate in a charity parade for her organization “Women for a Better World” and the clothes we exhibited – I brought two pieces of our collection for Mango – were auctioned to raise funds for this NGO of Naomi.
People don't know this tender side of Naomi.
They say so many things about her, that I who have known her for a long time can confirm to you that they are not so true.
Also, I find myself with this good part in which you are involved.
He asked me to parade for a noble cause, but if he asked me to do the pine, I would have done it anyway.
If it's to help women in the third world, you can't back down.
Relapsing drivers of alcoholism will have to install the "alcolock"
The Ministry of the Interior requires that drivers with three administrative sanctions for excessive blood alcohol levels install in their car the system that prevents driving the vehicle while drunk or if it does not blow into the appropriate device.
The measure was announced last June and is already included in the annual report of the State Attorney General, according to which it will be a pilot project lasting one year.
The aim of this project is the reintegration of the driver, since he will have to attend a rehabilitation course on the road.
In this initiative, in addition to the General Prosecutor for Road Safety, the General Directorate of Traffic (DGT) and the Technological Institute for Automobile Safety (FITSA) Foundation will participate.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists reported more than once for drunk driving then return to drive the car.
The alcoholock would avoid it, because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the rate of alcohol in the exhaled air and prevents the car from starting if the driver does not blow, or when a higher alcohol concentration is detected than allowed.
The cost is more than 1000 euros and would be charged to the sanctioned.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with such devices can reduce up to 65% of infringements committed during the first year of introduction.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people a year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to put a stop to these behaviours before they become criminal offences.
And to facilitate its development, since legal reform can be carried out by ordinary means, and, no doubt, the reform necessary for criminal procedure would require an organic law.
However, the device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial solution, although it has already been experimentally introduced in some industrial and public vehicles.
Just tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on an initiative of the PSOE in which it proposes to install this system in school buses, as has already been done in France.
In Mexico, and without peep-toes
With British punctuality, at 5.40 p.m., according to the program, the Spanish plane in which the princes of Asturias traveled landed in the presidential hangar at the Benito Juárez airport in Mexico City.
The sun was setting but the rays still forced him to use his hand as a visor to see the royal couple get off the plane.
At the foot of the ladder, the Spanish ambassador and the other authorities.
A few hours earlier I had asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish princes were going to visit the city to formalize an official trip.
- Ah, very well, so you can not go to the airport to load people at that time ... You are from here or ...
No, no, sir, you're Spanish, but you lived here for a couple of years.
- Ah, very well...
The Mexican press, on the other hand, knows very well who the princes of Asturias are and the importance of travel.
There are many waiting in the airport hangar crushed by the red carpet and military cordon composed of 27 soldiers of the navy who offer the greeting of honor.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the princess, foliage in the wind, very sober, does not use her usual "peep-toes," perhaps they told her that in Mexico City threatened bad weather.
They give the photographers a smile and a short stop before passing in the room where the official party awaits them.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four largest in the city, a witty Mexican television reporter awaits them.
The best prize offered by fashion
There is probably no more appropriate place in the world to present a fashion award, than Paris and probably there is no designer more exquisite and bont vive than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the El Bot<0xC3><0xB3>n-Mango Fashion Awards, to encourage the international promotion of new talents in the field of fashion.
It offers a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her drawings in Mango’s window at 54 Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost cried from the emotion.
Moreover, it is the second largest store of the company in Europe and has just been opened with 1,335 square meters of extension.
The first is in London.
The many events, combined with the desire to please the designer Valentino who presided over the jury of the competition, began with a luxury dinner at the Opera Garnier in Paris.
With the proximity of the most exquisite canvases of Chagal, the presidential gala table prepared by Mango, was even more spectacular.
Born, with a broken heart and making virtue of necessity, due to the recent death of his brother, he wore a dress of the House and some complements of ELAH to take his breath away and to the arm of his son Luis - a big boy of almost two meters in height - he accompanied Valentino to the presidency of the tribute dinner.
Andik, owner and lord of Mango, did the honours of home and knighthood which he finished, together with Baron Rotchil, without jacket, because both had ceded them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who ran the shop in trousers and shirt – designed by her own hand – turned for dinner, wearing a long, very sensual black dress and got excited during the night walk accompanied by Goya Toledo inside the opera, when they showed us the hall for the ballet essays and she, remembering other times, grabbed a bar and abbza
Inés Sastre did not stop for a walk in the premises of the building, but had shown us first the photos of her son on her mobile phone.
The next day we rejoiced at the presence of Olivier Martinez – another big guy who moves by motorcycle – and of John Travolta, who had arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and having made sure previously, that there were no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh there, that's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are not 1,000 but 1,000 and a way to forget the chaotic and hectic daily life.
And as if that were not enough, they are all collected in a book that will bring relaxation to bookstores on September 30.
The alarm clock is almost a punishment when it rings every morning at 7, but it is even worse to imagine yourself involved in the hectic pace dictated by modern life.
The office is called tension and the computer back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
However, there are no one or even two methods to combat daily exhaustion and the struggle to disengage from the world of work.
No, this number amounts to no more and no less than 1001.
Beyond the yoga positions, the classic massage or the "spa" treatments, Susannah Marriott collects in the pages of her book, a whole "menu" of options tailored to the taste and time of each.
The anti-stress work is entitled "1001 Ways to Relax" and its calmness will reach the bookstores thanks to the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is not possible to gain calm in areas such as work or personal relationships, this "manual" refutes this belief.
In addition, it suggests alternative solutions, such as being in contact with nature, or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline isn’t already flowing into your veins to regain body balance and stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit on the couch, turn off your mind and focus on reading.
Talking in your sleep
Some children talk at night.
I am not referring to those who wake up very agitated to tell us something that happened to them the day before, but to those children who talk while staying asleep.
The first time it happens, at most it takes a scare, but it doesn’t really matter much.
This is a benign sleep disorder called somniloquy.
It manifests itself with a certain frequency, especially in children and adolescents.
Surely, most of you have been told that you spoke in your sleep.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (once in a lifetime, for example associated with an episode of high fever) or with greater regularity (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the day after the baby does not remember anything.
There is no single reason that can explain this phenomenon.
Sometimes they are linked to other sleep disorders such as nightmares, nighttime fears, bedwetting (wetting in bed), or sleepwalking, but this is not necessarily the case.
As already mentioned, it can be associated with very high fever stages, situations of stress or overexcitement.
In any case, it is a phenomenon still little studied.
The intensity with which it appears is also extremely variable.
It can happen that the person speaks with a very calm tone of voice, with loose words, almost in a whisper or that the opposite happens (scream, screams, long speeches ...).
In cases where the event is particularly intense, it would be advisable to observe the child and possibly consult a specialist to check if there is any issue that is generating an abnormal state of anxiety as an outlet for the situation.
We have said that it is a benign alteration so there is no treatment unless it is associated with other sleep disorders that can be treated (for example, if coupled with insomnia or stress situation).
What you can do, however, is to take into account a series of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite your baby too much before he goes to sleep.
Propose quiet games and avoid programs or television series that arouse fear or suggest violence.
With very nervous children for whom it is tiring to relax, you can use relaxation techniques to help them acquire some inner calm.
This will allow the child to sleep more easily.
Once sleepwalkers appear try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will not remember anything that happened.
Useful tips
Don't wake him.
It is useless, because he is not aware of what is happening, and you would interrupt his sleep.
Although he is talking, he is sleeping and therefore he is resting.
Remember that if it appears very distressed and the episodes have a certain frequency, it is better to consult a doctor or check where such great anxiety in the child derives from.
If you understand what he says (which is not the most common situation), don’t fall into the temptation to interrogate him for information.
You will get nothing, because he is asleep and therefore not conscious to organize his thinking.
In addition, you are able to hear what it says but not to see what it is dreaming to say it, so you must pay close attention to the interpretation of the information and the conclusions to which it could lead.
Never tell your child that you might ask him questions during the night to learn his secrets.
Not even as a joke.
Such a thing causes enormous anguish.
In short, do not worry, it is nothing serious, it is an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
The Illhaeusern has finally found its way home after a long period of failure.
Without playing a formidable game, the Yellow-Blacks created the most chances from the net turning one into the victory of the game.
The pace was not very strong during this meeting in which the attackers expressed themselves with difficulty.
After a first attempt by the captain of the guest team Kauffmann who touched the seven with a shot from afar, the Illhaeusern began to win and one after another provoked the defense of Dannemarie, Fonderflick from afar, then Hirn high, Romain of point and again Diebold.
The Dannemarie responded with a block in the middle of the field, leaving only the unleashed Riahi in the lead.
The start of the second half was decisive with two initial chances signed Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the first goal of Marais for Illhaeusern, well positioned, recovered a rejected ball on a first attempt of Diebold (53').
But the Illhaeusern gunner will not be able to enjoy his happiness for long and will be expelled a dozen minutes later leaving his teammates outnumbered.
But the Dannemarie will not take advantage and will not pose great problems to the Eleven of the Illhaeusern, just back to "strengthen" the defense, except in the last minutes of play when, after a sensational action, the ball touched the crossbar.
Sarkozy meets with angry fishermen
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will stop in Brittany.
Ahead of the demonstration of the fishermen who brutally prevented access to several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the President of the Republic decided to go on Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in the department of Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re, to enchant its representatives.
The latter promised to welcome him "in a constructive spirit" and hope that "he will present himself with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit that takes place at the same time as the general assembly of the "crisis committee", created by the Breton fishermen in order to adopt measures to cope with the soaring price of diesel, which has reached its record with an average of more than 1.14 euros per liter.
According to the spokesman of the Elysee David Martinon, the president "will discuss with them the possible solutions to help companies regain competitiveness and to make safe the working conditions and the wages of sailors".
The fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy standing still.
On Tuesday morning, they conducted "snail operations" in Morbihan and Calvados, causing almost 10 km of traffic jams.
The port of Quiberon was also blocked, but connections to Belle-<0xC3><0xAE>le were not interrupted.
On the Quiberon peninsula a road blockade has been implemented.
On Monday, sailors have already shown their determination by burning, from dawn, tires and pallets in front of fuel depots at the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement extended to the ports of the Atlantic coast and the English Channel, such as Sables d'Olonne, in the Vendée, where the fishing boats remained at the pier, or to Havre, where about twenty boats prevented the movement of commercial vessels.
The fishermen of La Turballe et del Croisic, near the Loire Atlantic, interrupted in the evening the blockade of the well-known Total refinery of Donges.
In Boulogne-sur-Mer they decided to wait for the meeting to be held on Wednesday at the ministry to decide any actions.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" will decide on Tuesday the future actions of the movement and the possible participation in the meeting planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the heads of the National Fisheries Committee, which has not supported the movement.
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen will not give in" and "they have no intention of moving to Paris", announced, for example, Liliane Cariou, president of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, currently pay about 50 cents per litre, but estimate that the yield limit of a boat is only reached with diesel less than 0.30 euro per litre.
Paul Newman the Magnificent
The unforgettable Butch Cassidy actor died of cancer at the age of 83 at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes greeted film legend and committed actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
The Embraer maintains the delivery forecasts in 2008
The aircraft manufacturer is counting 215 deliveries this year, despite the threats of recession that weigh on the world economy.
Embraer, the world’s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer, maintains its delivery forecast for 2008 with the delivery of 215 aircraft, confirmed its president Fredrico Fleury Curado.
During the first half, it delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian company has great confidence in the Chinese market, in particular for aircraft in the range between 30 and 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 aircraft to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would divest more than 15 percent of its business.
The insurance company American International Group, revived by the US monetary authorities, would sell more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion loan, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is ready to consider the sale of most of its assets, in addition to the sale of the life insurance branches to the international market and the United States, the newspaper said on the basis of more than authoritative sources.
AIG’s board of directors met on Sunday evening to consider any divestitures, according to the FT.
No confirmation was obtained at AIG.
The assets AIG intends to divest include the aircraft leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and its investments in private equity, the FT adds.
No final decision has been taken on these divestments, the FT continues.
The AIG must find liquidity quickly in order to repay the $85 billion loan granted to it by the Federal Reserve, at the cost of the US authorities seizing 80% of its capital.
Paris: Timeline Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange suffered a historic crash on Monday, after the House of Representatives spoke out against the Paulson plan to rescue financial institutions: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a drop never seen, approaching 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) finished at 10,365.45, down 777.68 points.
In terms of points, the worst loss in its history (684.81 points) exceeded that of September 17, 2001, the day the stock exchanges reopened following the terrorist attacks of September 11.
The Nasdaq, the index of major technology stocks, lost 199.61 points to close at 1,983.73 and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 lost 8.81% (or 106.85 points) to close at 1,106.55, according to final closing figures.
Demoralized at the beginning of the session, Wall Street collapsed after the unexpected rejection of the rescue plan of the banks, designed to bring stability to the markets.
With 228 votes against the plan and 205 in favor, the representatives refused the funding requested by Treasury Minister Henry Paulson.
About two out of three Republicans rejected the plan.
“It’s a negative signal to the market that Congress is unable to adopt a plan,” said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
“All of this signals how much the market counted on the project,” he added, fearing that in a few days it might already be “too late” to adopt one.
“If the project were indeed moribund ... then the baton would be quickly passed to the Fed and other central banks to solve the crisis, which would further limit credit conditions,” said Brian Bethune, head of finance and economics at Global Insight.
And underlining the state of emergency, "every day that passes leads to the collapse of a financial institution" in the United States, stressed Piegza.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, authorities arranged for the purchase of Wachovia’s banking business by rival Citygroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated sharply, urging emergency intervention in favor of banks in the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that markets "are not only facing an American crisis, but a global crisis," added the analyst of FTN Financial.
The bond market has gone up sharply.
The yield on 10-year Treasury bills declined to 3.632% from 3.827% on Friday night, while the 30-year yield was 4.161% from 4.357% on the previous day.
Obama wins first televised duel
After the first debate on Friday between the two candidates in the White House, here is a second to know who, between John McCain and Barack Obama, was the winner.
Unsurprisingly, Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed the respective victory of the televised duel, followed by one-third of American families.
Political scientist David Gergen believes that John McCain’s performance, while deserving, was not bright enough to allow him to slow the decline in polls five weeks after the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, whose opinion poll released on Saturday gave Obama a five-point lead (49% vs. 44% for McCain), shows that the Democrat got the better of him.
An instant poll conducted by CBS News of a sample of undecided voters found that 39 percent of them believe Obama is the winner, while 25 percent point to McCain.
An excellent performance by his running mate Joe Biden, expected during the first and only debate with rival Sarah Palin, is expected to confirm Obama's lead on Thursday.
“Underestimating it would be a mistake.
He has good intuition,” Clinton warned this weekend.
The 70-year-old McCain has never stopped promoting his indisputable experience in foreign policy, underscoring the “na<0xC3><0xAF>veté” of the opponent regarding the topics addressed during the first face-to-face.
“Senator Obama doesn’t seem to understand that,” he often stated on multiple occasions.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the experience and expertise to become president,” he said.
What has been a constant target for the Republican television campaign since yesterday.
Obama, for his part, stressed that his election would represent a new future.
Without procrastinating, it proved to be concise and precise.
He promoted his predisposition to the right decisions and the intention to restore the image of the United States on the world stage.
“McCain never understood, unlike Obama,” a Democratic ad retorted over the weekend, reprimanding the Republican for failing to take the necessary steps to address the impact of the financial crisis on the American people.
During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you, Obama denounced yesterday, in front of 20,000 people gathered in North Carolina, in a pouring rain, for an electoral meeting.
He did not even utter the words "middle class" or "workers". The financial crisis is in favor of Obama, considered by Americans as the most suitable person to save the economy on the edge of the precipice.
“Next week could be a decisive turning point,” said Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, likened Obama’s economic insight to that demonstrated by Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
The current collapse is the final verdict after eight years of bad economic policy adopted by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain.
Reiterating his intention to reduce taxes for 95 percent of Americans despite the Wall Street scares, the Illinois senator also mentioned the achievement of the country’s eventual energy independence through the promotion of renewable energy and the implementation of a health insurance system as his priorities.
McCain, for his part, would build a park of 45 nuclear centers by 2030.
Prudently, the two candidates dodged questions centered on the $700 billion ($470 billion) financial rescue plan adopted last night by Congress and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "didn't you notice that there were elections?"
Young people and opponents demonstrated on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to contest in advance the results of the legislative elections.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening immediately after polling stations were closed in Minsk’s central square to protest the fraudulent nature of the legislative elections.
While they were still waiting for the results, many young people had come to demonstrate against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko: "the dictator, resignation".
Some confess that they did not even vote: "What for? They will do what they want, of my vote," says a boy.
They do not believe that the regime that has made a good impression before foreign observers with the aim of resuming dialogue with the European Union is ready to take a democratic turn.
Sanctions, including a visa ban for 40 Belarusian officials and asset freezes, could be lifted if these elections are deemed legitimate by observers.
They were not, according to the opposition.
"We have been removed from the electoral commissions and our observers have not been able to participate in the vote counting," said Yury Potemkin, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous alliance of twelve parties.
"It's a change of facade," said Alexandre Milinkievich, a former candidate of the opposition to the 2006 presidential elections and leader of the pro-European movement, because the important thing is who counts the cards and in this case is the executive.
If members of the opposition enter Parliament, it is because they have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament can involve a TV space, regional meetings and bills.”
The opposition therefore has a duty to enter the political game because "dialogue with the European Union must be initiated.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, goes into crisis, and we do not provide any reforms, we risk becoming a Russian protectorate.
Now we want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the security and cooperation organisation in Europe that followed the election process will recognise the validity of the vote.
He points out that the turnout seems too high, and that the generalization of early voting (26% of voters in Minsk) has given rise to all kinds of manipulation.
"Have you not noticed that there were elections? asks the social-democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released this year, in August.
There was no one at the polling stations.
And there will have been at most five opposition MPs in parliament, the most convenient in power.”
The night silence falls on the October square.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Commission are pleased with their success.
The meeting - Blood is safe again
Héma-Québec celebrated the tenth anniversary of its founding yesterday, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to rejoice, as Héma-Québec has become one of the safest and most effective blood providers in the world.
And above all, it has regained the trust of the public, seriously shaken by the scandal of infected blood in the years between 1980 and 1990.
As we know, the national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were infected with acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C in the 1980s.
In the face of such tragedy and public outcry, the Government of Canada conducted a public inquiry in February 1994, directed by Judge Horace Krever, which aimed to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations to prevent a similar disaster from reoccurring.
While Judge Krever was late in drawing up a report, some provinces set up a committee with the aim of devising a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, this mandate was carried out by the Gélineau committee.
Following the Gélineau et Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Héma-Québec to supply Québec and Société canadienne du sang (Canadian Blood Corporation) for all other provinces and two territories.
In 1998, when Héma-Québec started its activities, only 38% of people said they still had confidence in the donation system in Quebec, recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was mortifying.
Thanks to continuous efforts to improve the safety of blood samples and field research over the following years, we have regained the trust of the public," she explains before proudly stating that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of the population of Quebec now had confidence in Héma-Québec.
However, Dr. Décary is convinced that "trust is something extremely fragile".
Since its creation on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At the time, there were numerous cases in Europe of the human variant of the mad cow, a new manifestation of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says the one who has been in the presidency since 1998, the year of its foundation.
“And we didn’t know at all if that disease could be transmitted through infected blood.
It was therefore based on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélinau reports, according to which when there are doubts and a serious disease could result, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which manifests itself with a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, exclusion measures are adopted.
In April 1999, the blood of those who had spent more than a month in the UK since 1980 was rejected.
Now, for some years, it has been proven that without any doubt this disease is transmitted through infected blood.
This incident showed us that it made sense to apply the precautionary principle."
In 1999, a much more efficient technique for the detection of HIV appeared on the market: nucleic acid tests (NAT) that make it possible to recognize directly in the blood of donors the presence of the virus and not that of antibodies against it, on which the tests used until then were based.
The TANs have made it possible to reduce the window period, that is, from the moment when the person has contracted the disease to the one in which the first viruses can be detected in the blood thanks to our techniques, explains the specialist.
That period could be reduced to less than a week.
The risk of ignoring the presence of infected donors and not being able to identify them has thus decreased considerably.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS with a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of receiving blood infected with the HIV virus.
“In other words, this means that you will need to distribute 12 million blood samples before someone is infected with the HIV virus.
Since Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood samples every year, it will take more than 24 years for a case of HIV transmitted by transfusion to be found.
I believe that today you can feel comfortable receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to recover your health, says the head of the management of Héma-Québec.
“Our challenge for the next decade is to keep our products safe.
You never know which pathogen will emerge in the system.
No later than a year ago the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted in the blood by an insect.
You have to be constantly vigilant," continues Dr. Décary before stressing that in addition to having secure resources, Héma-Québec must also provide enough.
“Needs are increasing as the population ages.
As cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need a supply of red blood cells or platelets.
The aging of the population also has consequences on the number of donors, which on average constitutes only 3% of the inhabitants of Quebec acceptable as donors.
However, all healthy people who have reached the age of 18 and meet the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who offer themselves as donors are not accepted, because they are affected by AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have traveled to a country where the latter is widespread, they will be rejected for a period of one year.
“With this 3%, we are able to maintain an inventory capable of meeting the needs of hospitals.
Shortages are very rare.
But it is necessary to renew the members of this group of donors as they get older and can no longer make donations.
It is now difficult to convince people to donate blood, but above all to hold them back and encourage them to become regular donors.
Nowadays life is so hectic that you can hardly find an hour to donate blood,” says Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec distributes not only blood samples, but also human tissues, including bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that is used almost exclusively for severe burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being deposited with Héma-Québec, which operates the only public cord blood bank in Quebec.
In the umbilical cord, which was once considered a biomedical waste, there is an abundance of blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"A few weeks ago, we celebrated the introduction of our 1,000th cord blood sample into the bank, and we plan to collect more than 1,000 cord blood samples each year.
You should start proposing them for transplants early next year," says Dr. Décary who describes this practice of cord blood sampling as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed that they cannot have access to it," because Héma-Québec does not have the means to offer this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Football - L'Impact in the semifinals
Impact Montréal qualified for the semifinals of the Serie A qualifiers, winning 3-1 against the Seattle Sounders yesterday during a decisive second quarterfinal match at the Saputo Stadium.
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro, scored the decisive goal in the 90'.
After a goalless first half on both sides, David Testo and Rocco Placentino scored the next goals for Montreal.
For the Sounders, Roger Levesque was quick to score Matt Jordan.
The Impact suffered a 2-1 loss at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila on the outskirts of Seattle on Friday.
The Impact will face the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semifinals.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, Thundler clinched the first 3-1 in the return leg by winning 4-3, but the Whitecaps will still make it to the semifinals.
The Impact will face the Whitecaps on both Friday and Sunday, but more details will be confirmed later in the day.
In brief - Kovalev's decisive network
The Canadiens and their aces are ready to start the season again.
The trio of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn animated the offensive phase of the game by winning 3-2 against the Panthers, Florida, last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the star of the first game, scored a goal, made two passes, and picked up a pass for the win, in the fourth of the Hab's preseason games.
The only net signed by Kovalev was decisive for the victory.
“I’m not ready yet,” the Russian said.
I need another game to feel comfortable.”
“He tried to overdo it in the first period,” noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the outcome of the game.
There was a good ovation."
Charest Point to the North
The Prime Minister does not rule out the start of elections before the end of the year.
At the conclusion of the general council of the Liberal Party, Jean Charest went yesterday to Jean-Talon, in Quebec where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc, (left), is trying to get elected in today’s by-election.
"Broadening the boundaries of our last great northern frontier": this is the long-term ambition of Jean Charest, presented yesterday in Levis, by means of tools with a strong visual impact, on the occasion of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec.
Behind him, during his speech, the projection of a sort of "image mill".
On three maxi screens, spectacular negatives of hydroelectric dams, mining crops, images of Quebec seen with "Google Maps", maps, etc. were confused.
It’s as big as in the middle of the election campaign.
During the press conference, moreover, the prime minister refused to rule out the start of the autumn elections, although he noted that he was very busy.
The "Northern Plan" is the fourth point of a "project" that the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes a first agreement with France on labor, a second agreement between Canada and Europe and other agreements with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the prime minister’s most recent speeches, the opening of the North – the northern territory at the 49th parallel – had never been the subject of a presentation.
The prime minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North would be "a jewel with immense potential", but did not comment on timing or investment quotas, as well as did not explain what the precise priorities will be in the realization of future projects.
At the very least, it has limited itself to pointing out what, in its opinion, deserves a priority position: hydropower, forests, but above all the mining sector, which, following the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure, has experienced several improvements.
According to the list drawn up by Charest, the North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds".
That "territory twice the size of France" is here, it's Quebec.
Not only is it here, but it is inherent in us,” he insisted, as if to urge a national founding myth.
The foundations of Quebec are rooted in its relationship with the North, he stressed: the gold fever in Abitibi, national engineering, James Bay.
“It’s up to us, it’s our future,” he added, after a theatrical break to contemplate the immense map behind him.
The North, 70% of the territory of Quebec, includes a part of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, said the Prime Minister during the press conference.
"It is a position traditionally held by all governments.
“There is a boundary line on which no agreement has been in place for a long time, and when the opportunity arises, I will reiterate that position in the name of the government,” he said.
“Considering climate change, we need to re-evaluate the North,” he said, referring to the Northwest Passage, which will be open year-round due to melting ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister believes that occupying the territory is a duty.”
What about the locals, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would be very careful about this and that the project would meet their interests, especially those of young people.
Two former ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former deputy of the PQ d'Ungava), have already started the consultation of about thirty communities.
An inter-ministerial committee chaired by Beno<0xC3><0xAE>t Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) holds an important position, has started work.
The prime minister does not rule out a big meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a time when "common visions will be provided"
The development of the North would also adhere to the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be "concerted, orderly and respectful of the environment," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "project" as a continuum with that of the Liberal prime ministers who preceded it.
“Like the liberals who came before us, we know how to distinguish ourselves in order to transform challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.”
This was also one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a large cocktail in honor of the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival at the head of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Beauharnois power station the Adélard-Godbout Dam.
“From Godbout, creator of Hydro-Québec, to Lesage who nationalized hydroelectricity, to Bourassa, creator of James Bay, our party has always been able to forge the future,” said Jean Charest.
During the press conference, he resorted to another reference, conservative this time, the program "Roads to the North" by John Diefenbaker, prime minister from 1957 to 1963.
Addressing the project related to the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam, Charest specified that its commissioning would be scheduled for 2012.
“All this remains between us, but I feel that we will do it,” he confessed to his militants, arousing heartfelt applause.
In fact, the prime minister, who in April claimed there would be no elections in 2008 and probably not even in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of starting a poll in the autumn, which could happen in accordance with the law.
He stresses that he is certainly very busy, especially in a mission of the federal council in China and in the Quebec-New York summit.
The weekend’s General Council provided the Liberal leader with a platform for nationalist resolutions, in particular “constitutional aspirations” that have gone as smoothly as oil: the PLQ calls above all for recognition of the “specificity of Quebec” in the Constitution.
He also hoped that Quebec would appoint members of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Council and that the latter would have a right of veto over decisions taken in Quebec.
As for the opposition, the draft of the Northern Plan was met with scepticism.
The leader of the PQ, Pauline Marois, has dusted off the Northern Quebec Development Policy launched by the Landry government in 2001.
According to her, the Liberal government, which came to power in 2003, would not have respected its application.
Had she done so, "we would have made progress today," Marois said alongside Jean-Talon candidate Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Mercure.
The ADQ said it supported the government's adoption of the North Plan.
"What we hope is that all this is not simply perceived as a show," commented leader Sébastien Proulx, Mario Dumont's replacement, returning today from the holidays.
Letters - A Dishonored Country
It was Vic Toews, the former minister of Justice (irony of fate) in the Harper cabinet, who allowed himself to declare last summer that Louise Arbor was a "shame" on Canada.
To dishonour in this way a woman who has fought unceasingly for justice and who deserves all our admiration says a lot both about the Prime Minister's entourage and about Stephen Harper himself.
Here we are before a government that is the only one, of all the Western countries involved, that has not repatriated one of its citizens detained in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that does not take into account at all the fact that Omar Khadr was a mere teenager at the time of the events imputed to him.
The only government that, despite having signed the Geneva Convention, denies its word and lets a child-soldier rot in inhumane conditions.
The only one who trusts in a travesty of justice to establish the guilt of the accused.
For information purposes, UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, in particular, are calling for the repatriation of Omar Khadraffin so that he can undergo a regular trial in Canada.
It is the same government that closes its eyes to torture: it cares very little that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, perhaps forever, after so many years of abuse.
We do not yet realize it, but we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, freedom and "democracy," a word that Harper never ceases to flaunt and that sounds so senseless on his lips.
Here we are at the moment when there is no longer any morality: you can mistreat, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen according to the discretion of a head of government until now minority (to see what will be after October 14 ...).
Many voters believe that a party that preaches Virtue, Respect for Law and Order represents salvation: they do not see that this government has renounced what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
Therein lies the shame, Mr. Toews, in giving up all this, and nowhere else.
The Orwellian Discourse of Barrick Gold
In the September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from M. Patrick J. Garver, vice-president director of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Pursuing an Orwellian logic, the latter states that the world’s largest gold company has filed a six-million-dollar defamation suit against three authors and a small penniless publishing house with the intention of initiating a “transparent public debate.”
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of a defamation lawsuit, but the law.
Unsurprisingly, this substantial difference is completely hidden by Garver.
For Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to bring to ruin anyone who dares to take a position contrary to its own.
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the writers and publisher of the book Black Canada will have to spend a hefty sum of money in order to organize their own defense and fight, with decidedly odd weapons, against an army of lawyers financed from the virtually bottomless pockets of the mining company.
Moreover, in these odd-arms fights, the tactic is often to ruin the defendant in order to impose a consensual settlement that stifles opposition as well as scare anyone who dares to speak out on the issue again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it is before the public that it should have presented its view of the facts.
Contrary to what happens in many countries where Barrick Gold works, in Canada the debates are usually held with the exchange of opinions and not with truncheons.
It would therefore have been enough for the company to open its books, its documents, and establish a real debate, through newspapers, media, publications and the funding of teams of independent researchers who could shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to have much confidence in public opinion and rejects petitions and letters in support of the authors of Black Canada.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he can ask for a "public" debate when his contempt for that same audience is quite evident?
In the world of the vice-president, it seems that this word refers only to high-paid lawyers and not to all Canadians; here is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In a democratic system, even denigrators have the right to speak.
What Barrack Gold doesn’t understand – or doesn’t want to understand – is that the public that supports the authors and publishers of Black Canada does so primarily because it rejects the brutal means adopted by the mining company.
This public is ready to listen to Barrick and to judge, but on the basis of civil exchanges of opinion, and not in view of what many perceive as a kind of gag (by seeking "public debate", Barrick Gold has just given the authors of Black Canada an ultimatum ordering them to suspend the use of that word...)
Beyond Garver’s surreal speech, the lawsuit filed by Barrack Gold constitutes a direct attack on the freedom of university research and the pursuit of truth, indispensable in any democratic society.
It denies en bloc the right to quote authentic sources and to debate on facts and interpretations, which represent the very basis of intellectual work.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to study and argue about uncomfortable topics to the richest companies in the world, under penalty of multiple lawsuits, who will be able to do it?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could do so by following scientific standards as the authors of Black Canada do.
You have the right of reply.
For a long time, the university environment, of which we are a part, has been able to handle debates and disagreements and to resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's excessive measures clearly show that, contrary to its claims, it does not seek a transparent debate at all.
This is to the detriment of the university world, as is the public debate in Canada itself, and it is time for governments to take measures to curb abusive lawsuits.
Operation - Rescue for Wall Street - Dialogue between Republicans and Democrats
The Bush administration and the leaders of Congress, representatives of the Republican and Democratic parties, yesterday finally reached an agreement on the largest bailout since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan, which aims to curb the financial crisis that has plagued Wall Street for months, has yet to be ratified by both houses of Congress.
In particular, it provides for: checks on its actual implementation by elected leaders, new mechanisms guaranteeing the reimbursement of public money, new provisions to contain the number of houses seized for non-payments, as well as a right to inspect the remuneration paid to the managers of the protected companies.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Republican Representative to the negotiating table Senator Judd Gregg announced the good news minutes after midnight on Monday after a two-day marathon of negotiations.
“We have made great progress toward an effective agreement on markets,” said Bush Administration Representative Henry Paulson.
“Every decision has been made in such a way as to safeguard the economy and the American people from the current crisis on Wall Street,” he said.
“This is the crux of the matter: If we didn’t act this way, priceless heartbreak and turmoil would be spilling over into the daily lives of Americans,” said Rep. Judd Gregg, R-Texas.
The conclusion of the negotiations was marked by concerns about the impact of a new bankruptcy on investors.
The deadline agreed was the opening of the markets this morning.
Joining the negotiations later, the two US presidential candidates were quite supportive of the agreement, but did not avoid expressing their displeasure at the adoption of extreme solutions.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama is credited with adding some provisions to the agreement, in particular the one that will allow owners to keep their homes and the one related to salaries for executives of companies covered by the state.
“When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of others, there is nothing to rejoice about.
But these measures are necessary," he said on the American television screen.
Interviewed on another channel to see if he would vote for the plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied: "I would like to analyze the details, but I hope so."
“From what I’ve read, this is something that we all need to digest and that will allow us to move forward.”
The option of non-intervention is simply unacceptable,” he said.
The $700 billion plan aims to buy back with taxpayers’ money the dubious, risky and unsaleable assets of American financial institutions.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis due to the bursting of a real estate bubble that led first to the collapse of risky mortgage loans (mortgages), then to extend to other more widespread forms of credit securities (PCAA) and result in the freezing of liquidity and the abandonment of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republicans in office who blew up the first draft of a deal last week.
It seems to have come out of that dead end since the Democrats accepted that the "toxic" assets of some struggling companies are only protected by the government, rather than purchased.
In order to meet everyone in Congress, a provision has been added that if the government were to face losses over the next five years as a result of such a program, it could impose new taxes in order to maintain its balance.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion to which can be added another 100 billion if the president deems it necessary.
The $350 billion payment is expected to be ratified by a further vote of Congress.
In exchange for its help, Washington will get stakes in the protected companies that will earn it dividends in case of profit and that it can resell when the waters have calmed.
According to the plan, the federal government will have the possibility to delay foreclosure procedures related to real estate loans and to establish limits on the remuneration and severance pay paid to the managers of the companies involved.
As of today, the architects of the plan would like to put it to the vote of the House of Representatives, and to the vote of the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will be given the green light.
In fact, yesterday there were several votes against the project, both in the Republican and Democratic ranks.
“Evidently, Washington doesn’t hear you,” Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee, told his constituents.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
Not taking advantage of taxpayers.
Leader of a small group in Congress dubbed the “Skeptics Caucus,” Democratic Representative Brad Sherman presents the situation differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred eminent economics professors, including three Nobel Laureates, have written to us to say: We ask Congress not to jump to conclusions and to carefully consider the way forward,” he said.
At the same time, in Europe, we were once again witnessing the test of the global nature of the crisis.
After an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros ($16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary when the French bank BNS Paribas announced that it would give up the purchase of its competitor, in full bankruptcy after the loss of 2 billion euros (2.9 billion dollars) for the crisis of real estate loans at risk in the United States.
Fortis has 85,000 employees and is part of Europe's 20 largest banks and 10 largest insurers.
"It is not money lost," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said on Monday.
In return, they collect influence and voting rights in banking matters.
It’s certainly something that savers and families appreciate now that times are uncertain.”
During this period, at the other end of the Channel, the British government appears to be nationalizing another bank teetering on the brink of financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take over all the loans currently in progress at the Bradford and Bringley bank, of which more than 41 billion (75.5 billion dollars) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it will buy the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
Since the beginning of the economic crisis, Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank, after Northern Rock, to undergo a process of nationalization by the British government.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a committed icon
The blue-eyed beauty was for a long time his ace in the sleeve, for others his weak spot.
Did he get rid of the narcissistic mirror, the American actor with the bewitching smile?
Yes and no.
His discretion, sensitivity and obvious talent would have expelled him from that circle of powerful consecrated to real sacred monsters.
What constancy!
Paul Newman, who died Friday at the age of 83 on his Connecticut ranch from lung cancer, remains one of the last icons of American cinema in years gone by.
Less monumental than Brando, to whom he resembled and of whom he was for a long time a sort of rival on the screen, more cautious in his game, certainly more fragile, but he also spoke for freedom and the development of dramatic convictions.
From mixed couples are often born magical children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, to a German Jewish father and mother of Hungarian origins.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
A humble ego, the ultimate mark of quality.
Since he recognized himself as a country enthralled by the safe made man, the fighter of the Pacific war, proud in combat, who in the early 50s studied drama at Yale, he subsequently attended the Actor Studio in New York, before triumphing in the theater, on television and soon at the cinema.
That same civil rights activist was also the car driver who placed second at the 24 Hours of Mans in 1979, as well as a sex symbol, although part of a model couple since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
The shadows of a star reserved, discreet, committed, allergic to the scandals of show-business, whose mystery will never be completely revealed, leave with him.
An honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
This weekend, Paul Newman’s passing was a heart-wrenching experience for cinephiles, as his great characters populate the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of American cinema in full transformation is proposed through its interpretations.
Butch Cassidy's fascinating cowboy (1969) and the man who can't get enough of his hot wife (Elizabeth Taylor) merge in memory in The Cat on the Hot Roof adapted by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
More recently, we remember him as the sensitive Mr. Bridge (1990), troubled by a marriage that did not keep what was promised.
So many other Paul Newmans have gone down in history.
The boxer Rocky Graziano, delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Up There Someone Loves Me, by Robert Wise, a role intended for James Dean and resumed after his death, which officially launched Newman in 1956.
That cute villain in the excellent Stangata, Oscar for best film in 1973.
Bitter and vengeful billiard player in Robert Rossen's magnificent film Lo Spaccone (1961), The Color of Money by Martin Scorsese, which earned him in 1987 the only Oscar out of 9 nominations.
That face through the years, it was hers.
Him again.
The ages follow each other through its path.
Young people know him especially for the cult movie Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), in the role of Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994’s Mr. Hula Hoop by the Coen brothers.
The circle had closed with one last role as godfather of the Irish mafia in My Father's Day, 2003.
Unlike the highest-profile film legends who soon abandoned the craft, Newman would remain in theaters for a long time, denouncing Hollywood in all its glitz, parties and concessions.
Bertrand Tavernier, a French amateur filmmaker, defined it, with a touch of irony, "a living challenge to underplaying", judging its performance exaggerated.
The profession was not always a game for the handsome Paul Newman, to whom the roles seemed to fall like manna from the sky.
However, he often preferred the role of the outcast to that of the young actor: neurotic characters, drunken carrion or desperate, of which he expressed disarray and rebellion with his perfect traits.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown nuances of his true, modest sensibility.
Jennifer’s first time, in 1968 (based on the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), with her wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, drew a subtle female portrait of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott to an overdose, dedicated to him in 1984 the film Harry and Son, discreet and sad film.
Among the countless tributes rained yesterday on Newman, his great friend and old comrade-in-arms Robert Redford (they had starred together in The Hangover and Butch Cassidy) said with infinite sadness "His presence has made my life and this country better".
Generosity and love for life, two great characteristics of the late actor.
Beyond a career as a legend, he dies a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a protester of Hollywood drift.
We will have seen her face stand out on bottles of vinegar, sauces, cookies and other foods, judging her a choice of bad taste, although born as a gag.
However, the proceeds from those sales went to his Foundation for Children in Need.
Newman, instead of dwelling on his myth, chose to commit to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter that read, “Always and to the end, your father has been incredibly grateful to his good star.
Being there was a privilege.”
And it was also a privilege for us to follow the path of such a clear and generous American artist.
Citizen model, then, and much more.
What was produced in the invoice factory of Zuschlag & Soci?
Shortly, on October 8, the hearing of the criminal trial against János Zuschlag and associates will be discussed.
The politician and his associates are accused of repeated commercial fraud committed within a criminal association that has caused considerable damage, and of other crimes, including forgery of documents.
According to the Prosecutor's Office, the money obtained from tenders was used by them for private purposes, and they often certified the performance of the activities through false invoices.
The state and municipal money, totaling 65 million florins, ended up partly in the coffers of the Fiatal Baloldal organization, partly in the pockets of some people.
According to the method, made known by the investigating authorities, they have withdrawn the money obtained from tenders on the basis of invoices for non-existent operations and the associations have never fulfilled the obligations assumed.
According to the indictment, most of the invoices were false.
To make them, the blocks of invoices were purchased at the market of J<0xC3><0xB3>zsefváros, the circular stamps instead were manufactured in Kiskunhalas.
And to decide on behalf of which companies to issue invoices, it was established among other things during the trip through the hills above the Balaton where János Zuschlag had sent István Lados.
According to the latter's confession he had to choose pensions and restaurants.
He asked for an invoice for the consumptions, on the model of these then the invoices were prepared to be forwarded to the calls for competition, among others, to those of the Ministry for Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and the Municipality of Budapest.
Most of these are the work of István Lados and András <0xC5><0x90>ri, who, according to our information, have drawn up the reports necessary to obtain the funding.
One of the choices of the "study trip" of Lados was a brewery.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and partners in 2003, the restaurant provided meals for a group of 90 people of the Biztos Pont Egyes<0xC3><0xBC>let Association.
So many people, however, according to the restaurateur, would not all enter the room together.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 to the Jobb J<0xC3><0xB6>v<0xC5><0x91>ért Foundation, later called Egy<0xC3><0xBC>tt a Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért, is riddled with formal and content errors.
A guesthouse in Badacsonytomaj has only three rooms, more than 10 people could not stay overnight, however in the bill there were 130 guests.
But the compilers of the invoices full of fantasy exaggerated when they reported the Pigal Kft., this one also deals with catering, in whose accounting - according to the information released to the judicial authorities - the documents on behalf of the companies Jobb J<0xC3><0xB6>v<0xC5><0x91>ért and Hoppá did not even appear.
Gy<0xC5><0x91>z<0xC5><0x91> Farkas, the company’s director, told hvg.hu that when he was summoned to the prosecutor’s office and shown the invoices, he immediately understood that they were fake documents.
"On the stamp the name and VAT number of our company were in the wrong place."
He added: In addition to the formal reasons, the fact that according to the invoice a hundred people were accommodated, when in total they have eleven rooms and there are not so many beds.
In addition, the bill was for catering and their restaurant has not been in operation for a long time.
The assiduous compilers of invoices did not bother to inform themselves that the Budapest travel agency of their choice, only organizes trips abroad, so they foolishly indicated on the invoice with payment in cash trips to Hungary, which did not agree with the practice of issuing invoices of the company.
In addition, as demonstrated during the survey, the invoice also included VAT, while the activity of travel to countries outside the European Union is exempt from VAT.
Among other things, the amount of VAT was also incorrect on the four documents issued by the Hotel Révf<0xC3><0xBC>l<0xC3><0xB6>p Kft. in favor of the Jobb J<0xC3><0xB6>v<0xC5><0x91>ért foundation, in fact on the services offered by the company it is necessary to apply the VAT at 15% and not at 25% as indicated on the invoices, in addition the employees of the hotel only issued printed invoices, while the invoice was written.
In addition to this, the "issuers" ruined other invoices, in the case of a company they indicated as activity carried out the transport of goods by road, as it is known from the procedure of the Prosecutor, activity that was not carried out by the company originally founded for investment advice.
In addition, due to formal defects - non-compliant invoice format, false stamp - it was discovered that the invoices issued in favor of Egy<0xC3><0xBC>tt to Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tvány, of XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyes<0xC3><0xBC>let and Biztos Pont are false.
The same happened in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehért<0xC3><0xB3> Sports Field, whose representatives denied having issued the invoices in question.
The counterfeiters did not pay attention to the fact that the HIB Kft. of Ny<0xC3><0xAD>regyháza was in liquidation when (2001) a group of Fiatal Városért Egyes<0xC3><0xBC>let had lunch there, precisely for this reason the curator of the liquidation of the company, according to our information, denied that he had issued that invoice.
Issued Invoices Consciously
Another group of invoice issuers consists of those who were aware of having to issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tvány Foundation issued an invoice at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifj<0xC3><0xBA> Szocialisták in favour of the Egy<0xC3><0xBC>tt Foundation in Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért of almost 4 million florins.
Ludovic Gy<0xC3><0xB6>rfi, one of the defendants, according to the indictment, persuaded the director of Collab Kft. to issue fictitious invoices.
Together with Zuschlag and partners, Biogate Kft, which is currently in liquidation, also collaborated, providing invoices in 2003 worth about 5 million florins to the Jobb J<0xC3><0xB6>v<0xC5><0x91>ért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tvány foundation, the Atlasz Egyes<0xC3><0xBC>let association and the V<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>sfeny<0xC5><0x91> Egyes<0xC3><0xBC>let economic association, behind which there was no real business.
Neither movement of money because the prepared invoices were then reversed, but the associations forgot to include this aspect in their documents.
In the following group of companies issuing invoices belong those who are connectable with the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov, authorized to the address of the director general of Delta Tri<0xC3><0xB3> Kft, based in Budapest but not available there, which deals with fuel and motor vehicle trade.
The company issued various invoices in October, November and December 2005 relating to the sale of computer media, for a value of about 18 million florins.
According to the investigation data, Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas under liquidation since 14 September 2005 purchased these invoices.
The general director of this company was a Romanian to whom between 2002 and 2005 Ivan Kubatov would forward the documents concerning the company.
As far as we know, during the investigation Kubatov acknowledged that he had issued invoices on behalf of the company to the companies Atlasz, Hoppá and Egy<0xC3><0xBC>tt in Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tvány and the countervalue was taken from him.
At the express request of Ivan Kubatov Romanian masons founded the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
However, none of the companies were operational, because according to the defendant they had not received work.
In any case, the companies were useful to him because at the request of the co-defendant lawyer Zsolt Szente, editor of the founding documents of the companies, in the name of the companies invoices were issued to the associations linked to Zuschlag: to the Atlasz and to the Y-Generaci<0xC3><0xB3>.
On behalf of the Cash Investment companies, Delta Tri<0xC3><0xB3>, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade Kubatov issued 15 invoices to the various entities for a total value of 14.2 million guilders.
Prosecutors believe that Kubatov pocketed 10% of the amounts indicated on the invoices, as well as VAT.
The man also used the Szi-Beri Bt. to issue fictitious invoices, manufactured for the Biztos Pont competition notice.
Y-Generáci<0xC3><0xB3> and Sz<0xC3><0xB6>vetség at Modern Magyarországért in January 2006 presented a call for tenders for the Socialist Party's public utility, Táncsics Mihály Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tvány (TMA).
They also won 500,000 florins each but the sums were not used for the purposes indicated in the announcement.
In order for this not to come to the surface, they presented five fictitious invoices received by the Works Team Kft to the TMA.
These invoices were found during the search of <0xC3><0x81>rpád Kemecsei's office at the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing a part of the defendants, as they have already done at the prosecutor's office, will probably report on the progress of the production of the invoices.
However, the most interesting thing might be whether defendant number one, János Zuschlag, would decide to lift the veil on everything.
His confession so far has not been very detailed and although he has promised several times to talk about everything in an extensive way, he has not yet done so.
It is necessary to see if it is in his interest, it could also be that the socialists have made agreements with Zusi, who - in exchange for compensation of 50 million florins, much of the damage - would be willing to make the scapegoat.
Zuschlag could also have been offended by the fact that his demands for the easing of his conditions of imprisonment, i.e. the granting of house arrest, have so far not been met.
While the perpetrators of non-compensable commercial crimes and causing much greater damage can freely walk or at least wait at home for the end of the proceedings against them, which is not granted to him.
The psychology of overbidding: why spend more money?
At auctions buyers are inclined to spend more, to overvalue the goods.
Neurologists and economists at New York University have been able to uncover the neuro-economic underpinnings of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to their study that appeared in the journal Science, men don’t want to be left behind in a race such as eBay’s auction, so they are willing to pay a higher price as well.
The research sought to trace the nervous pattern of this "match" at the level of the nervous system through experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers played the lotto, the other group of players participated in an auction while using the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) method they examined the active areas of the brain of the people participating in the experiment.
In both games participants could win some money, but in the auction game, where the substantial element is to bid more than the other, the body streaked under the cerebral cortex intensively comes into operation when you lose the game.
This brain area, in addition to other functions, plays a role in the “self-gratification” mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, according to the researchers, the rise in the price is explained by avoiding the vehement reaction of the striatum.
To support their theory, the economists of the research group carried out a financial tracking investigation.
In this survey, three groups bid against one partner under different conditions.
To the control group they reported how much was the real value of the product in question and they made their bet.
To another group in addition to this they promised that in case of winning they will receive another prize of 15 dollars.
The third group would receive $15 before the auction, but the members of the group would lose the money in case of loss at the auction.
The difference between the two groups consisted in the fact that for one of them the win was emphasized, while for the other the loss.
By testing the neurologists’ hypothesis, the members of the group playing “against the loss” were willing to make higher bets than the control or “winning” group.
“These results are not deducible from any of the previously existing economic theories.
These in fact until now explained the phenomena found at auctions with the joy of winning and with the avoidance of risk.
Only neurological imaging methods have helped resolve the contradiction between the two theories, so we have come to a third explanation,” said Andrew Schotter, a professor at New York University’s School of Economics.
Hepatitis: when to go to the doctor?
Almost half a billion people in the world suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, in Hungary instead among the leading causes of death are mentioned chronic liver diseases.
In Hungary the number of hepatitis patients amounts to one hundred thousand, of these only 7000 are treated: the reason is that many patients do not know they are infected.
The definition of hepatitis is the collective name of contagious liver diseases caused by different viruses.
There are many similarities between the symptoms, typical are hepatitis and jaundice, but their pathogens and the diseases caused differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses spread in two main forms depending on the pathogen: hepatitis A and E through the alimentary canal (e.g. water and infected food), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body fluids (sperm, vaginal discharge, saliva).
For those who travel it is useful to get vaccinated against virus A and B, against C there is no vaccine.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after consumption of infected foods, accompanied by general malaise, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After yellowish spots form on the skin and whites of the eyes, the stools become clear and the urine dark, healing takes place within two to three weeks.
One million people die each year worldwide from hepatitis B, the most severe variant of the disease, which causes liver tumors and cirrhosis of the liver.
The main reason is, according to estimates, that only one in ten people receive drug treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if left untreated, it can cause liver cirrhosis and liver cancer.
Most infected people do not know they have the disease because the pathogens subtly destroy the liver cells, in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
Therefore, it is very important to prevent and carry out regular medical tests.
This disease is much more common than the average in three groups: those who had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts and tattooed.
Worldwide, the number of people infected with chronic hepatitis C virus is 200 million.
Since even a routine laboratory examination reveals the disease it is worth turning to the family doctor when you notice any symptoms of unknown origin.
Recognized in time the disease is curable, the virus can be eliminated from the body, so the infectious power ceases and the formation of tumors can be prevented.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, first organized in 2004 around the world by patient associations.
The aim is to draw attention to chronic viral hepatitis, the causes of its development and early recognition of the disease.
Who believes in God feels less pain?
According to the result of a recent survey, religious faith functions as a kind of analgesic that has made the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
Scientists at the University of Oxford have carried out an interesting experiment, examining how faith in God affects the feeling of pain, the British Telegraph reported.
As part of the rather bizarre investigation, 12 Catholic believers and as many atheists were electroshocked, while all of them observed a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to fend off much of the pain.
Thanks to the exploratory technique of the human brain it was discovered that Catholics were able to activate the part of the brain responsible for pain control.
The test is the first in a series of research in which in addition to academics also scientists, philosophers and theologians of the University take part.
The test went exactly like this: an instrument that emits shocks and passes the electroshock was attached to the experimenter’s left hand.
The researchers asked participants to focus on two paintings, the Virgin Mary painted in the 17th century by Sassoferrato and the Lady with the Ermine by Leonardo da Vinci painted in the 15th century.
The authors of the examination hoped that the image of the Virgin Mary originated a sort of religious state among believers, while the painting of Leonardo was chosen because it did not differ too much from the other and they considered it to have a calming effect.
The subjects of the experiment spent half an hour in front of the MRI scanner and in this time frame received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive series, while observing either the religious-themed painting or the other.
Catholics reported that the vision of the Virgin Mary made them feel “secure,” as if “someone was taking care” of them and “they calmed down and were pervaded by peace.”
Looking at the religious-themed image, they reported 12% less pain than when they had Leonardo’s work in front of them.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who took part in the test himself, believes that such a result can be achieved with any image with a strong effect even for atheists, but you have to find the right image.
"We have to look for an image towards which they have very positive feelings, such as a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright was pleased with the result of the research.
“The practice of faith should change, and in many cases it succeeds in changing our personality,” Wright said.
After the excellent results, only the question remains whether the painting of a Madonna by Leonardo or another painter of similar caliber is presented to believers, what effect could it have on pain control?
Would the vision of a quality virgin Mary bring better results?
You are what you say about yourself
On the tenth birthday, Google can claim to be in people’s pockets as well as in the sky above their heads; it knows where they’ve spent their vacations, which clinic they attend, and what interests them.
However, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company’s directors, this is still not enough.
As for the skeptics who make a comparison with the Orwellian nightmare, they do not see the substance of web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google’s main purpose is to collect as much personal data as its users and this is necessary to stick to the original goal of Google’s founders which was: “Let’s put all the information in the world into one system!”
According to the director of Google interviewed the company, after 10 years of revolutionary work, it is still at the beginning of being able to manage all the information.
To the question what will happen in five years Schmidt answered: he would like if Google could answer questions such as "what do I do tomorrow?" or "what would be the right job for me?", but the software does not know how to answer seemingly simple questions because they do not know enough about the users.
Not all Internet users are aware that during their internet searches exactly the searched words are recorded, from which IP address they are searched and on which page the interested parties stop after the search.
Through the Personalized Search launched two years ago, for example, users can store their browsing history, they can relate to what they searched and clicked on, these will then in the long run generate much better tailored results; on this same logic is based Recommendations with which the system offers us products and services based on our preferences declared and recorded previously.
What happens if my data is used against me, if they look at what I do? – ask users concerned about Google’s data monopoly.
In most cases, the netizens’ counter-reactions are provoked by the fear felt for the size of the potential power represented by the company, and not for the sense of guilt, for the fear of punishment, for the desire for freedom or even for the rebellion to power.
However, a fact is confirmed, namely that all the expressions sought are not only recorded but in justified cases can also be provided to third parties, in such legal cases nothing defends the personal rights of Internet users.
Perhaps the most striking example of this in recent times has been the coordinated action against pedophiles in Brazil, in which Google forwarded to the Brazilian government information that made it possible to identify pedophiles from the Orkut community page maintained by Google.
Internet users concerned about personal rights sighed with relief in May when the company — in agreement with the electronic legal protection association EFF — successfully demonstrated the truth in court against the FBI: Even later, you can’t force Google with any point in the constitution to provide any information requested secretly by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government has successfully snatched almost 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search expressions obtained in reference to the confirmation of the Child Protection Act passed years earlier, but still failed to get individual users’ search lists and the entire list of web pages and keywords dating back two months.)
Google’s judgment is therefore rather contradictory: those who fear to provide their personal data scold Google because they believe that this affects their intimate sphere and private life by starting to use its services and rise up with the rebellion due to the multinationals that stand out for the conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and the proliferation of computer enthusiasts, activists and users who have appeared in numerous countries see in them the future generation of large companies, the "cool corporation", unlike their rival, Microsoft liquidated as conqueror of the world because of Windows, although both fight for the same goal.
This can happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for an identification code, does not ask for money for its services, the source code is always kept up to date and the package of programs is much more accessible, youthful and cool than the official practice of the software giant.
But it can also happen because geeks see exactly the problematic relationship between personal rights and the internet, which implies just one of the keywords repeated more often in recent years, the web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is all about collaboration, intentionally leaving traces behind us and exploiting the communication channels at our disposal and while the size of these changes for each individual, the substance is the same: to show ourselves.
An average young person can create profiles on multiple community pages, from Facebook to Xanga, he can connect them with other services such as Twitter or last.fm that lists his musical tastes, all these can be inserted in systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, he can also write blogs on which automatically appear his most recent photo galleries stored on Flickr or on Picasa.
Meanwhile, we read of numerous exemplary cases from which it is clear that the girl, seeing the series of photos taken in the morning from the common circle of friends, easily learns who spent the night with her perfidious boyfriend or a company can fire an employee because he wrote a sincere opinion on the company summit: one thing is certain, the concept of private life has now completely reconsidered.
Those who live a life online make sure to show themselves and so we can formulate the fundamental thesis that hides behind the behavior of young people.
Those who want to hide something or just want to avoid the monopoly of Google can do it (starting for example with Scroogle using the Google search system but that at the same time does not voluntarily leave traces).
There are many people who do not register on community pages to not be found, Google's online applications, from word processing to image management and newsgathering, can be replaced with alternative versions not linked to huge server parks and that do not make up our best profile so far existing.
Public opinion is not even waiting in secret for the moment when Google will pull out the claws.
Currently the company with its 156 billion dollars of value is worth more than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca Cola (110 billion dollars), the advertising spaces AdWords / AdSense threaten the revenues of advertising agencies, the services introduced in record time instead cause great discomfort not only to Microsoft but also to numerous software development companies.
However, the critical observers next to all this find alarming points: the company summit for example completely rejected the protest of the employees after doubling the rate of the company kindergarten, considered too expensive the repeated catering to the daily pleasure of the employees, all this, however, belittles the fact that in 2006 Google bowed the head of the Chinese government and under their agreement the company will filter out all the Chinese interests.
An internal rule of the company seems to be not to advertise a new service in advance but only when it will be usable, one thing is for sure, however, that the foreseeable problems of the coming months and years will move the world at one point: while some believe that the project of scanning and archiving books and magazines of Google we can create such proportions that the company will soon find itself facing the problems of the American Supreme Court Health, others are afraid.
Then the fact that Google is building a genetic database may offer good material to the next generation of science fiction writers, the story Scroogled by the famous Cory Doctorow describes the future with Orwellian accents, in which a man with Google data can be approached in an alarming way.
Two minors helped <0xC3><0x93>zd's double murderer disappear
Police questioned two minors about the double murder of <0xC3><0x93>zd, who were suspected on suspicion of helping to remove traces of the crime, a spokesman for the Borsod region police station said on Tuesday.
The young people have acknowledged the crime to their accused, currently they are accused of aiding and abetting.
The two minors, two girls according to the information of the MTI, defend themselves on their own.
Support is punishable by up to 5 years imprisonment.
The suspect in the double murder of <0xC3><0x93>zd, a 23-year-old local man, was placed in pre-trial detention on Sunday.
He is suspected of multiple premeditated murder committed for profit.
The investigation found that the 23-year-old had a large debt to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to pay off the debt, which is why last Wednesday he lured his creditor into a construction site in <0xC3><0x93>zd where he killed him and his 9-year-old daughter.
According to information from the MTI the young man had prepared to commit the crime, a sign is the fact that he committed the murder with a hidden weapon on the spot.
Police are examining the weapon and the circumstances of use with the involvement of an expert.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has made an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered 200 million euros, about 5 billion Czech crowns, for the purchase of 100% of the share price of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Poles despite the fact that the Czechs had previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange as a possible buyer of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for the exclusion is the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is state-owned.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which intends to sell more than 60% of its shares within a few months.
The Czech financial daily E15 says that the supply of Poles represents the highest figure so far advanced for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Transatlantic Stock Exchange Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the German Stock Exchange have so far submitted an offer.
Petr Koblic, director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that of all the interested parties the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst owner and did not rule out that this could lead in the future to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at 5-10 billion crowns.
According to the shareholders' agreement, almost 90% of the shares would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance with a share of almost 25%, followed by Banca <0xC4><0x8C>eská Spo<0xC5><0x99>itelna with 14.7% and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5%.
The economic crisis from the point of view of European newspapers
The main European newspapers in their comments on Tuesday dedicated to the international economic crisis already speak of "a second 9/11".
The global financial disaster has occurred thanks to the American president - accuses La Repubblica - who has not been able to compact his party behind a hastily drunken law, whose purpose is to remedy a desperate situation.
Instead of a second Pearl Harbor, as billionaire super-financier Warren Buffett put it, it would be more accurate to speak of a second 9/11.
Even a part of the Madrid press sees Washington as the scapegoat.
According to El Mundo, the lack of American political leadership has pushed the world economy to the brink.
The danger of the collapse of the American financial system is growing, and the whole world will suffer as a result.
Bush’s plan was not perfect but as a result of the congressional vote there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political means for managing the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air, just as the greatest transformation in the history of capitalism is taking place.
It is no longer possible to ignore the threat - mentions the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva.
Some states today can still offer a lifeline to teetering financial institutions, and with taxpayer money they can save them from bankruptcy.
But if more and more banks collapse as in a domino effect then neither the financial means nor new improvised solutions will be enough.
In the long term it is necessary for EU member states to overcome their national egoism and concentrate control on dismembered financial markets.
Weakened financial institutions received more than 100 billion euros on Monday alone, according to the Vienna-based Der Standard, according to which the anxieties that European taxpayers, similar to those of the United States, will have to put their hands to their wallets to remedy the crisis seem increasingly real.
The EU has so far not cared much about the crisis that has swept across the old continent like a tsunami.
The "saviors" do not have to wave at once the 100 billion euros, however it would be better if they determined in which case it is appropriate to touch the taxpayers' money to prevent greater damage.
Intelligent machine mimics the flight of the hornet
What could be the best method to develop collision avoidance technologies if not mimicking the obstacle sensors found in nature?
For example, the bees.
In the stunning project presented at CEATEC in Japan, the hornets provided the initial strategic cue to Nissan engineers on how to build the next generation of collision avoidance systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the BR23C biomimetic robot, a robotic minicar with the properties of bees, with the ultimate goal of creating a system capable of avoiding all collisions.
Flying bees form their own personal oval space that really looks a lot like our protective shield - explained Kazuhiro Doi, director of PR technologies and research and development at the exhibition.
Important is the role of the view of the bee, capable of a view of 300 degrees in each direction.
The engineers drew on the telemetric laser idea to copy the function of the bee's view.
The BR23C detects obstacles up to two meters away within a 180-degree radius, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor that immediately turns it into a command to avoid collision.
In a fraction of a second the robot perceives the obstacle and then, imitating the movements of the bee, immediately changes direction by turning the wheels of the necessary measure to avoid the accident.
This avoidance maneuver, unlike the current system, takes place in a completely instinctive way.
"If this were not the case, the robot car would not be able to react quickly to avoid collisions," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robot car project.
It must react instinctively and immediately because this technology corresponds to the damaging and innermost layer of the protective shield, within which collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process has to mirror what a bee does to avoid the other bees.
This process must take place in the blink of an eye.
But unlike bees the deviation can not go up or down or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional and in the steering direction of the wheels.
In this way, instead of the infinite possibilities available to bees to avoid other bees, the robot, as a possibility available, can rotate on itself, accelerate and slow down.
The BR23C is powered by lighter, high-energy density lithium polymer batteries, which means they last longer than lithium-ion batteries.
According to Andoh, it is the instantaneousness of the intelligent reaction that is important, not the processing of the data or even less the ability to store it.
This robot has to process some inputs in a few seconds and react.
There is no need to store them and react with intuitive logic based on the previous maneuver data, so it only uses a memory of a few tens of Kb.
There is no need for a memory of gigabytes or megabytes.
This is the first step towards the development of a technology for the immediate avoidance of collisions that, according to Nissan, can be installed on production vehicles within 10 years.
Further possibility of application can be represented by the unification with the GPS satellite navigation system that avoiding the obstacles present on the road leads to the destination.

The written version of the $700 billion economic bailout law has been drawn up for the purchase of disproportionate credits, to be applied in several parts.
In the first step, half of the amount is spent.
In the new agreements that were extended until midnight on Saturday according to East Coast time, congressional leaders decided on the $700 billion bailout plan after a debate that had been going on for days.
We've made some serious progress," said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, who said the only thing left to do is put the deal on paper.
Both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain, supported the compromise plan.
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, speaking on the outcome of the compromise, said: "The program will work and it will be effective, but there is still a lot to be done. According to Pelosi it is not about saving Wall Street but about reversing the economic wagon.
The written version of the plan was made public before Asian markets opened at 8 a.m. according to Washington time (2 p.m. on Monday according to Central European time), but it did not bring much stock market growth.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will vote first on a bill called the 2008 Economic Stabilization Act on the program, after which it will be up to the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on Saturday night, then welcomed the news of the deal to the White House.
“We are pleased with the progress made tonight and highly appreciate the two parties’ efforts to stabilize our financial markets and defend the economy,” White House spokesman Tony Fratto said in a statement.
The program, however, differs from the Bush administration’s original proposal that $700 billion would all be spent on buying the bonds with disproportionate credits behind them.
Now as a first step you can spend at most half of the sum of 700 billion dollars, 250 billion immediately after the vote of Monday in Congress, with these the Treasury will buy securities with disproportionate credits behind, the fate of the remaining 100 billion dollars will decide the president.
A special college will oversee the program, which also includes the chairman of the Federal Reserve.
The spending of the other half of the $700 billion depends on a new congressional decree.
Under the law, the Treasury can apply a combined tactic: it can simultaneously buy loans, mortgages and securities with mortgages and other types of "poisoned" loans.
The purchase can take place through auctions and in a direct way - announced competents of the ministry.
The legal rule makes it possible for the companies concerned to take part in an insurance program where the Ministry of the Treasury guarantees the means that give concern, for which the companies will pay an appropriate price for the probable damages.
Henrz Paulson said: The law gives the necessary means for $700 billion to arrive for the urgent needs of the American monetary system, whether it is the purchase of the wrong financial means, or their insurance or to avoid the risk of the collapse of a large financial institution.
We will take all the necessary steps to be ready to introduce the law just signed - he added.
The directors of the banks in crisis and waiting for state aid think instead that the government will limit their recovery, defined by the overseas slang simply as golden parachutes.
Limitations on payments will only occur in some cases, and the limitations depend on how the Treasury Department will offer the aid.
In essence, the limitation means that if the ministry buys under an auction, it will impose a surcharge on the golden parachute, if they do not retire the fallen bank manager.
At the time of the direct purchase of the disproportionate credits, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the directors’ money is not exaggerated.
To this must be added that the existing contracts of the golden parachute will not change, the limitation is valid only for new ones to incentivize participation in the program.
This is the first time in American history that a statutory limit on CEO pay has come into effect, said Democratic House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank.
In addition, the state has the right to appropriate a share of the banks participating in the program, decreasing the risk of the taxpayers, since in the end they can also gain from it if the economy, and together with it the rescued bank, will get back on its feet.
The bill includes a five-year requirement for the president to submit to Congress a proposal that provides for the return of expected losses from the financial sector to taxpayers.
Of course, there were those on both sides who expressed their doubts about the project.
“This is not what American citizens have asked us not to defend taxpayer dollars,” said Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif.
His fellow Ohio Democrat Mary Kaptur believes that the measures were taken by the very ones who are responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industry prices continue to rise
The prices of domestic industrial sales in August 2008 increased by 0.1% compared to the previous month, by 12.9% compared to August 2007 - informs the Hungarian Central Institute of Statistics.
The prices of export sales of the industry reported in July 2008 were higher by 1.1%, compared to the previous year they decreased by 3.9%
As a result of the change in domestic and export prices, industrial production costs were 0.7% higher than the previous month and 3.2% higher than a year ago.
The prices of domestic industrial sales compared to the previous month increased by only 0.1%.
The prices of domestic sales of the processing sector also rose to a minimum, 0.1%, compared to July.
The largest increase in prices in August 2008 occurred in the leather and shoe processing sector (2.8%), especially bags and belts with 4.6% and shoe production with 2.5% monthly increase.
The high price level of plastic and chemical raw materials caused a significant monthly increase (1.6%) in the chemicals and products sector.
A decrease in prices occurred in the oil processing sector (1.4%), in the production of electrical tools and machinery (0.9%) and to a minimum extent in wood processing (0.1%).
The prices of paper production, publishing and printing activities have not changed.
In the other sectors of the processing industry there was an increase in prices of between 0.2 and 0.9%.
In the field of electricity, gas, steam and water supply prices increased in August by 0.3% in domestic industrial sales, primarily as a result of the dominant effect of the increase in the price of gas carried out by the authorities since 1 July.
Compared to 12 months, considering the domestic sales of the sectors of the processing industry, the largest increases were in the processing of petroleum products (32.4%).
In the manufacture of products derived from metal processing, the price increase was 13.2%, 11% in the production of food, beverages and tobacco representing a decisive weight.
There was a decrease in prices in the textile sector (2.5%) and in the production of electrical tools and machinery (0.3%).
In the other sectors of the processing industry, the rate of price increase varied from 0.6% to 9.1%.
In total in the processing industry in the past year prices rose by 10.2%.
Prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sector were 18.7% higher than last year.
In domestic sales among the target groups of sectors, the largest monthly price increase occurred in August in sectors producing capital goods (0.7%).
In the sectors that produce consumer goods prices grew by 0.3%, in the energy and subsequent use sector prices did not change from those of the previous month.
In August 2008, compared to the same month last year, the increase in larger prices was observed in the energy and subsequent use sector (16.8%).
In the sectors producing consumer goods the increase was 6.8%, for investment goods a decrease of 1.4% was measured.
The prices of industrial export sales calculated in florins grew in August by 1.1% compared to the previous month, compared to a decrease of 3.9% in 12 months.
The Hungarian forint weakened against the euro by 1.7% in the space of a month, against the dollar by 7.1%, compared to August 2007 it strengthened by 7.5% against the euro and by 15.9% against the dollar.
Next year in the U.S. without a visa?
Kinga G<0xC3><0xB6>ncz sees the possibility that around January 12 the American-Hungarian visa waiver agreement could enter into force - the Foreign Minister spoke about this in Chicago with the Hungarian representatives of the place.
In his opinion "it all depends on the fact that overseas the electronic system of entry and control is built in time".
However, it has drawn attention to the fact that in the new system there will no longer be an entry permit, however before departure tourists will have to register.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy will continue negotiations in Washington from today.
He will meet with Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, to whom he will award the Cross of the Order of the Hungarian Republic with the Star and will hold talks with the foreign policy advisers of Democratic candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and John McCain also backed the bank bailout.
Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of the two big American parties, on Sunday guaranteed their support for the government’s $700 billion plan to rescue the banks, but there are politicians who demand the resignation of the Treasury minister.
Representatives of Congress and the administration after marathon negotiations lasted for days, Sunday night announced that they had concluded an agreement in principle on the plan to rescue the banks.
The Wall Street crisis and the financial package for the release of the frozen credit market have become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain want to be better suited than their rival to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls with the spotlight on economic issues Obama has again regained some advantage, while the advantage of McCain, obtained after the Republican convention with the appointment of vice president Sarah Palin, has disappeared.
Obama in a speech in Detroit expressed hope that Congress would quickly pass the law on the $700 billion plan.
He pointed out that the proposal contains those consumer protection steps which were also supported by him.
"Now we have to act responsibly ... the danger threatens your work, your savings, all industrial sectors, complete economic stability," he said in front of a crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not shy away from calling McCain’s economic ideas outdated.
In an interview with ABC News, McCain said, “We’re all going to have a hard time dealing with this situation ... but doing nothing is not a viable path.”
The Republican senator reported that the proposal includes the creation of a control committee of the Minister of Finance and the limitation of the good exits of top managers, things on which he was to insist.
Obama told CBS that McCain did not have a meritorious role in the deals, but he was in daily contact with the minister.
President Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that the House of Representatives will likely vote on the bill as early as Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking world
The right pole is intact, only inside the pole have voters become more self-aware - thus Der Spiegel analyzes the weak outcome of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider's party is ready to rule Austria to prevent the red-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
Franz Walter, in the internet edition of the left-wing German magazine, in the article The Bavarian Revolution devours its parents analyzes the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber couple took office.
The Christian-socialists have been modernizing Bavaria for decades and right now these modern citizens are moving away from them.
The change of era is at the same time a problem of the whole of Christian democracy, as well as of Angela Merker.
The defeat was not a big surprise for the CSU, but on Sunday it ended a process that exactly ten years ago had been feasible: it ended the indisputable hegemony of a party-state.
Already 10 years ago, in 1998, the CSU had plummeted to 47.7%, for the first time below the 50% threshold since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago at the Bundestag elections in 2005, still in the period of the much-mentioned Stoiber.
The cause of this is the consequent modernization in the region, which devours the parents.
Sociologists predicted this 40 years ago, but they were wrong a long time ago. But secularization, the results of education, the settlement of East and North Germans in the developed Bavarian region could not remain without consequences on the loyalty of voters to the CSU.
Modernisation goes hand in hand with increased possibilities and the political consequences are clear.
The pole on the right is intact, only within the pole have voters become more self-aware, critical, obstinate.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks the classic bourgeois groups have moved away from the CSU: freelancers, artisans, graduates and graduates.
Support for CSU here has fallen below 40%.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The conservative Viennese newspaper "Who with whom?" In the article "Party presidents are stuck in coalition issues" deals with the confusing internal Austrian political situation created as a result of the elections.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> intends to deal with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP shall prohibit SP<0xC3><0x96> from interfering in its internal affairs.
The BZ<0xC3><0x96> is open to negotiations in all directions, the Greens still do not want to discuss coalition.
The elections have been held, now it all revolves around the coalition; in the discussion broadcast on public television the leaders of the parties have just shown the cards.
Werner Faymann, president of the SP<0xC3><0x96>, has confirmed that he wants to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to show that collaboration between the two parties is possible, in some regions and in the social partnership already exists.
Faymann left open the question of whether he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the <0xC3><0x96>VP, as vice-chancellor.
As he said, the Sch<0xC3><0xBC>ssel-Molterer course was in any case rejected.
The repetition of this direction is not considered.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the red offers.
As he said, the collaboration will certainly not succeed if Faymann tries to meddle in <0xC3><0x96>VP’s internal affairs.
Whether his party chooses the opposition or enters the coalition is still an open thing in the party, the issues must be discussed in any case within the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
J<0xC3><0xB6>rg Haider leader of the BZ<0xC3><0x96> repeated that he is open in all directions.
"To prevent the red-black coalition, we are ready to assume the responsibility of governing," Haider said.
Jár<0xC3><0xB3>ka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today in Paris, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities began, organized this year by France with the rotating presidency of the European Union.
L<0xC3><0xAD>via Jár<0xC3><0xB3>ka, Fidesz deputy of the European People's Party in the message addressed to the plenum as the main rapporteur of the congress drew attention to school segregation because it is the most serious legal violation that affects Roma children and also the most serious obstacle for their affirmation.
Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, on behalf of the French Presidency, and the European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r <0xC5><0xA0>pidla, opened the conference at the highest level.
Among those invited to the conference were governments, European social partners and representatives of major European civil and equal opportunity rights organisations.
Jár<0xC3><0xB3>ka, according to the press office of the parliamentary group Fidesz PE, recalled, in addition to discrimination in hiring, that Roma are expelled from the labor market primarily because of their low education.
"The majority of young Roma do not have a medium-level education qualification and as a result of poor quality elementary education only a negligible number of them can achieve a higher education qualification."
Jár<0xC3><0xB3>ka also stressed, as a fundamental human right, the key role of education in upholding human rights.
Investing in the education of Roma children can strengthen the economy of EU member states.
According to the MEP it is necessary to make these links aware in the wider context between Roma and non-Roma.
In fact, the sooner a Roma starts school, the greater his chances of becoming a productive member of the labor market; through taxes paid for income and consumption they contribute to the nation’s budget.
"The right of Roma to European citizenship must guarantee their right to quality education and the elimination of low-level and segregated schools" - stressed L<0xC3><0xAD>via Jár<0xC3><0xB3>ka.
According to the MEP, the union of purpose and action of the European Union is necessary to speed up the processes of desegregation of schools and for this reason it is of fundamental importance the correct respect of the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives.
"The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be broken, Roma children must be given the opportunities granted by the democratic space so that they can contribute as full citizens to the future of Europe" - asked Jár<0xC3><0xB3>ka.
In the sign of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities" to be guaranteed for all, the aim of the European Summit for Equal Opportunities organized every year by the meeting in Berlin last year is to ensure a single forum to promote the objectives of anti-discrimination and equal opportunities set at state and European level.
CSU: Mercy for a Transitional Period
At the end of October, the fate of the awkward Huber-Beckstein couple will be decided.
Despite the ugly electoral defeat the heads have not yet fallen, at the top of the Bavarian CSU the discussion of personal issues has been postponed for the time being.
Party chairman Erwin Huber and regional governor G<0xC3><0xBC>nther Beckstein still remain in place, the question is as long as pity lasts.
On the fate of the tandem that suffered a catastrophic loss of votes of 17% will decide the extraordinary congress of the party in the last weekend of October.
The two highly criticized politicians have made it known in any case that they are not being attacked with all their might in the chair.
They tried so hard to soften the angry members of the parliamentary group and the rank and file that a day after the "Bavarian tsunami" they claimed the personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber at the height of his career, the Christian Social Union achieved 60.7%, now instead after the coup against Stoiber they have fallen to 43.4%.
The CSU for 46 years has been "absolute monarch" in Bavaria which gives 18% of German GDP.
The conservatives in the southern region, which is crucial to Hungary's economy, always count, however, and in the future they will be forced to coalesce anyway.
As a first sign of the reorganization within the party, Vice President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, considered possible heir to Huber, obtains a place in the small exploratory group that will begin negotiations with the liberals of the FDP and with the Free Voters exponents of right-wing values for a possible government coalition in Munich.
For a strange joke of destiny in the list of Free Voters enters the legislature that Gabriele Pauli whose attitude against Stoiber had been exploited as an opportunity for coup by the Huber-Beckstein couple and then treat the woman without regard for great ambitions.
CSU leaders are now concentrating all their forces to somehow stabilize Beckstein.
The former regional governor and former CSU president has called September 28 the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made some statements to the CSU, according to which they deserved more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
Merkel will not be chancellor after the September 2009 Bundestag elections unless the CSU, which played a decisive role in the 2005 national victory, is reinstated with joint forces.
According to Merkel, who does not hide the disappointment for the fiasco, the loss of land of the CSU will not have a negative impact on the grand coalition of Berlin.
What is certainly relative: it will not be easy to manage the wounded CSU, the crisis of the social democrats instead still lasts.
The SPD achieved its lowest result since 1946 in Bavaria with 18.6%.
Lukashenko-opposition: 110-0
Not even a representative of the opposition entered the Belarusian Parliament after Sunday's elections.
According to Russian observers it is the sign of well-being and stability assured in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) instead it is explained by the frauds committed in the vote count.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the elections.
Although the legislation of 110 people from a country of 10 million people has been unopposed for more than a decade, prior to yesterday's elections the opposition gathered under the name United Democratic Forces (ODS) seriously hoped that Lukashenko, with the presidential mandate renewed for the fourth time following the constitutional amendment to the 2006 elections held under discussed circumstances, would "conceed to
The ODS has thus renounced a boycott previously evaluated.
Behind the expectations of the opposition was that Belarus, increasingly economically dependent on Russia, which has asked for a credit to reduce the import of increasingly expensive Russian natural gas and has agreed to give the Russians the pipelines in possession of Beltransgaz that cross the country, intended to improve the relationship with the EU where Lukashenko and other high-ranking bidemocrat politicians can not enter for the political situation.
He referred to a detente that the OSCE, in assessing the election campaign, placed emphasis on positive movements and not on shortcomings, such as the ban on one-third of opposition candidates running.
But Monday's quick OSCE report also criticized the campaign, during which opposition candidates could not appear in the press, and in particular that the opposition could not be present at the vote count.
Despite this, according to the opposition, there is an improvement in the political climate: political prisoners have been released, Minsk is also willing to a small confrontation with Moscow while continuing to deny the recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia by Georgia, even if Russia, with which Belarus forms on paper a federal state, considers the two countries to be independent for a month already.
We have taken two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun - Alexander Milinkevich told our newspaper.
According to the presidential candidate of the opposition of the elections of 2006 it is desirable that it remains despite the fact that "the power has been afraid to let even one opponent into a parliament without weight".
The opposition does not foresee protest actions for the results but rather tries to get the message to the voters about the need for economic reforms.
Obviously we have many problems, we have to print opposition newspapers in Russia, for distribution the local authorities raise difficulties, but even so I see that more and more people support the change, even among the elderly - said Milinkevich referring to the fact that not even the most officially helped class, that of pensioners, considers adequate the regime of Lukashenko who considers its main result the creation of security.
Due to the country's indebtedness and increasing economic deficit it is only a matter of time before the disintegration of social security "reminiscent of the sepulchral silence" - believes Milinkevich.
Contrary to the opposition politician, Russian observers considered the elections democratic.
President of the Commonwealth of Independent States Sergei Lebedev told the Russian news agency RIA Novosti: "men believe not in words but in deeds", so the lack of opposition is nothing more than proof of maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunette: "From now on breakfast before work"
It has never happened in the history of Palazzo Chigi that there were revolving doors for the entrance and exit of employees.
But from today this new measure against the smart ones, against those who stamp and then go to drink a coffee at the bar during working hours.
The new antifannulloni was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"The revolving doors - says Brunetta - are a tool to work better, with more productivity, more attendance and more services", specifies the minister.
“A new season of accountability and transparency is opening up.
This is reformism,” says Brunetta.
With Palazzo Chigi the installation in all the palaces of the Presidency of the Council is completed.
For Masi "the choice of revolving doors is also important from a symbolic point of view".
There was no resistance from the employees, the secretary general assures: "It was a process shared by the workers and there was the collaboration of all."
In short, no more breakfast at work; no more coffee and croissant.
Brunette’s word, which suggests, smiling, “a nice cappuccino at 7 in the morning is a holy hand.”
During a conference at the Scuola Superiore della Pubblica
In Rome, the minister then notes that "in three months the sick leave of public employees has been reduced by 50%, that is to say 60,000 more people at work in a year".
He added that public administration needs to be made more efficient.
In Italy, “wage dynamics over the last 8-10 years have been double that of the private sector and well above inflation rates.”
Meanwhile, thousands of civil servants have joined together to challenge the rules of the Brunetta decree by adhering to the appeal supported by the Codacons.
"While the minister of the Public Function today flaunts numbers about the less absenteeism at work due to causes of illness - writes the association of consumers - the people of the 'worker nulls' is constantly growing.
In fact, thousands of correct and productive public administration employees in Italy have joined forces to declare war on the illegitimate norms contained in the decree.
In particular, the Tar will contest the exclusion of additional economic treatments for illness dependent on the cause of service; the extension of the time slots of availability of the sick worker, within which the control visits are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions desired by the minister.
Accidents at work, Napolitano: "Crucial prevention"
Every day, in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur at work, 3 people die and 27 remain permanently disabled.
For 2007, Inail data confirm that white deaths were about 1,200.
Figures that testify to the seriousness of a phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
To draw the attention of institutions, social forces and the media to this dramatic issue, today Anmil celebrates in all the provinces of Italy the 58th National Day for Victims of Accidents at Work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data disseminated by Anmil and the same tragic chronicles of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is," says the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the president of Anmil, the National Association of disabled and disabled workers, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expresses his "living appreciation for the constant commitment of the association in favor of prevention in the workplace, the protection of injured workers, the assistance of the families of the victims and the awareness of public opinion".
"Of course, there has been an indignant 'enough', sincerely shared, in the face of tragedies that, due to their size, arouse the clamor of the media and the involvement of public opinion, but the daily reality presents us with dramatic cases, even repetitive in their dynamics.
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly also a problem of resources: it is decisive to invest in training and information.
Particular significance is given to the numerous initiatives promoted in the school environment for a more direct awareness by young people entering the world of work.
It is necessary to keep alive the attention to the phenomenon, not to linger in alarm on its social gravity, to apply and to improve the legislative norms.
For his part, the President of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini stressed "how the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each of us and imposes on all institutions a decisive commitment to put an end to it urgently".
"The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but that does not mean that the number of white deaths is still impressive," remarked the president of Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
In fact, we would not want this “downtrend” to translate into less attention, because it is precisely when attention is relaxed that the tragedy explodes.
"We believe that at a general level too little is still being done to combat the phenomenon of injuries and the contrast can be exercised through multiple actions.
They are necessary, in our opinion - it has emphasized Mercandelli - greater controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the formation of the workers, and this starting from the world of the school".
"Further effort is needed - it has added - regarding the communication and the sensitization of the public opinion.
But above all, we need a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards a phenomenon that represents a social emergency.
Mercandelli then denounced "the progressive deterioration of the levels of indemnity protection provided for victims of work" and the "assistance drift towards which the system is moving in recent years".
"The aim is therefore to return the insurance guarantee to the worker - he added - so that the fate of those who are injured should not depend on spontaneity or generosity from time to time ordered by the legislator."
MP3 players indicted, put hearing at risk
Listening to loud music for an extended period of time using portable music devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing injury.
The European Commission, in a statement issued in Brussels, cited the opinion of the EU Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (CSRSERI), published today.
“From this scientific opinion, it emerges that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable musical devices weekly for more than an hour a day while holding the device at high volume risk a permanent loss of hearing ability.”
“I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and mobile phones at high acoustic levels may unconsciously damage their hearing irreparably,” says Meglena Kuneva.
“From the scientific findings, a clear risk emerges and we need to react quickly.
Most importantly, we need to raise consumer awareness and make this information public.
We also need to re-examine existing control systems, in the light of this scientific opinion, to ensure that they are fully effective and keep up with new technology."
Brussels had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the large use of portable musical instruments and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise caused by them.
“Scientists confirm that there is cause for concern and the European Commission will now examine with Member States and stakeholders what measures could be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable music players and related equipment.”
Currently, there is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable music equipment to 100 dB, but concerns about hearing damage that can result from excessive exposure to such noise sources are growing.
These damages can be greatly reduced by using solutions such as reducing the levels and duration of exposure to noise.
In its opinion, the EU Scientific Committee points out that users of portable musical equipment if they listen to music at a high volume (more than 89 decibels) for only 5 hours a week exceed the limits currently in force relating to the maximum noise allowed in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods risk a permanent loss of hearing ability after a period of 5 years.
This would affect 5-10% of users of such devices and their number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Germany kicks off the Commission for the future of the capital
Today it begins, in March it closes, in June the sums will be drawn.
This is the schedule set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the future of Rome Capitale", which settled this morning in its new headquarters behind the Baths of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will develop the guidelines for Rome.
Once closed in March, the Junta and the City Council will evaluate analyzes and projects, so that in June they can present the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and its mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural ideas are represented - Alemanno underlines - It will have to provide proposals for an idea of development of Rome of which the political decision-makers, who remain the Junta and the City Council, will then be able to make use.
There is no overlap of roles but only the desire to have a place to elaborate a great project for Rome.
In March it will finish its work and then it will dissolve, because this experience must have a precise temporal term.
In June - the mayor announces - we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of Roma Capitale".
To those who accuse the Commission of being useless, since its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replies: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and on the quality of its proposals.
If the quality will be there, as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am sure also in Rome, its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics is crushed on the management of the daily life and on the emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to look longer and further, in a deeper perspective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future.
In addition, the mayor of Rome wishes to point out that "this Commission is neither a useless entity nor a carriage: it is absolutely free, it will not cost a euro to Roman citizens and will serve to reason and involve the best intelligences expressed by the Capital".
For Alemanno, in fact, "it is necessary to have a strategic reference design, not closed or immobile, to allow our city to make an authentic level jump, which it absolutely needs, thinking with a united spirit to its future".
A future that, says the mayor of Rome, "will not be limited to the current municipal borders but will look far beyond" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as Capital but "also in consideration of the role that Rome can and must play as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? The first anti-American president. That's why
He wrote a well-known American politician who likes us to pass for independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions decimated the US economy and had relations (as he does today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam.
Attacks on Obama are on the rise just as the election date approaches.
A Miami woman wrote on a website: “This person is full of ambition.
Obama has a big, tough face: he believes he will win the highest office in a nation that has had two governors and five black senators in all!
In reality they are attacks that do not say much; they are clearly attacks of a racial nature and do not answer the question of the voters: will he be a good president? Then there are the polls; they all say that Obama will win and with a good detachment.
Also in this case there are those who speak with the heart but not with the brain.
A newspaper in Mississippi, in the bowels of the southern United States, wrote an editorial: once in the booth to vote we know well to whom the American patriot will give his vote.
It comes out one side of the American mentality kept covered to the last.
“Say what you want, then we’ll figure out where to put the cross, whether it’s Obama or McCain.”
There are people who swear that if Obama wins, we will leave America.
Things never said before, which seems almost certain the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all these arguments, the winning weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
They asked 1500 people: what were the mistakes made by Bush during his term? 89 percent answered: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was kicked in the ass.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack their bags.
Yet, Iraq for the most part was Bush’s weak spot.
Whoever takes George W’s place will have a huge task ahead of them.
In the US, the economic collapse is also felt by journalists: in the newspapers it is time for cuts. And many blame the internet, "murderer" of the printed paper.
Five hundred American journalists were asked by the PEW Research Center about the state of their profession and mind control regarding the future.
Well, today journalists are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, the news did not openly state that they felt any less concerned about credibility.
They don’t feel as isolated as they once did.
The problem for U.S. journalists is money, the money.
The crisis of 2008 for these journalists is a crisis of a destroyed economic model.
In addition, the cuts made in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work to put together the newspapers, is a big problem.
It is a problem that must be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism as the general public understands it is not to be substantially reduced.
A clear but complex pessimism pervades the American journalist today.
Six out of ten newspapermen and senior executives are convinced that the newspaper at the national level is following a wrong path.
In the local field the executive group is 65%.
Printed versus broadcast.
It’s not hard for journalists to see where the web is going.
The major publishing houses are opening a door to the internet, for many seen as the "murderer" of printed paper.
The “economic pressure” that journalists feel has increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope that it will “do something good” for their journalism.
The biggest gap in American journalism today is between those who run the newsrooms — that is, the editors — and the reporters who work for them.
56% of executives at the national level are sure that their reporters share their values, while at the local level the percentage drops to 23%.
For some this has to do with “job security”.
Executives who think they will lose their jobs within 3 years are at 47% nationwide.
For the staff reporters it goes to 30%.
“Safe work” at the staff level in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work on a contract.
In a huge nation like the United States, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and internet, employers often offer what they want and it becomes a matter of "take it or leave it", take it or leave it.
Directors almost always receive large salaries, while the editor can earn as much as $10,000 a month, in addition to pension and insurance payments.
For the holidays, then, the reasoning becomes complicated: tot days after the first year, tot after the third to get to 15 days in total after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, by their own admission, often “get sick” during the year.
It's all about the climate.
UNIPOL: ROME COURT, DANILO COPPOLA REST AT GROTTAFERRATA
The president of the second criminal section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the request of the real estate developer Danilo Coppola who had asked to be able to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a house in the city of Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy in the context of the investigation into the counter-measure relating to the Unipol-Bnl climb.
During the trial against him, last week, he obtained the release from the domiciliaries transformed into an obligation of residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate developer could travel from the provincial town to a house in the capital.
According to the court, however, these moves (to which the PM gave the opposite opinion) would allow him to influence his company and access the evidence that accuses him.
Elites in Danger
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a few days ago with the vote of the House of Representatives against the $ 700 billion rescue plan launched by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and is, more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy.
The New York Times yesterday gives us a confirmation of this by informing us that the ongoing crisis is splitting the Republican Party, increasingly divided between its old East Coast soul, moderate, favorable to federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, instead, conservative, hostile to "those of Washington" and the world of finance, strong especially in the States of the Center and South.
The soul, in fact, which has become powerfully alive with the vow of which I said at the beginning.
But this is only one example of the changes, of the great changes, which the current economic earthquake perhaps foreshadows or already reveals: not only in the United States but throughout the West and perhaps not even here alone.
Both in the United States and in Europe, the crisis seems to work as an accelerator of long-incubating phenomena that in the new climate solidify and finally come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the reactualization, the extraordinary relaunch, of the dual category State-sovereignty in relation to a sort of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking and financial institutions which, yes, have close links with foreign countries, but which, first of all, see the balance sheets of people and families living in a single country, in a single state, involved to a very large extent.
This immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and families who, among other things, are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears economically global but politically it is almost exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems essentially out of the question or does not have much to say: the clear evidence is given by the European Union which, as usual, is divided between the different interests and between the different state strategies and fails to decide on any common political line.
And so it is from the government of every single state that everyone expects interventions, rescue and recovery plans, new rules, and above all the disbursement of funds: since when it comes to the straits it is only the states that possess the economic resources, the mass of financial resources can try to put things right.
And they also possess the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of immeasurable value, in certain circumstances, of which probably no market and no international organization will ever be able to dispose to a similar extent.
This new emphasis that the crisis places on the state-national element is, moreover, in perfect harmony with the increasing importance that the most recent developments in the economy tend to attribute to a factor very closely linked to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we had now entered the realm of the network, of increasingly sophisticated technology, of the immaterial, while we were convinced that globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we suddenly realized that our future will instead have to deal increasingly with those things that are very little immaterial that are water, crops, oil.
All things that, look a little, can certainly be transported from one place to another of the earth but are still linked in an absolute way to a circumscribed space, to a territory.
So those who are sovereign, certainly have several more cards than those who are not, those who have the misfortune to live in a place without crops, without oil and without water.
I come to the second novelty, however, which foreshadows a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective need for authoritative leadership, the demand for someone who knows how to take matters into their own hands.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for the existing leaderships, economic species, which have proved so inadequate and full of shadow zones.
And at the same time something even deeper and in a certain sense disturbing: a discredit, an insufferance, an image of inadequacy, a sense of distance, which tends to involve the entire ruling class in an increasing number of Western countries.
In other words, it seems to be making more and more way, in large sectors of the population, the conviction that before their actions are the same ideas of the social elites so far in vogue, their way of feeling and being, their culture in the overall meaning of the term, to have done their time and to be increasingly alien to the opinions of the majorities.
The demand for leadership, in short, feeds underground a ramified but powerful movement of delegitimization of the ruling classes and traditional political structures, which is manifested in the sudden electoral "revolts" or in the sudden turns of the collective moods of these last and very recent times.
One gets the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their formats would say, are increasingly struggling to understand, and therefore to represent, what is not taking shape today in the deep layers of Western societies and that the economic crisis reinvigorates, increases, potentially agitates.
In the face of all this, to speak of a “rebellion of the masses” on the agenda would be frankly an exaggeration.
Keeping your eyes open is certainly not.
The super glue to walk on the walls
Defeat the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in the future walk on the walls like Spiderman.
It is the goal of several American research centers and now a team of four institutes has gone very close to it.
With a sticker of only 2.5 square centimeters, the researchers were able to glue a body of 100 kilograms on a vertical wall.
The American journal Science has published the findings of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team is an evolution of existing ones that use a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
“The glue principle can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged like a stack of spaghetti,” explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists were inspired by the legs of geckos, covered with microscopic hairs that are able to ensure a perfect adhesion to the animal.
Tests conducted on different materials, such as glass, Teflon and sandpaper, showed that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles and at the same time "easily detaches from the wall," explains Liming Dai, a researcher in the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
WALK ON THE WALLS? -"This material could be useful as a temporary adhesive" adds Liming Dai.
Maybe to walk on the walls just like Spiderman? Maybe so, but the researchers think of a much less fascinating use as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electricity.
Other applications could relate to aerospace engineering.
There are no superheroes at the moment.
ALTRA RESEARCH – The University of California, Berkeley, is also devoting itself to the search for a new adhesive.
In an article in the journal of the American Chemical Society, Californian scholars presented an adhesive formed by microfibers such as hair that self-cleans from dust during movement on a surface to always maintain a perfect adhesion.
Medications: never with fruit juices
Watch out for grapefruit juice, orange juice and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed especially in summer because they are thirst quenching and rich in vitamins, if taken at the same time as some life-saving drugs alter their absorption by amplifying or decreasing their effectiveness depending on the case with serious consequences for health.
To reiterate the risks of fruit juices both packaged and fresh associated with the intake of some medicines David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, who from the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia launches a new alarm: just a glass of grapefruit juice, orange and apple benefits to reduce the absorption of some drugs.
Grapefruit juice had already been accused of being responsible for increasing the effects of some antiarrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, antihistamine and neurological drugs to levels considered toxic.
The same Italian Agency of the drug had announced it in a bulletin two years ago alerting doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger arising from this mix and to be careful about what you drink in case you take drugs such as Diazepam or Methadone.
According to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit drugs.
Along the list of active ingredients inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
Michele Carruba, director of the department of pharmacology at the State University of Milan, said: “These findings are generally reported to the various international and national drug agencies who may change the information notes of the drugs.
So always read the package leaflets of the medicines you take and if there is something that is not clear, do not impress us but ask the doctor or pharmacist for clarification, "said the expert to the agency Ansa.
The Nobel Prize in Economics to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to Paul Krugman for his studies of business models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a New Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known New York Times columnist.
Krugman is a leading critic of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy choices.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, in the days when Enron was failing, Krugman had predicted in an editorial published in the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States.
A forecast that sparked quite a few controversies and that for years was insulted to the economist, but that has now turned out to be accurate.
“I’m surprised and also a little shocked by the speed with which the memory of scandals like the collapse of Enron or Worldcom has disappeared from the public’s attention,” Krugman said in late 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "economist of great value", but also a disseminator with a "very aggressive style, particularly critical against the excesses of liberalism of the Bush administration".
Open Office, here is the third edition of the package"anti-Microsoft<0xC2><0xBB>
OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source suite of personal productivity that aims to reach more and more users, from the home to the office, from professionals to the public administration, as a free alternative to the best known Microsoft Office.
After almost a year of work by volunteer developers, behind whose back watches SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the general public with several news: to the welcome screen and the revised interface and made less spartan, are added other more substantial such as the native compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new format ODF (Open Document Standard) 1.2, the '
Attention also paid to the interoperability with the Office 2007 suite, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific features of some modules such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example to send them by email, or the ability to import PDF files into the graphic processing module, while maintaining the original appearance of the page.
Also on this front you can create "hybrid PDF" documents, which combine the typical graphics of the Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or a text processor.
Collaboration is an element that has received several improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet you can intervene with several hands between different users, avoiding conflicts on the changes, in the word processor, each collaborator is assigned a color in the comments for better recognition during the review.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice features to the web (on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they should release the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://en.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and has been added to the English version that was on the mirrors since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD can also be sent to your home or workplace.
And if the theme of gratuitousness can be a driving force for the diffusion in the homes, it is precisely in the business field that Open Office the suite tries the big bet, already being able to count on several projects realized in the public administration and in the schools.
And there is no shortage of companies that offer an ideal training, consulting and assistance service for small and medium-sized companies, which could open up business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the videowriting equivalent of Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for the emulation presentations of Powerpoint; Dbase, as in the case of the most famous Access is the program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, is finally the graphic module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that today we are at almost 3 million and 600 thousand, with the release of the new version it is likely that we can also exceed the expected figure.
Kohl is also the fourth case of doping.
New case of positivity at the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, the Gerolsteiner team, third place and winner of the best climber jersey.
The news is reported on the website of the newspaper L'Equipe.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth positive rider at Cera, the third generation EPO, after the Italians Riccardo Ricc<0xC3><0xB2> and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, also of Gerolsteiner.
The tests on Kohl’s blood samples are among those carried out in recent weeks by laboratories in Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-analyses confirm the positive results at Cera, the Austrian will lose third place at the Tour and will face two years of canonical disqualification.
To confirm the news of Kohl's positivity to the EPO of third generation is the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who informed the Associated Press that he had notified the positivity to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed on the final podium behind Spaniard Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, also winning the polka dot jersey for best climber.
IMMIGRATES:NEW YORK TIMES ASKS, IS ITALY RACISM?
Italy "as a country of emigrants has only recently become a privileged destination for immigrants" reluctantly welcomed.
This is what the New York Times asks in a long article that dedicated a long article to the debate on the topic of racism in Italy starting from the case of the young Abdul William Guibre, originally from Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case highlights what Nyt calls the “northern paradox”: the northern regions are at the same time those where “more integration and more work” is recorded but also the “highest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the highest support for the Northern League”.
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, Nyt also cited episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only that.
The new legislation wanted by the League that tightens the brakes on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of illegal immigrants is also cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
This trend was underlined by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano meeting Benedict XVI at the Quirinale asked that the State and the Church work together to defeat racism".
Students victims of car-rents up to 900 euros for a room
The student housing market is not in crisis.
According to the latest survey by Sunia, the tenants’ union, taking a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now taken on a very serious character to the point of excluding entire swathes of young people from the right to study for the very high overall costs that families of origin should bear - explains the head of the studies office of Sunia, Laura Mariani - in these cities the strong demand from students has so deformed the market as to trigger a process of generalized increase also for the residents ".
In the majority of cases the offers of rent then contain a series of violations: contracts of free type, unregistered, without limit of fee, sub-rents connected.
For Sunia, extraordinary measures are needed which, through the revision of the tax system, can bring down prices.
Looking at the detail of the survey, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, it takes about 450 euros; for a single room it goes from a minimum of 650 (Black Bands area) to an average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera area) to a maximum of 900 (in the Vittoria area).
In Florence a bed costs on average 350/400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in the areas near the University, they need 250/280 euros for a bed in a double, from 370 to 500 for a single.
In Rome in areas close to the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) are asked about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a bed in a double.
Values only slightly lower (550 euros for a single room) in areas close to the other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecitt<0xC3><0xA0>).
You only save if you move to peripheral areas: 300 euros for a bed and 450 a single in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar areas.
In Naples for a bed you need 300/450 euros, for a room you spend from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the areas Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari for a bed you need 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single.
In smaller cities prices are lower in absolute terms, but have a greater weight in the city economy.
In the cities where the phenomenon of rents to non-EU students is more frequent, as in Perugia, there is finally a further anomaly: the increase of about 25/30% of the fee charged to foreign students compared to that applied to Italians.
Farewell old cinema Paradise, the cities erase the historic cinemas
Historical movie theaters close in favor of the Multiplex.
“A city without movie theaters is a blind city, it’s like a face without eyes.”
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore effectively photographs what is happening in large Italian urban centers but also in the cities of the province.
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the birth in the periphery of large multisalts and the consequent death by consumption of monosalts in the central areas of the cities, is one of those events that appear to us ineluctable and incontrovertible but also has all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
“It is as if a friend, an acquaintance with whom we shared a piece of the road and many emotions, were missing,” observes the director of Nuovo cinema Paradiso, the film that twenty years ago earned Tornatore the Oscar and the Grand Prix of the Cannes jury, and that perhaps told the poetry of a provincial hall and the nostalgia for a way of life.
The figures provided by Anec, the main association of exhibitors, speak for themselves: in the last five years 316 traditional cinemas have closed, and the biggest payoff is mainly the cinemas in the main cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closures, Emilia-Romagna stands out with 82 single-screen cinemas lost, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And to show that the first responsible for their disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, these are the three Italian regions that have recorded the largest number of new multiplex cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 both in Tuscany and in Emilia-Romagna.
<0xC2><0xAB>The Italian exercise has developed irrationally<0xC2><0xBB>, observes Paolo Protti, president of Anec, <0xC2><0xAB>it is useful that new structures are built but we should guarantee the survival of those already existing, because when a city hall closes, not all its visitors are willing to move into the multiplexes.
Not to mention the lack of allocation for the fund in favor of the merchants: the previous debt of the State is about 10 million euros.
It is shameful, from the ethical and moral point of view, that the Government does not respect existing laws.
To support the sector would need between 16 and 18 million euros per year".
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, worried about closures, has decided to run for cover with the signing of a protocol between the Municipality and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy, to protect and promote single-screen cinemas both in the historic center and in the suburbs.
Among the rules, there are tax relief measures for operators and advantages for the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the restricted traffic area and will have special rates for parking and in some parking lots.
<0xC2><0xAB>It is an initiative that I like<0xC2><0xBB> observes Giuseppe Tornatore<0xC2><0xBB>and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by putting in place other measures.
It is certain, however, that in order to counteract the overpowering of multiplexes, traditional theatres must also improve the quality of sound and image, because today's audiences are more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the Supercinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make "Nuovo cinema Paradiso", which I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass in front of the Rialto or the Quirinale of Via Nazionale now closed, where I have lived so many shared emotions, not to see the billboards blackened by the dust I turn to the other side.
Ties between politics and 'Ndrangheta arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to standardize the choices of the municipality to the interests of the so-called Piromalli".
The charges against the mayor and deputy mayor of Gioia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competition in a mafia association, are serious.
In handcuffs also Gioacchino Piromalli, the elderly mediator between the clan and the public administrations, and his nephew lawyer, homonymous of the boss, already condemned for association for mafia-like delinquency, condemned to compensate 10 million euros.
"In defiance of any legal and moral norms, as well as common sense," the prosecutors write, the two local administrations had expressed the will to pay advice to the lawyer Piromalli.
"It would have been thus granted to the cosca - the judges write - to enter officially inside the municipalities facilitating the possibilities, already enormous, of control and address of the public administration".
The president of the Calabrian regional junta Agazio Loiero does not hide that "collusions between local authorities and organized crime" in his region: "There are areas where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressures of the 'Ndrangheta, heroes who keep themselves clean."
The arrests this morning follow those of last July with which the police announced that they had decapitated the sock Piromalli.
Since the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro was dissolved but already in 1991, and always due to alleged conditioning between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been relieved of the task of administering the municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the UDC at the time of the dissolution, was elected leader of a center-right coalition after the May 2006 ballot.
He screamed at the scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the city council.
He called into question the then Deputy Minister of the Interior Marco Minniti, accusing him of having architected the whole thing for a political issue, but the judges, in the arrest warrant signed this morning, explain that the so-called Piromalli had even come to ask for the variation of the A3 project.
From the environmental interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, the pms write, it emerged "the willingness to marry the needs of an entrepreneur, representative of a wider group known to be close to the Piromalli, aligning the choices of the public administration to the interests of the Cosca".
When the energy comes from the waves now the big ones come down in the field
It is an endless field, which occupies more than 70% of the planet's surface and is now being discovered by the world's major energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources on which they have set their eyes, and now they are trying to get their hands on giants like the Chevron.
The possibility of obtaining energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for a hundred years and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil fell, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put aside, but now environmentalist demands and the new increase in oil give impetus to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15 percent of the world’s electricity needs could be met by sea-wave power plants.
This amount would be double that currently produced by nuclear power plants.
And then there would be the currents and the tides.
Colossus on the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build a plant in northern Portugal.
When the deal was announced, it seemed like a revolutionary step.
Two years later to bet on marine energy are more and more and among these companies always devoted to traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying ocean energy technologies," a spokesman for a subsidiary of the U.S. oil giant told the Wall Street Journal, "and is considering cooperating with us."
The cooperation in question concerns obtaining a permit from the U.S. Energy Commission, which is necessary to start a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
This is not a small signal, especially considering that in Alaska the United States continues to extract oil and recently President Bush has initiated a plan for new drilling.
In addition to the Chevron there are Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey to take the road of the energy that comes from the sea and the sums invested so far, although not known in detail, indicate according to observers a rising interest.
Technology to be developed.
Experts speak of a technology still in its infancy, also because marine energy does not escape all doubts about the environmental impact.
For now, plants such as the Portuguese one or some in Scotland are small and do not seem to create major problems for the ecosystem.
To produce energy on a large scale, however, technologies with a greater environmental impact must be used.
And the choices are different: the Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of buoys connected to each other.
The thrust of the waves, which makes the buoys move up and down is converted into hydraulic pressure by pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
The pressure spins a turbine which in turn powers a generator.
The electricity is sent to shore through submarine cables.
At the moment there are four such plants under design, awaiting only federal approval and part of the energy could be used for a military installation.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces power for a shopping mall and a parking lot using six underwater turbines in the East River in New York.
The movement of the water when the tides turn the turbine blades, creating a rotary motion that powers a generator.
Verdant said it has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to take advantage of the energy.
After the waves, the tides.
Of particular interest, they tell the Institute for Electricity Research, right now deserves the potential of the tides.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as an energy source.
It is precisely on tidal energy that states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others bordering the coasts, have already invested 7 and a half million dollars in 2008 and planned investments of up to 35 million for 2009.
