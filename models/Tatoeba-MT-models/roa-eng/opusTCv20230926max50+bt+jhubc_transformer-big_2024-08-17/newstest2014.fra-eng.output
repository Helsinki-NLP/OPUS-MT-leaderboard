Spectacular "wingsuit" jump above Bogota
Sportsman Jhonathan Florez jumped Thursday from a helicopter over Bogota, the Colombian capital.
Equipped with a wingsuit, it passed at 160 km/h above the famous Monserrate sanctuary, located at more than 3,000 meters above sea level, where many spectators had gathered to observe its feat.
A black box in your car?
While U.S. road network planners are struggling to find the money needed to repair the crumbling highway infrastructure, many envision a solution in the form of a small black box that attaches above the dashboard of your car.
The devices, which record every mile traveled by a motorist and relay the information to officials, are at the center of a controversial attempt in Washington and in government planning offices to overhaul the outdated funding system for major U.S. roads.
The generally uninteresting sector of major axis planning has suddenly provoked a very lively debate and turbulent alliances.
Libertarians have joined environmental groups to lobby for the government to use the little boxes to keep track of the miles you drive, and eventually the road you drive on, and then use the information to draft a tax bill.
The Tea Party is over.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expresses its concern about the protection of privacy.
And while members of Congress can’t agree on whether to continue, several states haven’t waited.
They are looking at how, over the next decade, they will be able to move to a system that allows drivers to pay based on the number of miles driven.
Thousands of motorists have already loaded these black boxes, sometimes equipped with a GPS monitoring system, for an experimental trip.
This is truly essential for our nation.
“It’s not like we have a choice,” said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Association of Governments, which expects the state to begin recording miles driven by every Californian motorist by 2025.
There will be a change in the way we pay these taxes.
The technology is there to do that.
The pressure comes from the fact that the country’s Highway Trust Fund, funded with the taxes Americans pay at the pump, is financially drained.
Americans don't buy as much gasoline as they used to.
Cars can travel more miles with a gallon.
The federal tax itself, which is 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased in 20 years.
Politicians are reluctant to raise the tax, even by 1 cent, while gas prices are high.
“The gas tax is just not sustainable,” said Lee Munnich, a transportation policy specialist at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently had trackers installed on 500 cars to test a mile-by-mile payment system.
“It turns out to be the most logical long-term alternative,” he said.
Wonks calls this a mileage fee.
Not surprisingly, the idea appeals to city liberals, since taxes could be used to change driving habits to reduce congestion and gas emissions, for example.
California planners are interested in the system as they develop strategies to meet the goals set in the state’s ambitious global warming laws.
But Rep. Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), chairman of the House Transportation Committee, said he also sees it as the most viable long-term alternative.
Reason Foundation’s free-market supporters also appreciate the idea of charging drivers by the mile.
“This isn’t just a tax going into a big black hole,” said Adrian Moore, vice president of policy at the Reason Foundation.
People pay more directly for the benefits they get.
The move is also backed by two former U.S. Transportation Secretaries who, in a 2011 report, urged Congress to go the payment-by-the-mile route.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year that would have involved about 10,000 cars.
But the House Speaker killed the proposal, responding to concerns from rural lawmakers representing voters who have to travel many miles every day to get to work or town.
However, several states and major cities are making progress on their side.
The most determined is Oregon, which has mobilized 5,000 drivers to conduct the most important experience in the country.
These drivers will soon pay the state mileage fees instead of gas taxes.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is considering one.
Illinois is testing a limited number of trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 agencies involved in road transportation in states along the U.S. east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) is studying how it could implement the change.
The concept is not a universal success.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer motorists recently equipped their cars with a device, drivers were concerned that the government might follow their every move.
“Worries about Big Brother and things like that are a big problem,” said Alauddin Khan, who heads strategic performance management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
It's not something people want.
From the start of the trial, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: “It would be relatively easy to turn these devices into full-fledged tracking devices.”
There is no need to build a huge and cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of people's daily comings and goings.
Nevada is among the few states now scrambling to find affordable technology that would allow the state to know how many miles a car travels, but without knowing the exact location or time.
If we can do that, Khan added, citizens will be more comfortable.
The search for this technology has led some state agencies to call on a small California startup called True Mileage.
Originally, the company was not intended to help motorists who pay taxes to the states.
It was looking to break into the emerging auto insurance market, where drivers would pay based on their mileage.
But the devices it tests have appealed to planners of major axes because they do not use GPS and provide a limited amount of information, downloaded periodically by modem.
“People will be more inclined to do that if you don’t record their speed and locate them,” said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
Major errors have been made in the pilot programmes of some States.
There are much less expensive and less intrusive ways to proceed.
In Oregon, planners try the experience by offering motorists different choices.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
They can still choose not to have a device at all, preferring instead to pay a plan based on the average number of miles traveled by all residents of the state.
Other states hope to sell the concept to wary citizens by allowing devices to do more, rather than not enough.
In New York City, transportation officials are looking to develop a taxation scheme that would also be equipped to pay for parking fees, provide “pay-per-drive” insurance, and create a real-time speed data set from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic jams.
"Drivers would be incentivized to participate because of the benefits the system offers them," said a town planning document.
However, some transportation planners wonder if the whole pay-per-mile debate is just a huge diversion.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission of the San Francisco Bay Area, officials say Congress could very simply handle the bankruptcy of the Highway Trust Fund by raising taxes on gasoline.
A single or additional annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid vehicles and others whose vehicles do not consume much gasoline, so that everyone pays their fair share.
“There’s no need to resort to radical surgery when you just need aspirin,” Randy Rentschler, the committee’s director of legislation and public affairs, said in a statement.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists will worry about their privacy and a lot of other things.
David Bowie: four unreleased songs
The English musician has not finished surprising this year.
Starting with The Next Day, released in January, he has concocted a luxury reissue scheduled for November 4, with several unreleased.
Four have already emerged on the web.
The announcement of the release of a new album by David Bowie had left everyone stunned.
On his 66th birthday, January 8, 2013, he said that a new album would be released in March.
After ten years of silence (the last record, Reality, dates from 2003) and too few appearances in public, the English musician proved that we could still count on him to make the pop scene sparkle.
A Feast for His Fans
Not tired of surprises, David Bowie had more than one trick in his bag with The Next Day.
The Thin White Duke will reissue the album on November 4.
For the occasion, he concocted a real feast for his fans.
This reissue, titled The Next Day Extra, will be available as three discs: the original album, unreleased studio sessions and remixes, as well as a DVD containing the four clips already unveiled.
The Next Day Extra will contain a total of ten additional tracks compared to the original album: the three tracks of the Deluxe edition, five songs specially unveiled for the occasion, as well as two remixes.
David Bowie also made the presentations of this beautiful box in a video.
He introduces both each of the records, but also the accessories provided with: exclusive photos and covers, a notebook to share his own impressions, a booklet with the lyrics...
And, above all, it gives a taste of his new track Atomica, typically in the vein of The Next Day, with guitars very forward and a rock electricity skillfully mastered.
Unreleased already listening
But Atomica is not the only title to reveal its charms.
The Informer, Like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFO are also available on the web.
The Informer is double-sided: a disturbing intro before a bright cavalcade that gradually slows down to give way to a pop ballad.
On Like A Rocket Man, did Bowie want to make a small reference to Elton John’s Rocket Man, or even Gravity?
With this playful title, the singer seems in his element when he no longer has his feet on the ground.
Space Oddity, next door, was much more serious.
On Born In A UFO, David Bowie once again makes reference to his strangeness: would he come from another planet?
The guitar riffs, mesmerizing, make you want to leave the Earth.
Bowie has fun in any case to play the chameleon with these titles: turn by turn informant, man on board a rocket, Martian potential...
He hides and reveals both, plays to adopt different personalities, as he has done throughout his career, including with his characters Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.
No wonder he has a mask in his hand in the photograph of the Louis Vuitton Invitation to Travel campaign, of which he embodies the new face.
It will appear in one of their commercials, broadcast from November 10.
Defence Minister Rob Nicholson insisted that wounded soldiers were not summarily released from the Canadian Armed Forces, and stressed that a transition process was being followed by all soldiers before they returned to civilian life.
Attacked by the Liberals and New Democrats in the House of Commons, Nicholson said that before their release, members of the military were following a transition plan in collaboration with their superiors.
All wounded soldiers are receiving appropriate care for their return to civilian life and none of them are released until they are ready, he said.
Critics accuse the government of wanting to save money by not allowing injured servicemen – who do not meet the military’s “universality of service” rule requiring staff to be able to perform a variety of tasks – to reach the 10-year eligibility period required for retirement benefits.
They cited two cases reported by The Canadian Press, including that of a soldier released last Friday.
Corporal David Hawkins, a reservist in London, Ont., with post-traumatic stress disorder, was released from the military despite his request to stay one more year in order to receive a fully indexed retirement.
His case followed that of Corporal Glen Kirkland, who told a parliamentary committee last month that he had been pushed out before he was ready because he did not meet the universal service rule.
Hawkins stressed that a soldier could be prepared to leave, with plans and consultation sessions, but that it was totally different than wanting to leave the ranks.
“I told them I wasn’t ready,” he said in an interview with The Canadian Press on Wednesday.
I asked for months if there was a way for me to stay, and they said no.
Since the start of the major fighting in Afghanistan, the army has struggled to determine how much latitude it can give to wounded soldiers who want to stay in the ranks but are unfit for combat.
Under the current rules, seriously wounded soldiers have up to three years to recover.
If they do not meet the criteria for overseas deployments, they may be forced to leave the military.
Data presented to Parliament last year indicate that of the 1,218 soldiers released for medical reasons, 199 had not reached the length of service required to obtain retirement benefits.
Liberal veterans’ critic Jim Karygiannis on Wednesday called for the reinstatement of Corporal Hawkins, while New Democrat Jack Harris called for an immediate end to “this shameful practice.”
Disney is betting on tablets to launch an animated series
The American media and entertainment group Disney has decided to privilege tablets to its own television channels for the upcoming release of a new children's series.
The first nine episodes of Sheriff Callie's Wild West will be available from November 24 on watchdisneyjunior.com or via its app for phones and tablets.
Its worldwide launch on Disney Group channels is only scheduled for 2014, details the statement of its Disney Junior division.
The cartoon, aimed at children from 2 to 7 years old, tells the adventures of the cat Callie, sheriff of a city in the American West where she rules the order with a magical lasso.
Each episode consists of two 11-minute stories.
“Interacting with smartphones and tablets is second nature to kids today,” Albert Cheng, vice president of digital products at Disney/ABC Television Group, said in a statement.
This type of experience is part of Disney’s efforts to “extend the lifespan of its series and build new relationships with its audience through digital platforms that are increasingly important,” he added.
A survey published earlier this week by Common Sense Media showed an explosion in mobile device use by young children in the United States: 38% of those under 2 years old have already used a tablet or phone, and 72% of those under 8 years old, compared to 10% and 38% respectively two years ago.
Snowden is ready to “cooperate” with Germany on the issue of US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the whistleblower for the US intelligence services, said he was willing to travel to Berlin to testify before the German parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander did not provide answers about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Str<0xC3><0xB6>bele met with Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he enjoys the right of asylum, to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter the MP presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, Mr Snowden said: “Although the result of my efforts has obviously been positive, my government continues to treat the difference of opinion as a leak and seeks to penalise political discourse with charges against which it is impossible to defend itself.”
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Snowden wrote that he believed that the support of the international community could persuade the U.S. government to drop the criminal charges against him.
As part of the complaint filed by the U.S. Department of Justice, he is accused of espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, Germany’s interior minister, told Zeit Online: “If Mr. Snowden is willing to talk to German officials, we will make sure to make that possible.”
Relations between the United States and Germany have been strained following complaints that the NSA tapped German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s mobile phone.
Thomas Oppermann, the MP who heads the parliamentary group overseeing foreign intelligence services, said that if there was a chance to hear Mr Snowden as a witness “without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the United States,” it should be taken advantage of.
German Green MP Str<0xC3><0xB6>bele posted a picture of him with Snowden on his Twitter account.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Str<0xC3><0xB6>bele said that according to the former NSA consultant’s lawyer, Mr. Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Mr Snowden were to testify in Germany, he would have to be given the assurance that he would be “safe” there, the MP said.
Snowden wrote in his letter that he had been subjected to a “serious and sustained” campaign of persecution that had forced him to leave his country.
However, he said he had been encouraged by the global reaction to “my act of political expression”.
Citizens around the world as well as senior officials – including in the United States – have deemed the disclosure of an inexplicable system of permanent surveillance to be in the public interest.
The letter makes an offer of cooperation with the German authorities “when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved”.
Cogeco Cable could soon offer interactive TV
Cogeco Cable subscribers may well have access to apps like Facebook, Twitter and ultimately the Netflix video-on-demand service via their TV in the not-so-distant future.
The Cogeco subsidiary said Thursday that it is currently conducting preliminary tests of the beta version of this platform with some of its users.
"This will allow us to showcase more user-friendly interfaces as well as more options," Louis Audet, president and CEO of Cogeco, said in an interview.
Cogeco Cable is thus following in the footsteps of its competitors, such as Bell, even though the Cogeco subsidiary does not yet have a precise date for this new platform.
"We must adapt and change or resist change and fail," Audet said.
The ultimate goal is to provide tools that our customers do not currently have access to.
Telecommunications giant Rogers has already indicated that it could offer Netflix if certain technical details, which were not mentioned, could be settled.
In the United States, the popular video service says it is in talks with some major cable companies to make its service available via their streaming platforms.
The CEO of Cogeco and Cogeco Cable also welcomed the Harper government's announcement in his Speech from the Throne on October 16.
Ottawa wants to force cable and satellite providers to offer customers the option to pay for pay-per-view services.
“It’s been about two and a half years since we said that the idea of forcing consumers to buy large packages of channels, it doesn’t work,” Audet said.
He hoped, however, that the consultations conducted by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) would lead to interesting recommendations.
"There will have to emerge from these discussions a kind of new frame of reference to define our new Canadian cultural policy with respect to television," said Cogeco's CEO.
The CRTC has been consulting with the public since last week and they are expected to continue with the industry next spring.
On the earnings side, Cogeco reported net income of $43.8 million in the fourth quarter, or 82<0xC2><0xA2> per share.
This is a decrease from net income of $44.9 million, or 83<0xC2><0xA2> per share, for the same period last year.
The Montreal-based company explains this decline by amortization costs related to new acquisitions.
In 2012, Cogeco acquired the U.S.-based cable company Atlantic Broadband for $1.36 billion.
This was the first major acquisition of the company after the one that had failed in Portugal.
Last December, the Montreal-based company also purchased Peer 1 Network Enterprises, a Vancouver-based Internet provider, for $526 million.
As for Cogeco’s revenues, they grew by 41.5% in the fourth quarter to reach 504.7 million.
They are $1.8 billion for the current fiscal year.
Net income from its main subsidiary, Cogeco Cable, was 43.9 million, or 90<0xC2><0xA2> per share, down from 45.7 million, or 93<0xC2><0xA2> per share, in the same period last year.
However, Cogeco Cable’s revenues increased by 45% to reach 470.4 million.
The company lost 15,237 customers in the fourth quarter.
However, for fiscal year 2013, the number of Cogeco Cable customers increased by 5,546.
Mr. Audet is not concerned that the number of clients will fluctuate in this way.
For me, this is not an indication of a change in trend, he observed.
It varies from quarter to quarter with fierce competition.
From horse to beef products
Horse meat has been found in cans of beef products sold by two small UK retailers at low prices, the agency in charge of food hygiene said today.
Routine tests revealed that the products, developed in January in Romania and sold by the Home Bargains and Quality Save chains, contained horse DNA to the tune of 1 to 5%.
“As horse meat is not mentioned in the list of ingredients, it should not have been present in the product,” the agency said.
A scandal over the presence of horsemeat in cooked dishes broke out in Europe earlier this year, following tests carried out in Ireland.
According to reviews by the European Commission, France has been the country most affected by the presence of this type of meat in products supposed to contain only beef.
A collision between two vehicles injured four people early Friday on Route 131 in Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re.
Shortly before 4 a.m., a motorist driving north, in Saint-Félix-de-Valois, lost control of his vehicle and collided with a car arriving in the other direction.
All four occupants of the two vehicles were injured, but there was no fear for their lives.
Traffic returned to normal at 6 a.m. on Friday.
Frontier Airlines plans to charge for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge passengers carrying carry-on baggage on its flights up to $100.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for carry-on luggage and $2 for coffee or soda, though in its announcement Wednesday, it indicated that passengers could take the unopened can with them to the plane’s descent.
The new carry-on baggage charges are for bags stored in the upper compartment, so small bags installed under the seat will always be free.
Frontier said it would charge $25 if the fees were paid in advance and $100 if travelers only paid once at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee was intended to encourage travelers to pay the fees in advance.
“We don’t want to charge that price,” she explained.
Airlines began charging for the first and second checked bags in 2008.
Passengers who tried to avoid these charges would put as much as they could into the carry-on bags stored in the overhead bins, so there was often no room left in these bins.
These fees are a way to ensure that passengers carry fewer things on board.
O'Malley said the new fees won't really be used to raise money.
It is about making it clear to the most loyal Frontier customers that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find space in the upper compartments.
Passengers who purchase their ticket on the airline's website will not have to pay.
Thus, a passenger queuing at a Frontier boarding gate could carry a bag for free, while the next person in the queue might have to pay $100 for a similar bag.
O'Malley explained that Frontier's website and check-in procedures are changing to ensure that passengers are aware of these fees before arriving at the gate.
Frontier’s hand baggage fees will not be applied until the summer, although no date has been set.
Passengers often snarl about baggage fees and other charges, but airlines love them.
They believe that baggage handling costs are significant and that passengers who want this service should pay for it.
Many people on Wall Street see the addition of baggage fees as a sign that airlines are charging enough to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
However, many of them did not pay for their luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. had applied the first hand baggage charges three years ago, and the low-cost airline Allegiant followed a little later.
The only other airline imposing such fees is Hungary’s Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely tracks the surcharge.
He estimated, in a December 2011 report, that Spirit’s carry-on costs were worth $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executive, recently traveled on Spirit and wondered what he would find at the boarding gate as passengers discovered the company’s unusual carry-on baggage charges.
“I’ve never seen such a smooth boarding procedure in my entire professional career,” he said.
I expected to see gnashing of teeth and a fight break out at the door.
The plane was full, he added, “passengers boarded at lightning speed.”
Frontier also does like Spirit and charges a $2 fee for a coffee, tea, soda, or fruit juice.
Frontier said passengers who have a soda or juice can take the unopened can with them, and those who have coffee can be reserved for free.
It will always distribute water for free.
US Airways briefly attempted to charge for drinks in 2008 but backtracked seven months later after passengers complained and when no other major airline had followed.
Frontier’s decision to charge hand baggage fees when passengers do not purchase their ticket directly from the airline is its latest effort to entice customers to go to its site.
Airlines pay online travel sellers like Orbitz $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This has prompted all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly from them instead of going to an online travel agency.
However, Frontier went further in this area.
In September, it began offering only half loyalty miles to customers who bought their ticket through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, she cut mileage bonuses by 25% on a trip.
For example, a 1,000-mile Frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency would earn 250 miles.
It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they purchase their ticket directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in her hometown of Denver, but her business is shrinking and she is losing money.
Revenues fell 9% and its flight capacity declined nearly 13% in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by its parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic attempted to fix Frontier's finances by selling the airline.
The NSA blames an “internal error” and not hackers for the failure of its site
The shadowy National Security Agency said Friday it was a bug that caused its public site to crash for a few hours, not hackers as some had claimed online.
“NSA.gov remained inaccessible for a few hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during a planned update,” the spy agency said in an emailed statement.
The problem will be solved tonight.
Allegations that the outage was due to a Distributed Denial of Service (DSD) attack are false.
Earlier tonight, online server trackers noted that the NSA site had been down for at least 6 hours, and some users still can’t access the site.
Earlier, an NSA spokesman told ABC News that the agency’s sensitive internal network was “not at all” compromised.
No classified information is at risk, the spokesman said.
At least one group of online hacktivists claimed to be responsible for the breakdown of the NSA site by a DSD attack.
DSD attacks aim to flood a targeted site until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses.
Cyber-tactics are not very sophisticated and attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the targeted system.
The once top-secret NSA, once dubbed the “No Such Agency,” has found itself in the spotlight and heavily criticized over the past few months following a wave of revelations about its vast communications surveillance programs at home and abroad — which are part of the NSA’s secret files stolen from the agency and leaked by the former consultant.
This growing controversy around the agency has sparked much speculation that tonight’s incident was the result of a targeted cyber-operation.
Delta Downtown now closed
The Delta Centre-Ville hotel closed its doors Thursday in Montreal, after 36 years of existence.
The investment fund that owned the building sold it to developers who will turn it into student residences.
Three hundred and fifty people worked at the hotel.
Of those, 200 have yet to find a new job.
Delta promises not to let its employees down.
Employers came to meet with employees directly on site, employees were met individually to assess their needs.
“This support will continue for the next six months,” said Felix Bisson, Delta Hotels’ regional director of labor relations.
The closing of the Delta takes place in a very competitive hotel market.
The investment fund that owned that building had choices to make.
Either he reinvested in the building to continue operating it, so there were investments of tens of millions while the competition is very fierce, there are many new hotels that appeared in Montreal.
"Either he sold it to someone else and that's what happened," says Paul Arsenault, holder of the Transat Tourism Chair at UQAM's School of Management Sciences.
Other hotels in Montreal will also be converted in the coming months, such as the Crown Plaza, which will become a residence for the elderly.
In the meantime, four hotel projects totaling nearly 600 rooms will be launched within two years.
Titan CEO: “Goodyear Amiens acquisition project starts with zero employees”
After throwing in the towel with a bang in January for the partial takeover of the Goodyear Amiens-Nord site promised to close, Maurice Taylor, the CEO of the American tire Titan, declares today, ready to save 333 jobs out of the 1,137 that the plant has.
Arnaud Montebourg, Minister of Productive Recovery, had already announced it, Monday, October 21.
After giving up the plan to buy the factory in January, you come back today.
You had pronounced violent attacks and insults, speaking of "so-called workers", who "work three hours" a day, of "crazy" unions, targeting the CGT.
We don't understand this flip-flop.
Is it to please Mr. Montebourg?
I'm not trying to please anyone.
Except for my wife.
Mr. Montebourg, is a charming young man trying to save some of the highest paid industrial jobs.
If I hurt anyone with my words, I'm sorry.
But France has a high level of tax and unemployment as well.
Does the truth hurt you?
Working seven hours a day when in other countries you work eight hours handicaps France.
In India, China and many other countries, people work ten to twelve hours a day.
I have no preconceptions about France.
What I see is a factory that makes good agricultural tires, has good equipment, is well located and has spaces to expand.
Why does Titan need this factory so badly?
Titan doesn't need to buy this factory.
But, with the right price and skilled workers, it’s worth a try.
What kind of agreement do you expect between the CGT and Goodyear?
If, since the announcement of the plant's closure, Goodyear had offered employees a good severance package, I think 100% of the employees would have accepted it.
Now, let's imagine Titan buys the closed plant from Goodyear.
Titan could then move the machines to Poland or any other European Union country that still has its own currency.
I think Mr Montebourg knows that.
However, he wants to keep the Amiens factory with at least 333 well-paid jobs.
Titan agrees to recruit them from Goodyear’s current 1,200 or so employees.
So Mr. Montebourg needs an engagement from Titan before he tries to get the CGT to sit at the table with Goodyear.
The first step is for CGT and Goodyear to sign a severance agreement for all employees.
As a result, there will no longer be any employees in the plant.
Mr. Montebourg said that you were prepared to guarantee these 333 jobs for four years.
Do you confirm that?
The only number I mentioned to the minister was 333.
I know he'd like a four-year warranty.
But, as I told you, the CGT and Goodyear must first agree on severance pay.
If all employees accept them, the plant purchase project starts with zero employees.
How can we give guarantees of duration of employment when there are no more employees on the site?
If Mr. Montebourg manages to get the CGT and Goodyear to agree and Titan buys the plant, we intend to stay in Amiens-Nord for more than four years.
Bombardier’s profit declines as aircraft deliveries and orders decline
Bombardier Inc, a Canadian aircraft and rail manufacturer, reported a 15 percent drop in net profit on Thursday, under pressure from lower orders and aircraft deliveries in the third quarter and contract problems in its Trains division.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not provide flight test data for its brand-new CSeries aircraft or information on whether the aircraft will meet its ambitious commercial commissioning schedule before next September.
After the inaugural flight of the test aircraft about a month and a half ago, it flew only three times, and the question then arose as to whether the test phase was on track.
The results were not up to expectations and the share price fell by 8% on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, on Thursday downgraded his rating from "outperformance" to "sector performance" due to the low potential for the stock market to rise over the next quarter or two.
“While the decline in aircraft deliveries was largely anticipated, we are really disappointed by the profit margin in the Transportation division,” Cameron Doerksen said in a note to customers.
We expect Bombardier to place new orders for its CSeries aircraft as the flight test program progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes the CSeries family of aircraft will be able to catapult it into the lower segment of a market now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delays.
However, the number of firm orders for CSeries aircraft so far is modest at 177. It seems that potential buyers are waiting for the results of flight tests to validate the company's claims regarding the energy efficiency and savings potential of the new airliner.
At present, the company has registered a total of 403 orders and purchase commitments from 15 customers and operators.
Pierre Beaudoin, President and Chief Executive Officer, is confident that Bombardier will achieve its target of 300 firm orders before the first aircraft goes into commercial service.
The leaders also reassured analysts and the media on Thursday that the program was proceeding according to schedule.
"The test aircraft did not stay on the ground any longer than expected," Beaudoin said on a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates were planned during the aircraft's downtime.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We decided to do a first flight and schedule an update period, and that's what we did.
This will be repeated throughout the flight program.
The second of the five test aircraft is expected to fly in the coming weeks, with the others to follow shortly thereafter, the company said.
Still, analysts are skeptical that the first customer could fly a CSeries aircraft just 12 months after its maiden flight.
Bombardier has indicated that it is in the process of evaluating the schedule for entry into service and will provide new information in the coming months.
“This slow pace of flight testing – although apparently in line with Bombardier’s internal schedule – reinforces our view that entry into service will be delayed to the first quarter of 2015,” said Mr. Doerksen.
In the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier’s net income fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier.
Adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenues fell slightly from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Analysts had expected earnings of 10 cents per share and revenue of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer said it delivered 45 aircraft in the quarter, up from 57 a year earlier.
Net orders fell to 26 aircraft, down from 83 previously.
The delay in the Aeronautics division amounted to $32.9 billion as of September 30, unchanged from December 31 of the previous year.
“In Aeronautics, the results were in line with our forecasts, but the low number of orders and the general market conditions were disappointing,” said Mr. Beaudoin.
Aeronautics revenues were down 13% to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest rail manufacturer, said revenue from this division had risen nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
The Transport division's backlog totaled $32.6 billion as of September 30, up slightly from December 31 of the previous year.
The Transport division's margins suffered from performance issues with a few large contracts.
Executives announced that new guidance would be provided during the fourth quarter.
Bombardier’s share price, which also announced that Patrick Pichette, Chief Financial Officer of Google Inc, will serve on the board of directors, fell 8.5% to C$4.83 on Thursday afternoon.
Brazil’s Embraer SA, the world’s third-largest aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier’s closest competitor, reported a 10% drop in quarterly profit on Thursday.
Two speleologists aged 23 and 27 were missing in a chasm under the Dent de Crolles since Thursday night, it was learned Friday at the rescue of the Is<0xC3><0xA8>re.
They were located this Friday afternoon.
The two men, one seasoned in practice and the other not, had gone underground on Thursday around 9:30 p.m. to make a crossing of the Dent de Crolles, located in the commune of Saint-Pierre-de-Chartreuse.
We haven’t heard from them since, the same source said.
"The speleologists should have left around 5 a.m.," said Thierry Larribe, technical adviser to the rescue caving agency in charge of organizing the rescue.
Dozens of people on site
About twenty rescuers, ten civilians members of the French rescue speleo, as well as gendarmes, CRS and firefighters were on site.
In the late afternoon of Friday, the two cavers were located.
"This is another group of speleologists who, after finding them exhausted but healthy in the cavity, transmitted the information to one of the rescue teams engaged in the network," explains Le Dauphiné.
The two soldiers in the 13th Battalion of the Alpine Hunters of Chambéry, were found "exhausted, but not injured".
They got lost in the network, returned to their steps while waiting for help, said the prefecture.
Refueled, they should come out of the cavity with the help of rescuers in the evening.
German journalists urged to flee Google and Yahoo
The German journalists' union on Thursday called on its members to stop using Google and Yahoo's online services in the wake of new revelations about the activities of U.S. and British intelligence services.
“The German Federation of Journalists recommends that journalists avoid using Google and Yahoo’s search and messaging engines until further notice,” it said in a statement.
According to the Washington Post, the US National Security Agency (NSA) and the British Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) have collected masses of information by infiltrating international networks that allow the two firms to synchronize their servers.
“The journalists’ searches are as confidential as the contact details of their sources and the nature of their communications with them,” added Michael Konken, president of the union, which claims 38,000 members.
Repainted fires: MP calls for Brigitte Grouwels to resign
Minister Brigitte Grouwels' project to "relift" traffic light poles in Brussels does not appeal to everyone.
As a reminder, the Brussels Minister of Public Works and Transport launched this Thursday in the center of Brussels a test project consisting of repainting 16 poles of traffic lights in the region in the yellow and blue colors of Brussels.
The aim is both to "increase security" and "Brussels identity".
The idea is, eventually, to repaint all the traffic lights in Brussels, for an estimated cost of about one million euros.
But the blue chosen by the minister is "too dark", according to Brussels deputy Emmanuel De Bock who speaks of "flamandization" of the capital and demands the "resignation" of Brigitte Grouwels.
"Not content to spend the money of the Brussels people madly in operations of relifting of the signal posts in the colors of the Brussels Region, Brigitte Grouwels continues its operations of Flemishization of the Capital," says Mr. De Bock in a statement.
After her yellow-mango-black taxis, she finally repainted the Brussels poles herself in dark yellow-blue-black.
According to the MEP, there is now "no longer any difference in visual continuity between Flanders and Brussels".
The people of Brussels deserve better than to see their money wasted by a CD&V minister who carries out the NVA program herself.
It is high time to stop the Trojan horse of Flanders.
"As a reminder, Brigitte Grouwels was only elected with 2,245 votes, or 0.5% of Brusselsers!" concludes Mr. De Bock.
the Portico of Pont-de-Buis
The ecotax portico of Pont-de-Buis, around which a violent demonstration of opponents of this tax took place on Saturday, was dismantled on Thursday morning.
Cranes arrived shortly after 10 a.m., and traffic on the national highway was diverted in the process.
The decision of the dismantling, announced by the prefecture of Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re on Wednesday, was taken by the company Ecomouv, manager of the portico.
This is the last of the three ecotax gantries in operation in the department of Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re, the other two having been dismantled or sabotaged.
Launch of an accessory store for Google Glass
An online store, offering multiple accessories dedicated to Google Glass, has just been made available to thousands of developers with a prototype of the glasses signed by Google.
They can thus acquire an earphone, a charger or even a storage case.
This store, strictly reserved for developers who already have Google Glass, offers some accessories such as a charger and its USB cable, for $ 50.
For the same price, it is also possible to acquire a protective cover made of micro-fibers or an in-ear earphone.
Although Google is currently working on a model of Google Glass equipped with correction glasses, no large-scale commercialization date has yet been confirmed.
It's been five years since my father disappeared from the world of the living.
At first I denied his death, I was talking about him in the present,
I was so afraid to forget it or rather I did not know how I was going to continue to "attend" it.
There is no recipe, no instruction manual to pass the wall of the invisible and find his own.
Then signs appeared.
The first time was the strong feeling of his presence in the passenger seat while I was driving.
Another time, a gentle awakening in the middle of the night to look at his watch that never leaves me, placed on the night table.
It is the image of my smiling father that accompanies me in my daily gestures.
Our mother left us after her exhausting battle with cancer.
At least that's what I thought the day I found his body empty, cramped on that hospital bed with crumpled sheets.
Similarly, his funeral was an icy farewell focused around the meager glow of the candles that framed his coffin.
I thought she was gone.
Gradually, by small diurnal or nocturnal apparitions, a little timid, a little erased, it quickly returned to my mind, evolving as it resumed its place in the landscape of my thought that was believed to be in mourning.
And then, she revealed herself while revealing to me my own facets that I had not yet perceived, masked by my relationship with her.
So I learned and understood that I had not lost the person of my mother but simply a woman that I did not really know, a woman who embodied this person, during his stay in life.
In dying, this woman had perfected her life and freed the person I loved, and here I found her, full and whole.
This detour of the path of my life remains the most unexpected and the most beautiful.
It is a privilege to know that loved ones never leave us.
I look like my father, "inside as well as out" it seems.
I've always been told that.
I never believed it at the time.
I had a difficult relationship with him until he got old, sick.
There, I was no longer afraid of him and I was able to love him.
One day, he died.
For a long time, he accompanied me: when I stopped smoking, when I was afraid, when I hurt...
He talked to me, constantly encouraged me, he lived in my body.
I saw his hands looking at mine, I lent him my body.
But it was never indiscreet.
I could have had a personal life.
He gave me my privacy.
It took a long time and then one day he left.
Finally, it was comfortable and reassuring to be understood, encouraged, advised.
I no longer know who said that the dead are not forgotten but invisible.
My parents are gone but I feel them constantly close to me.
Every event, every moment of my life makes me feel their presence because I always refer to it: what would they have said, what would they have thought, what would they have done?
I constantly dream about them, maybe not every night but several times a week for sure.
I often dream of the last moments that I have to share with them before it is too late, only, there is always something that prevents me from accomplishing this moment.
I often wake up anxious when it happens to me and I deeply feel their absence.
Sometimes, some dreams lead me to the contrary and are part of my story and indeed, they continue to live and share my life.
The day before my ultrasound where I had to know the sex of my baby, I dreamed that I was waking up, I was hoisting myself out of bed, my father was waiting for me on the landing and he was smiling at me and rejoicing that I was expecting a little boy.
The next day, I had the feeling that he had visited me in my sleep to tell me that he was sharing with joy what was happening to me.
And of course, it was a little boy in my belly.
I enjoyed sharing this moment with him and I take pleasure in recounting this common memory lived after his death.
Five years ago, my grandmother died of cancer.
A year ago, she was on a trip with my family to Cuba.
That is to say the shock that his disappearance caused in the young bachelor that I was at the time.
I realized my grief pretty quickly.
But it continues to influence my life, especially in times when I find myself in difficulty, or when I have to make important decisions.
Learning Arabic and being interested in the Middle East, to the point of making it a master's degree in a major school, were not, in hindsight, trivial choices.
In fact, I often heard her speak Arabic as a child, and speak about Morocco, where she had lived for decades - before returning to France at the time of independence.
The values she instilled in me are still there, so I sometimes think about how she would want me to act at some point.
The same goes for my attitudes: I try to live up to the generosity and uprightness of the one who was a fervent believer.
From now on, I feel it as a daily presence, a benevolent soul, a saving spirit.
I can see his eyes on me.
My mother died nineteen years ago now.
Dead after talking to me on the phone.
I went through all the phases: misunderstanding, anger, pain, crying that triggers itself, anywhere, anytime, in unusual places, incongruous moments.
Then, time eased the pain.
The only thing that remained was the lack, this unanswered emptiness, this need for her, to confide in me, to reassure me in the depths of her sweetness.
Yet she is there, silent presence, she is there and looks at me.
Every morning, I see his worried eyes resting on me, I see the dark circles that weigh down his eyes, the fine lines around the lips that cigarettes excavate, the folds that mark the forehead on days of worry.
My mother took possession of my face and she looks at me every morning in my mirror.
And every morning, I look away.
My wife and the mother of my 3 children died of cancer at the age of 43.
We constantly feel his protection, nothing serious can happen to us.
It was his promise on his bed of pain, so we gradually learned to smile again, and to pronounce his name is no longer taboo but a comfort.
Of course, I talk to her in the dead of night when the absence hurts too much, she invites herself into my dreams when the morale is a little hit.
We feel carried and protected in difficult moments, the retreat of time makes us realize how much she was a conductor and we try to stay in the way she had traced us.
If a being has loved you very much, absence cannot tear it away from your heart and memories.
In a way, the loved one becomes your inner energy.
I lost my father on August 22, 2008 to asbestos cancer.
I was very close to him, I always acted according to what he thought or what he liked.
I could not attend his burial and three weeks after his death, I gave birth to a little boy.
If I have my convictions sometimes different from his, I always wonder if my actions are in line with his vision of things.
I have had problems in my work for these beliefs.
For me, it is impossible to go in the opposite direction, I do not sleep and I always wonder what he will think of it.
I don’t know if I adopted his way of being or if I’m just like him: is it genetic?
In any case, it will always be my reference.
It was a bit like an alter-ego, there was no need to talk to each other.
In short, he is there on a daily basis.
I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
It was almost thirty years ago that my husband died at the age of 33.
I was 28 years old and our son was 6 years old.
The immense pain that then invaded me has of course lessened but it is always close to me.
Very often it "landed" in my dreams in such a precise way, so vivid that when I woke up I was even sadder to find that it was only a dream.
The other night, he asked me if I was okay, I said no, he said "I'm coming down" but in a voice so real that I woke up in a startle, anguished and I lit the bedside lamp looking everywhere, convinced that it was going to happen.
I always live in the same house, and often I feel watched and I turn around to see if he's not there, I know it's him and I talk to him.
In every room I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
For nothing in the world I would leave this house where we were happy and or his spirit lives with me.
I am 58 years old, I have always lived alone since his departure, he is and will remain the love of my life.
I want to clarify that I am sociable with a profession to responsibility, I laugh and I sing, I go out, I am grandmother, I have many friends, but my heart and my soul belong to him and I never talk about him except with my son, and I never go to the cemetery.
Iraq: October bloodiest month since 2008
October was the deadliest month in Iraq since April 2008.
Baghdad released official figures on Friday: 964 people lost their lives last month: 855 civilians, 65 policemen and 44 soldiers.
This publication takes place on the day when the Iraqi Prime Minister is received by the US President.
Noury al-Maliki wants help from the United States.
"We don't tell the world to stand by us and support us, we have the right to ask the world because we are part of it," Maliki said Thursday in Washington.
And also because if what is happening in Iraq is not settled, it will spread, and what is happening in Syria will spread as well.
And what happens when a virus of terrorism lives? it spreads.
Noury al-Maliki was speaking at the U.S. Institute for Peace, an independent institution created by Congress.
Outside the building, protesters were protesting against the Iraqi leader.
They held up placards accusing him, among other things, of being a murderer and calling on the United States to refuse to provide him with aid.
Cocaine lawyer who informed a drug sponsor of a police investigation has been jailed
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave information to crime lord Neil Scarbrough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction would be revealed in the open
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Assize Court.
A top defense lawyer, who had informed a drug sponsor of a major police investigation because he feared his secret drug addiction would be revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, was giving sensitive information to crime lord Neil Scarbrough about investigations into his drug trafficking activities after he compromised himself because of his habit of using cocaine.
The lawyer, who was nicknamed "Bash" and considered by criminals as a "case of first importance", was arrested at his home in 2011 following police wiretapping operations directed towards Scarborough, which he had represented in a previous trial in relation to drug trafficking.
Police officers spotted Sarborough, 32, dropping off three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was attending a Law Society dinner with colleagues.
Investigations revealed that Ditta was a “regular consumer” of the Class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Over an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he sought unlawfully to obtain information on the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his associates.
The four suspects were being monitored by police at the time as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking taking place in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire counties.
Along with 32 other men, they were subsequently imprisoned after police seized heroin and cocaine for an amount of <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million, as well as over <0xC2><0xA3>200,000 in cash during a series of raids.
Ditta, 42, was providing information to criminals because he feared his drug addiction would be exposed.
Today, at the Liverpool Assize Court, Ditta, who works at Blackburn-based law firm Forbes Solicitors, has fallen out of favour after being found guilty on two counts of obstruction of justice after a three-week trial.
He had admitted possession of cocaine during a previous hearing.
The lawyer’s fall came after police, investigating Scarborough, discovered he had been in regular phone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and spotted him arriving at Ditta’s home and placing drugs, 60% pure, under the lawyer’s trash cans in a black golf glove.
Shortly after the deposition, Scarborough was in regular telephone contact with Ditta who was at a dinner at the football stadium in Ewood Park, home of the Blackburn Rovers club.
The lawyer returned home, discovered the drugs, and they called each other nine times.
The court heard that Ditta was a “regular user” of cocaine after tests showed traces of the Class A drug in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested but denied using cocaine. He said he had spoken to the alleged drug trafficker because it was his client and argued that their discussions were subject to "legal privilege".
During his arrest, Ditta picked up his wallet and tried to withdraw several credit cards, but they were all seized and a hair sample was taken from him.
During an interview, he stated that he had an office at his home and at his place of work and that clients sometimes called him at his home for legal reasons.
But the court heard testimony that he was calling major players in the drug trade, some of whom he had represented, after key arrests to tell them which investigators were aware.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: “If anyone needs to know not to break the law, it is a criminal lawyer.”
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer, and getting too involved with private clients.
The relationship we are talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer supplying drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his communications will undoubtedly be legitimate communications because he was his lawyer.
But this has gone far beyond the ordinary boundaries of a relationship between a lawyer and his client.
He obstructed the police investigation as much as he could to allow him to continue his criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not honor his profession, but dishonored it.
He got too close to some clients, especially Scarborough, and let his independence be compromised.
Ditta denied any wrongdoing and said, “If I was a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and if I had wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited 3 p.m., I would have done it immediately.”
But after the hearing, Lancashire Police Superintendent Lee Halstead said: “Mr. Ditta went from criminal lawyer to criminal himself as soon as he started procuring drugs from criminal organisations.”
His cocaine addiction compromised him forever and made him vulnerable to the ulterior motives of the leading members of organized criminal groups who tasked him with obtaining valuable information regarding police investigations.
Lawyers should observe the strictest rules of integrity and establish a climate of trust with the public.
Mr. Ditta betrayed that trust and tried to hide behind the veneer of his profession.
The Lancashire Serious and Organised Crime Unit conducted the investigation into Mr Ditta, who was found guilty on three counts of cocaine possession and now obstructing justice, testifying to his commitment to prosecuting criminals.
Let this case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is above the law.
We will find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was jailed for 14 years after pleading guilty to aiding and abetting trafficking in heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five others involved in trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug trafficking.
On his website, Ditta held a question-and-answer session about himself during which he said that his dream job would be to be a lawyer representing clients on death row in America, his last dinner guest would be Mohammed Ali and inequality would be what motivated him to work.
Aretha Franklin will return to the stage in December.
The Detroit News reports that the Queen of Soul will perform on December 21 at the Sound Board Room of the MotorCity Casino Hotel.
In November, Franklin recorded an album for Clive Davis and Sony Music, produced by Don Was and Kenny "Babyface" Edmonds.
Without specifying the illness she suffered, the famous interpreter of Respect had told the media on October 16 that the side effects of a treatment she was receiving were "difficult".
She said she was “happy to be back.”
Menton reduces the cost of its Christmas illuminations
420 reasons, 2.2 kilometers of seaside covered with a mantle of light: one could touch the heat stroke in Menton with the invoice of the illuminations.
Invoice which, unlike many municipalities, is also paid by taxpayers, and not by trade associations.
To reduce its costs, the city uses LEDs.
But also a differentiated management of the network of public lighting and Christmas decorations.
Los Angeles Airport Evacuated After Shooting
There was a shooting at the Los Angeles International Airport.
It was 10 a.m. local time when a man opened fire.
According to local police, at least two people were injured.
This would be an employee working for the U.S. Transportation Safety Administration (TSA) and the shooter.
The incident reportedly occurred at Terminal 3, causing a wave of panic.
Travelers and staff rushed to the exits or on the tarmac.
Soon the police intervened and a man suspected of being the shooter was apprehended on the roof of an airport parking lot.
The airport is being evacuated and air traffic is disrupted.
Classical singing for teenagers
Each time, it is the school clientele that will be targeted, an initiative that had been very successful during the previous season.
Through five sketches imagined and interpreted by artists of the region, vignettes with a high dose of humor, teenagers are allowed to tame classical singing.
In addition to this show, the Société d'art lyrique du Royaume will return with its Lyrical Destinations, a formula that now fills the Pulperie de Chicoutimi.
Two more concerts will take place in the summer of 2014, giving artists from the region the chance to show what they are capable of.
To these activities was added the Apéro lyrique, the benefit concert held last August, with the help of the colorature soprano Marie-<0xC3><0x88>ve Munger.
It was a benefit activity, alongside the artistic dimension, and it helped the non-profit to produce a financial balance sheet that is as sweet to the ears as a bat tune.
Without delivering precise figures, the chairman of the board, Yves Bergeron, took advantage of the press meeting held yesterday in Chicoutimi to be reassuring.
Despite the precariousness of so many cultural institutions, the future is shaping well, even in the long term.
We have stronger and more consistent support.
“The finances are in full swing and we hope to last until the 50th anniversary of the operetta, a milestone that we will cross in seven years,” said the director.
“I would even say beyond,” added the executive director, Hél<0xC3><0xA8>ne Gaudreault, smiling.
The 37-year-old man who took a child hostage at Surrey's Gabrielle Roy School faces six charges, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
Omar Moustapha Hassan has been charged with hostage-taking, kidnapping, uttering threats, carrying a weapon for a dangerous purpose, kidnapping, and failing to comply with an order.
“The rapid reactions of the police involved and their ability to defuse the situation immediately were essential to the safe conclusion of this incident,” said Corporal Bert Paquet in a statement.
Omar Hassan is still in detention and will have to appear in court on Friday.
New class action lawsuit against the Sainte-Croix brothers
A new class action lawsuit has been filed against the Sainte-Croix brothers, concerning sexual assaults that allegedly took place this time at the Saint-Joseph oratory as well as in several orphanages, colleges and schools.
The petition is based on the testimony of the applicant, identified as "J.J.", who was allegedly masturbated in the 1950s, first at Notre-Dame-des-Neiges by his teacher Brother Soumis, then by his confessor, Father Bernard, at the Oratory of Saint-Joseph, where he was a mass-servant and where his father worked as a painter.
The first appeal concerned only three institutions, and when the settlement was announced, many people told us: "I was in such a place, can I register?", says lawyer Alain Arsenault, who defends victims in both appeals.
The particularity of the class action that has just been filed is that it allows the addition of plaintiffs from any institution where abuses could have been perpetrated by members of the Congregation of the Holy Cross.
At present, the appeal gathers the complaints of 25 people who claim to have been assaulted by the Sainte-Croix brothers.
The alleged facts are generally older than those mentioned in the first appeal, since several of the institutions in question closed their doors in the 1960s.
The appeal also points out that the Congregation of the Holy Cross and the Oratory of St. Joseph, which is a separate entity, "allowed sexual abuse to be perpetrated against children", that they "exercised a moral, religious and psychological constraint on the victims", that they "were aware of the sexual abuse perpetrated", and that they nevertheless "conferred with it".
These latest accusations are based, among other things, on letters written by the lawyer of the Sainte-Croix brothers, Me <0xC3><0x89>mile Perrin, in the 1990s, but also on the research done in the archives on this subject by Brother Wilson Kennedy, a former brother of the Sainte-Croix who publicly denounced the abuses.
The class action must first pass the admissibility stage in Superior Court.
Once the admissibility has been admitted by the Court, the second stage, the hearings on the merits, are carried out.
In the case of the first appeal, the Congregation of the Holy Cross had agreed to settle amicably before hearings were held on the merits.
Significant fire in a business
A fire severely damaged a business in the Montreal borough of LaSalle on the night of Thursday to Friday.
Rescue workers were called about 1 a.m. on Friday after a fire broke out in the basement of an Indian restaurant on Dollard Avenue, near the intersection with Réjane Street.
The 30 or so firefighters who were dispatched to the scene took almost an hour to control the blaze.
The fire "caused significant damage to the structure of the building," said the head of operations of the Montreal Fire Safety Service, Richard Bordeaux.
The cause of the fire was unknown, but there was no one at the restaurant when firefighters arrived at the scene.
There were no injuries, but nearly twenty units, located on the first and second floors of this row of commercial premises, had to be evacuated.
The Red Cross has been requested, as residents of one of the apartments may have to be temporarily housed, the SIM said.
A lot of opposition to medical aid in dying at Palliative Care Congress
The Canadian Congress on Palliative Care, which is taking place this week in Ottawa, comes a few days after the vote in favour of the principle of the bill on medical assistance in dying in Quebec.
This is an opportunity for several palliative care associations to reaffirm their disagreement.
If all patients had access to effective care to alleviate their suffering, in addition to being able to stay at home, very few of them would want to end their days, according to a spokeswoman for the Canadian Palliative Care Association, Maryse Bouvette.
With a focus on palliative care in Canada, the approach to euthanasia would become minimal.
The president of the Quebec Palliative Care Network also rejects the bill on medical assistance in dying.
If adopted, Alberte Déry worries about the consequences for future generations.
"What is the meaning of life," she laments.
The majority of palliative care homes will refuse to help patients die, according to Alliance of Palliative Care Homes Vice President Suzanne Fitzback.
Ms. Fitzback, also director of Mathieu-Froment-Savoie in Gatineau, believes that the service would be unnecessary anyway.
We are never asked, “I want to die, give me an injection.”
The director of the Ontario Palliative Care Association, Rick Firth, believes that the Quebec bill is disorienting the population about the vocation of palliative care.
He does not believe that Ontario will follow suit.
For her part, the Liberal MP for Gatineau, Stéphanie Vallée, says that the notion of end of life will have to be clarified before the bill is passed.
Kenyan Press Outrages Controversial Media Law
“It is a scary country and it is legitimate to ask the question: what will prevent Parliament from sweeping away the independence of the judiciary tomorrow?” the newspaper said, challenging the bill and calling for it to be declared unconstitutional.
“This law is draconian and very punitive, and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of Capital Group – owner of CapitalFM, one of Kenya’s most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said the new media tribunal “will always be biased because it is an extension of the government” and that restrictions on content and advertising would hurt Kenya’s place in the global economy.
“I hope the president will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this bill and send it back to Parliament,” he added.
According to The Star newspaper, the new bill will allow the government to “take control of the media”, while The Standard said that democracy and freedom of opinion in Kenya “have suffered a severe blow” and castigated the bill as “draconian”.
The passage of the bill comes at the same time as a package of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the wake of the attack carried out by armed Islamists in the Westgate shopping mall last September.
Kenyan media have angered the authorities by broadcasting CCTV footage on which troops deployed at the scene of the attack allegedly stole the luxury shopping mall.
Police Chief David Kimaiyo responded by summoning two journalists and a media official to interview them, although the summons was withdrawn following a media outcry.
Under the new bill, the media could face fines of up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and journalists up to 1 million with the added risk of being “deleted” or no longer being able to receive official press accreditation.
The court also has the power to seize the property of an offender if the offender has not paid the fine.
According to the Daily Nation, “even a single fine is enough to cripple most FM stations.”
He also says the measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as Kenya’s “animated blogosphere.”
By silencing the media, politicians know they can do whatever they want with impunity.
“No one will ever know,” Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist with The Nation, wrote, describing the Kenyan media as a key source of control in public life.
Delivered to themselves, politicians would bankrupt the country and bring us back to hunting and gathering.
Kenyan lawmakers have been the target of public anger in the past.
In May, they took a stand against the cuts ordered by the National Commission in charge of salaries and restored their staggering salaries of about 532,000 shillings a month tax-exempt – which are among the highest in the world.
A difficult year for pharmacists
The departure of nearly 10 pharmacists at the Centre de santé et services sociaux (CSSS) in Laval caused quite a stir for the management of the H<0xC3><0xB4>pital de la Cité-de-la-Santé, during the year 2012-2013.
Due to multiple retirements, maternity leave or departures at all, the pharmacy department found itself heavily understaffed.
It was missing nearly 30% of the necessary staff, making this financial year "very difficult", according to the head of the department, Gillian Beaudet.
However, the CSSS has decided not to hire an independent workforce, which can cost up to three times as much as a full-time employed pharmacist.
We did not resort to troubleshooting, explained Ms. Beaudet.
Some of our activities inside the facility have been streamlined or scaled down to a level, while things get better.
Of course, we worked hard to interest our young [pharmacy residents] to come and stay here.
There was a combination of circumstances that made us in a bad situation last year.
Improved situation
After this difficult period, the year 2013-2014 promises to be much easier for the department of pharmacy of the CSSS.
Already, three female pharmacists have returned to work after their maternity leave and three other female pharmacists have been hired in recent months.
In addition, the efforts made by the department to retain students have paid off, as the four students currently in residence in Laval have also decided to remain employed by the CSSS.
Now it’s much better, the pharmacist pointed out.
By the end of the fiscal year, we will have seven new pharmacists and three maternity returns.
This will fill our departures from last year.
Always growing needs
However, the situation remains delicate.
Several factors, such as the shortage of pharmacists in hospitals or a predominance of young women in the profession, make situations such as the one experienced in 2012 difficult to predict.
For us [the number of staff] is always precarious, because we have an environment that is young and we employ a lot of young women, so with pregnancies, we almost always drive to three maternity leave when it goes well, she added.
Last year, we had a lot more and we didn't have pharmacists available to do replacements, so it was more difficult.
The 22-year-old model doesn’t start her career in the cinema through the small door.
Director Lars von Trier chose her to play young Charlotte Gainsbourg in Nymphomaniac, her next film.
This pornographic drama unfolds, in eight chapters that will be released in two parts (January 1 and 8, 2014), the erotic memories of a forty-year-old addicted to sex since his adolescence.
Stacy Martin’s resemblance to her elder is striking: a twig silhouette, a diaphanous complexion and Franco-English origins.
Not to mention a certain taste for risk: the one who had not hesitated to pose naked on glossy paper will appear in much more sulfurous situations on the big screen.
An excerpt from Nymphomaniac raised the temperature on the Web: Stacy Martin appears in bed and in full ecstasy with Shia LaBeouf.
If the provocative filmmaker asked his actors to put their modesty in the closet, he resorted to professionals of the X for the most daring sex scenes, before merging all the bodies digitally: above the belt, it is the star; below, the lining.
From Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rk to Charlotte Gainsbourg to Nicole Kidman, Lars von Trier is in the habit of pushing his actresses in their last entrenchments, always for the best.
Stacy Martin isn't done talking about her.
A room of the CGR of Narbonne evacuated Thursday evening
Thursday evening, the first session of a film was interrupted at the Mega CGR of Narbonne, as a precautionary measure, following tingling in the throat felt by the spectators.
Immediately, the director of the establishment had the room evacuated and warned the firefighters for a suspicious smell.
About 70 people walked out of the meeting.
The people were examined and full recognition of the room gave nothing.
Bad joke on a tear-jerking background?
Or an involuntary incident?
Still, the management of the cinema has played the precautionary principle and the safety of its customers thoroughly.
The room was aired and everything came back in order.
The cinema was able to regain its rights and customers regain the pleasure of images.
On screen only.
She's trying to import two kilograms of cocaine into pumpkins.
Taking advantage of Halloween, a woman tried to smuggle two kilos of cocaine hidden in pumpkins into the country on Thursday morning at Montréal-Trudeau airport.
It was during the examination of the passenger's luggage that the drug could be detected.
The cocaine had been distributed in three pumpkins that had been previously emptied.
The drug was then transported to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) office, which took over the investigation.
The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) did not disclose where the woman came from when she was intercepted.
That's part of the investigation," said CBSA spokesman Jacqueline Roby.
What I can tell you is that she was coming to the country.
Since the beginning of 2013, border services officers at Montréal-Trudeau Airport have made 173 drug seizures, including 10 cocaine seizures for a total of 44 kilograms.
In 2012, border services officers in the Quebec region made a total of 1,653 drug seizures.
Airstrikes against military installations in Syria
According to the Lebanese army, Israeli aircraft entered Lebanese airspace early in the afternoon, but the strikes took place in the evening.
A cargo of SA-8 short-range surface-to-air missiles was reportedly targeted and destroyed.
This new raid by the IDF aviation into Syrian territory (the sixth since the beginning of the year, according to the Israeli daily Haaretz) has not been confirmed by Israel or Syria.
The raid took place under circumstances almost identical to the one that took place on July 5: at the time, it was also an anonymous American official who had confirmed to CNN an Israeli attack, this time targeting Yakhont surface-to-sea missiles, delivered by Russia to Damascus.
Israeli officials had not hidden their irritation at Washington revealing the attack, at the risk of forcing President Assad to react.
Ukraine is Approaching Bankruptcy
The credit rating agency Standard & Poor's on Friday lowered Ukraine's credit rating, casting doubt on the ability of the former Soviet republic, in recession for more than a year, to meet its financial obligations.
The rating of the country's public debt securities moves to "B-", sinking into the category of speculative investments.
It comes with a negative outlook, with S&P seeing at least a one-in-three chance of it being lowered again within a year.
“It is increasingly unlikely that the government’s strategy will secure enough foreign currency to meet its high external financing needs,” the agency said.
The agency notes that Ukraine’s foreign exchange reserves fell by 26% between September 2012 and September 2013 and predicts that the trend will continue.
This complicates the repayment of credits taken abroad.
These reserves, which the authorities use massively to support the local currency, the hryvnia, collapsing, the agency judges increasingly likely a devaluation, which would inflate its external debt.
Kiev also needs cash to pay for its gas imports to Russia, which accuses it of failing to pay an $882 million bill.
The announcement is bad news for the Ukrainian government at a time of high tensions with its Russian neighbor, furious at Kiev's willingness to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November.
It was made public the day after the publication of official statistics showing that the country's economy had suffered its fifth consecutive quarter of contraction between July and September.
Its debt, still relatively modest, has exploded in recent years and S&P estimates it at 33.5% of GDP, compared to less than 10% before the 2008-2009 crisis.
The country, in budget deficit, has been asking for months for assistance from the International Monetary Fund, which had granted it a loan of 15.3 billion dollars in 2010 and has so far released only 3.4 billion.
But the Fund refuses to pay any new tranches until the country adopts unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit, including by increasing gas prices to the population.
After a new unsuccessful mission to the country, the IMF noted this week that "the significant needs for external financing" were "a vulnerability", while noting "signs of economic improvement".
However, for the economist Oleksandr Joloud of the Centre for Political Studies, "an improvement cannot be expected in the short term".
"There is little hope that unpopular reforms will be launched in a pre-election year," the expert told AFP.
The only hope is an improvement in the international situation.
S&P also notes the "uncertainty" linked to the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, which Brussels conditions the release of the opponent Yulia Tymoshenko.
“Signing the agreement would be positive for trade in the long term but there could be negative short- and medium-term consequences related to Russia’s reaction,” said S&P, which fears “trade restrictions” from Moscow.
Russia, which accounts for a quarter of Ukrainian exports, has warned that if a free trade zone is created between the EU and Kiev, it should tighten its border controls on imported goods.
U.S. green light for merger Publicis-Omnicom
Publicis and Omnicom said on Friday they had received no objection from U.S. authorities to their merger, moving closer to the creation of the world's first advertising agency.
The merger brings together Omnicom, the world’s second largest agency, and Publicis, the third largest.
“Omnicom Group and Publicis Groupe today announced the expiry of the previously announced merger review period of Publicis Groupe and Omnicom, as provided for by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended,” the two groups said in a statement.
They also received the necessary approvals in Canada, India and Turkey, after South Africa and South Korea.
The expiry of the examination period provided for by the HSR in the United States and the authorization decisions issued in the other jurisdictions satisfy several of the conditions necessary for the completion of the transaction.
“The merger is also conditional on obtaining further regulatory approvals and approval from shareholders of both groups.”
Congolese army hunts down M23 rebels
The Congolese army (FARDC) announced on Thursday that its units would chase the M23 rebels to their bases in the forests and mountains of North Kivu bordering Rwanda and Uganda.
The M23 appears on the verge of being defeated after being driven out of the northeastern localities of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) that it had controlled since the beginning, 20 months ago, of the insurgency.
"We will pursue the M23 and round it up wherever it hides because they are criminals," Colonel Olivier Hamuli, a spokesman for the FARDC, told Reuters.
We must not let them reorganize themselves because they have been martyring the Congolese people for too long.
The time has come to restore peace.
M23 officials said they had evacuated the villages under diplomatic pressure and Bertrand Bissimwa, the rebel’s political leader, said on RFI that the military setbacks would not change his demands at the peace talks.
The latter, according to Ugandan mediators, resumed Wednesday in Kampala between the government of Kinshasa and the M23.
Clashes are reported in the hills overlooking Bunagana, the last insurgent-held town to fall this week, as well as around Runyoni, a hill where the M23 rebellion erupted in 2012.
At their peak in November, the insurgents occupied Goma, the capital of North Kivu province, taking advantage of the flight of the government garrison and the passivity of the MONUSCO peacekeepers.
The fall of Goma led the United Nations Mission in the DRC, the largest in the world in terms of personnel, to strengthen its mandate and to form a rapid intervention brigade composed of South African, Malawian and Tanzanian soldiers.
For its part, the FARDC staff was reshuffled and the army went on the offensive against the M23, changing the course of the war.
The rate of growth of government troops is unprecedented.
“The M23 seems to be coming to an end,” Congolese affairs expert Jason Stearns wrote on his blog Congo Siasa.
It would be historic – it would be the first time that the Kinshasa government has managed to defeat a major insurgency.
And it would also be the first time since 1996 that no armed group allied with Rwanda would be present in eastern DRC.
United Nations experts accuse Rwanda, which denies it, of militarily supporting the M23, originally formed by former mutinied Congolese soldiers.
British Foreign Secretary William Hague has urged Rwandan President Paul Kagame to show restraint, a Foreign Office spokesman said.
Last week, Kigali raised the possibility of military retaliation for shells that fell on Rwandan territory.
On Wednesday, the inhabitants of Bunagana invaded the streets of the village to greet the entrance of the FARDC soldiers.
“We lived with the M23 for a year and it seemed unimaginable to us that we would one day be liberated by the army,” said one resident of the Ugandan border town.
“We have lived in terror (of the M23), we are traumatized,” the man added.
The tests carried out by the Institut Pasteur on a patient suspected of being infected with the coronavirus turned out to be negative, the health ministry said.
The two cases identified in May 2013 remain the only two confirmed cases in France to date.
On Tuesday, the 43-year-old patient was suspected of having reached, after returning from Saudi Arabia, a country where the disease has already caused about fifty deaths.
Chevron, the No. 2 U.S. oil company, on Friday reported a decline in quarterly profit due to lower refining margins, as its oil and gas output rose while falling short of the group's targets.
Net income for the third quarter decreased to $4.95 billion, or $2.57 per share, from $5.25 billion, or $2.69 per share, a year earlier.
Analysts polled by Reuters averaged earnings per share of $2.71.
The group produced 2.59 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in the quarter, up from 2.52 million bpd a year earlier.
The company is targeting 2.65 million bpd for this year, with 25% production growth expected by 2017.
Most of the growth in the coming years will come from its liquefied natural gas projects in Australia.
As a result of the cost of these projects, annual capital expenditures have increased by $7 billion in two years and are expected to reach $36.7 billion in 2013.
Profits from production activities decreased slightly in the third quarter, while profits from downstream activities (including refining and chemical production) fell 45% to $380 million.
This decline in refining margins affects the entire sector.
Chevron's main competitor, Exxon Mobil, reported lower net profit on Thursday, despite rising oil and gas production.
Schoolboy transport: the complaint deemed admissible
The Commission scolaire de la Région-de-Sherbrooke (CSRS) has since the beginning of the school year charged a fee of $150 per student (up to a maximum of $300 per family) for students receiving school transportation to two residences, a service that the organization provides when it is able to do so.
Prior to the changes to the last budget, no financial contribution was claimed.
"There is a mediation service that is proposed by the commission and I was interested," explains Ms. Lef<0xC3><0xA8>vre.
According to her, CSRS was invited to mediation and asked for additional time to think about it.
"It's always better to talk about it, to consult and find solutions," says Ms. Lef<0xC3><0xA8>vre.
The Commission scolaire de la Région-de-Sherbrooke (CSRS) declined to comment.
The organization has only meant that mediation is part of the complaint process.
Imbroglio around the closure of the emergencies of the Hotel-Dieu
Faced with the slingshot carried out for several months by some of the staff and several unions, including the CGT, the Minister of Health, Marisol Touraine, had decided on July 10 to "shift the implementation schedule of the project, and in particular the date of closure of the emergencies that can not intervene on November 4 ".
A request officially made "to run no risk on the management of emergencies in Paris at the beginning of the winter" but which also aimed not to hinder the campaign of the PS a few months from the municipal.
Despite ministerial instructions, the closure should still be effective on that date.
Even if, at APHP, the term "transformation" or "change in continuity" is preferred.
As of November 4, firefighters who provided about a quarter of the 40,000 annual visits to the emergency rooms of the H<0xC3><0xB4>tel-Dieu will all have received instructions to take the thirty or so serious cases a day to the emergency rooms of other Parisian hospitals.
This date of November 4 also corresponds to the renewal of boarding schools.
At the H<0xC3><0xB4>tel-Dieu, the interns specialized in emergencies will give way Monday to five interns of general medicine.
As for the transfer of the beds of internal medicine, it is scheduled for the course of the month.
"The emergency reception service of the H<0xC3><0xB4>tel-Dieu must close as soon as possible, and for us, it's November 4," says Lo<0xC3><0xAF>c Capron, the president of the medical establishment commission (CME) of the APHP, which supports the project of the management.
"On November 4, there will be no more patients brought by firefighters, only people coming by their own means," confirms Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical manager of the new H<0xC3><0xB4>tel-Dieu.
"But we will continue to receive patients in emergency," he said, arguing the permanent presence of vehicles of the SMUR on site to transfer serious cases.
Senior emergency physicians will remain on site, he said.
But it is up to the ARS to decide whether to close the emergency service.
"Things are being done gradually," says Nicolas Péju, spokesman for the ARS for which, on November 4, "there will be no change in terms of service rendered."
"The minister lied to us or was lied to," said emergency doctor Gerald Kierzek.
Removed from his post as head of the SMUR at the beginning of July for having led the slingshot against the reorganization project, he defines himself as a "warning launcher" in the face of a "cynical" decision taken by "the medical-administrative technostructure".
“They are emptying and suffocating emergencies that were renovated less than five years ago,” he said.
"If the other Parisian emergency services could absorb the surplus, there would be no problem."
They are regularly engorged.
For example, there are sometimes nine hours of waiting at the emergency room in Lariboisi<0xC3><0xA8>re.
At the ARS, it is argued that thirty patients "dispatched" to several sites are not likely to represent an "avalanche" in the other emergency services, whose human resources have also been strengthened.
At the ARS as at the APHP, we defend the "new hospital model" already launched since October 7 and which should continue to welcome 30,000 to 35,000 patients per year.
By the end of the year, liberal general practitioners are also expected to participate in the establishment of an "ambulatory care permanence".
"Where are we going if we ask people to self-diagnose," wonders Gérald Kierzek for whom "the concept of emergency not serious" is "dangerous" and marks a "medical regression".
It's going to be like level 3 maternity wards.
People are not crazy, they will go where there is the best offer of care.
If the minister does not take action by Monday, we will change gear, warns Christophe Prudhomme, emergency physician and member of the CGT Health.
We will be even more present as part of the municipal campaign and we will think about presenting a list.
In the team of Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, Vincent Roger, UMP advisor of Paris and elected of the 4th arrondissement, clearly announces that "even if the Parisian UMP were for the maintenance of the emergencies at the H<0xC3><0xB4>tel-Dieu, it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them if we return to responsibilities".
Anne Hidalgo, the PS candidate, reminded again Monday morning on France Inter that she had voted in favor of a moratorium so that there is no closure on November 4.
If this were the case, it would mark his clear disagreement, points out Bruno Julliard, his spokesman.
Even if the restructuring of the H<0xC3><0xB4>tel-Dieu has its legitimacy on the merits, we cannot admit it without an acceptable scheme of deferral to other hospitals.
Obama ends wiretapping of IMF and World Bank
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama has ordered the National Security Agency to end its wiretapping of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as part of its intelligence activities, a U.S. official said on Thursday.
The move is part of the White House’s attempt to regain control of the NSA wiretapping case after revelations made by former analyst Edward Snowden, a refugee in Russia.
This is the first time the surveillance of the IMF and World Bank has been mentioned by the intelligence agency since the scandal began.
When asked about the matter, a US administration official replied: “The US does not conduct electronic surveillance of World Bank and IMF headquarters in Washington.”
Speaking on condition of anonymity, the official did not say whether such surveillance had been carried out in the past.
Another official said Barack Obama had given orders to stop the practice in recent weeks.
This instruction was given at about the same time as the one ending the wiretapping of the UN headquarters in New York.
In this context, the Senate Intelligence Committee approved on Thursday a strengthening of controls on government surveillance programs but authorized their continuation.
The commission introduced new restrictions on the data that intelligence agencies are allowed to collect and imposed a five-year limit on the retention of that information.
UN welcomes new goals for poverty alleviation
The United Nations will now begin work on a new set of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were established 12 years ago to combat global poverty.
Australian diplomats have played a key role in putting forward the “sustainable development goals” to replace the MDGs, which will expire in 2015, ahead of the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit that began the day before in Rio de Janeiro.
They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on the eve of the summit that it was now time to “overtake national interests”.
“I am pleased that Member States have agreed to launch and take ownership of the process to set universal sustainable development goals (SDGs),” he added.
These SDGs will build on the progress made towards the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will do my utmost to fulfil the mandate given to me by Member States to achieve our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals that build on the success of the MDGs.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing as conflicts erupt between powerful figures
At the foot of the statue of Samora Machel, Mozambique’s founding president, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo to chant peaceful slogans during a rare public demonstration.
“We want peace back; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, chief executive of an investment firm.
Worried about the future of her country, she exchanged her work clothes for a T-shirt with the words "we want security" in Portuguese before joining the crowd gathered in the capital's Independence Square on Thursday.
For two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of conflict between government forces and Renamo, the worst clashes since the peace agreement was signed more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, initially supported by white-ruled Rhodesia and later the apartheid government of South Africa as part of efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After a peace agreement was signed in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe the country should not fall back into open conflict, but recent events have shaken foreign investors and the local population.
The stakes are high for the growing economy as the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the northwest could attract more than $50 billion in investment over the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the United States.
Frelimo, the ruling party and the main political force since 1975, and Renamo mutually reject responsibility for tensions.
Renamo says the government is behind the recent clashes and launched an attack on its members in Sofala province, a traditional stronghold of Renamo, on October 17.
The assaults on the former rebels then escalated when government forces attacked Renamo’s bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group’s leader, and Fernando Mazanga, Renamo’s spokesman, according to the Financial Times.
The government holds Renamo responsible for sparking the conflict, and accuses it of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has sought to minimize concerns about instability.
Mr Guebuza told AFP on Wednesday that Mr Dhlakama considered himself a "loser" who wanted to use "all the forces he had left to try to prove that he could impose his decisions on the government".
Frelimo and Renamo insist that they both wish to avoid war.
But concern grew after Mazanga said Renamo was abandoning the 1992 peace deal.
He told the FT that he wanted to say that the deal was no longer respected by Frelimo.
“We want to resume negotiations, but with the utmost seriousness,” Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the parties have failed to defuse tensions fueled by a series of conflicts this year.
“These are two great men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who keep arguing,” said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and a specialist on Mozambique.
None of them knows how to negotiate well and none of them is ready to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, which is in favor of electoral reforms, had already said it would boycott municipal elections due to take place in November.
Presidential and legislative elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted his use of force as an attempt by an ailing movement to obtain concessions and a war chest from the government.
Renamo's share of the vote has been declining since 1992, while a new party, the Mozambique Democratic Movement (MDM), which was created by a former Renamo member, is expected to win more votes in elections.
Mazanga said Guebuza – who is due to retire at the end of his second term next year – wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
“He doesn’t want a multiparty democracy, he doesn’t want transparent elections, he doesn’t want peace because he doesn’t want to leave the presidency,” Mazanga said.
It is not known exactly what capacity the Renamo has, but it has carried out disruptive flash attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south motorway axis.
Most of the clashes took place in Sofala province, which is located several hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but where Beira is located, the port from which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, export coal.
In June, Rio was no longer able to use the railway for about a week after the Renamo threatened to attack the railway line.
Mr. Mazanga was falsely shy when asked if Renamo would reiterate this threat.
Renamo wanted to “warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique,” Mazanga said.
Instability has heightened frustrations with the government, says Fernando Lima, director of Mediacoop, an independent media company, with many also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent wave of kidnappings.
“People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country, and it’s up to the president to find solutions to the problems,” he said.
Omar Sultane, a protester, said people only wanted stability.
“Nobody cares about the Renamo or the Frelimo, they just want to find peace, they want to have free access to the roads,” he added.
Myths and legends should be taught to children as “lifestyle models,” says the author.
The Legend of Thor could show that “brutal force does not weigh against subtle cunning,” while Arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Saying that many myths would be “far too violent, far too outrageous and in some cases, far too obscene to be taught in school,” Crossley-Holland advocated a “careful selection” of age-appropriate works.
“I think it’s great that in America, myths and folklore are already part of education,” he said.
I have been advocating for this project for 20 years.
He added that the fact that authors and teachers are “openly didactic” means that children “drop out completely”, with messages being “sublimated” into pleasant stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and wrote The Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said: “You may have good intentions, but you prefer to keep them out of sight.”
Perhaps the big difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to offer hope.
Not that everything has to be simplified or end well, but there is an innate sense of right and wrong.
And it must be sublimated; revealed through a story rather than declared.
The known basis of what is shown and what is not said.
A fighter from Hamas’ military wing was killed tonight and another wounded by Israeli tank fire in the Gaza Strip, medical and security sources in Gaza said.
According to these sources, these activists were conducting a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian territory and Israel when they were shot at by an Israeli armoured vehicle.
NSA spying: U.S. ‘goes too far,’ Kerry admits
The United States has sometimes gone “too far” in terms of espionage, admitted Secretary of State John Kerry, in Washington’s first admission in full controversy with Europe on the massive collection of data by the National Security Agency (NSA).
After ten days of scandal, revelations and denials between the United States and its European allies, this is the first time a U.S. government official has explicitly admitted controversial practices in the NSA’s interception of communications and data in Europe.
“In some cases, I concede to you, as the president has done, some of these actions have gone too far and we’re going to make sure that doesn’t happen in the future,” Kerry told a conference in London he was attending from Washington via video link on Thursday.
In his retransmitted speech, in the presence of his British counterpart William Hague, the head of US diplomacy has long justified the practices of intelligence and information collection by the necessary fight against terrorism and the prevention of possible attacks.
Invoking the attacks of September 11, 2001, the Madrid attacks of March 2004 and those of London in July 2005, John Kerry assured that the US authorities had since thwarted many projects of attacks, thanks to the interception of communications and the collection of information.
“We actually prevented planes from falling, buildings from exploding and people from being murdered because we were able to be aware of these projects up front,” he said.
And, John Kerry said to the Europeans, "I assure you that in this process innocent people have not been deceived."
But we strive to gather information.
"And yes, in some cases, it went too far in an inappropriate way," said the secretary of state, who had already had to speak about the international scandal during a tour last week in Paris, London and Rome.
He said Thursday night that President Obama was "resolute to try to clarify and to review these practices so that no one feels cheated."
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans continued to swell this week with new revelations in the press.
According to the Washington Post, the NSA was intercepting data from hundreds of millions of Google and Yahoo users.
The newspaper, which cites documents obtained from former NSA consultant Edward Snowden, says the program dubbed “MUSCULAR,” and conducted with the NSA’s British counterpart, GCHQ, allows these two agencies to retrieve data from the optical fibers used by internet giants.
According to one of the documents, some 181 million items had been collected in the month of January alone - ranging from metadata on emails, to text items or audio or video documents.
These interceptions would take place outside the United States.
But Yahoo and Google have denied any connection to these practices.
For the past ten days, several major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain and Italy have revealed that the NSA has massively intercepted data and communications from allies of the United States and their leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Faced with the anger of European states and while leaks in the American press claimed that the American president was not aware of such eavesdropping, Barack Obama refused to speak about it, invoking national security.
On the other hand, the boss of the powerful NSA, General Keith Alexander, denied to him that his intelligence agency has captured tens of millions of communications from European citizens.
He even returned the bullet to the European intelligence services that would have seized these communications, before providing them to the NSA.
This would involve "military operations" in countries where these NATO allies are cooperating with the United States, and it would not be aimed at Europe at all, General Alexander said.
And the controversy spread Friday to Asia.
Indonesia has summoned the ambassador of Australia, whose mission is accused of being used by the Americans as part of a vast international espionage network that has also aroused China's ire.
Paris Saint-Germain will host Lorient on Friday without its master asset, Swede Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is injured, the Ligue 1 club said in a statement.
PSG, leader of the league ahead of Monaco in the difference of goals, broadcast the list of players selected for this match of the 12th day, without the 32-year-old forward.
The statement simply said he was "wounded" without specifying the nature of the injury.
However, he suffered from inflammation of the left knee when he returned from selection at the beginning of the month.
A ceremony in memory of the cremated dead
The P<0xC3><0xA8>re Lachaise crematorium organizes, at 11 am, a secular ceremony, in memory of all the deceased crematized in its establishment, during the year.
Anne Hidalgo, socialist candidate for the mayor of Paris must attend, and will then explain, at a press conference, his proposals in terms of funeral.
To follow the ceremony, click above.
For their own funerals, more and more French people choose cremation, rather than burial: 53%, according to an Ipsos study carried out on September 6 and 7 among 1009 people, instead of 47%.
For the funeral of a loved one, it is the opposite: the French prefer burial (53% against 47%).
If they have the misfortune to lose a child, they are only 15% to choose cremation.
In his book The Death in Ashes, Damien Le Guay, philosopher and vice-president of the National Committee on Funeral Ethics, insists on the "violence" that cremation constitutes, for the survivors.
There is, with the cremation, "a violence done to the beloved body", which will be "reduced to a pile of ashes" in a very short time, and not after a process of decomposition, which "would accompany the phases of mourning".
There is also "a symbolic violence", which is due to the "effacement of the singularity and distinctive signs" reduced to the "anonymity" of the ashes.
Why is what is accepted without difficulty in some Nordic and Protestant countries still poorly experienced in France?
"Because cremation is a new fact," says Marie-Frédérique Bacqué, president of the Society of Thanatology and author of the book Taming Death.
It has only been tolerated since 1963 by the Catholic Church, which has limited attempts to tame it.
To tame cremation is for Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Michaud-Nérard, director general of the Funeral Services of the City of Paris, to provide for the deceased a ceremony as dignified as the one to which he would be entitled with a burial.
The annual Ipsos survey shows a very strong attachment to the organization of the ceremony.
77% of French people want one, for their relatives, whether it is religious (53%), or civil (24%).
Today, 73% of people who have chosen cremation want to organize a ceremony.
66% of atheists and non-believers also desire it.
The crematoriums have adapted to this evolution of society.
"For the last ten years, they have been trying to avoid the violence of waiting, without doing anything, for an hour and a half, immediately followed by the release of the ashes," observes Michaud-Nérard.
70% of establishments now offer masters of ceremonies, who proceed, in the presence of the body, to the following ritual: welcome the assembly, appoint the deceased, connect him to others, evoke him, give meaning to his death, organize the farewell.
This has been the case at the P<0xC3><0xA8>re Lachaise crematorium since 1998.
The masters of ceremony are often people who have been converted.
There are also former Catholic priests.
It is in this context that the P<0xC3><0xA8>re Lachaise crematorium has organized, since 2010, on the day of La Toussaint, several ceremonies of remembrance, secular and non-religious, to which it invites the families of people who have been crematized in the year.
For the second consecutive year, one of these ceremonies is broadcast online, to the attention of those who could not make the trip.
The crematorium allowed us to relay it.
In La Seyne, the rehousing for rats turns to controversy
At the beginning of the week, a family left their apartment on the ground floor of the Fructidor D2 building, due to the presence of rats.
Faced with the urgency of the situation, the director of the office Terres du Sud Habitat, proposed, exceptionally and provisionally, to rehouse the couple and their three children in a new T4.
However, the family refuses "for financial reasons" and the situation is blocked.
The case has taken exaggerated proportions, says Joel Canapa, the director of the office.
There have always been rats in cities.
The deratization company carries out two passages a year, and in addition, we intervene, at our expense, at each request of the inhabitants.
Since the end of last winter, we have made 64 interventions.
The neighborhood is not abandoned, and rats do not swarm in the city.
For reasons of environmental protection and public health, deratization products are four times less effective than in the past, of course, but for two rats, we are not going to kill a child.
“We didn’t invite the rats into our home,” said the father, who left his home to move into the hotel.
We are soon penniless and we are waiting for a new home, at the same rate as the old one.
Tokyo Stock Exchange ends down 0.88%, News
The Tokyo Stock Exchange ended lower on Friday despite good Chinese manufacturing statistics.
The rating has suffered from the decline of the dollar against the yen, harmful to export values and the warning on its annual result launched by Sony on Thursday.
The Nikkei lost 126.37 points (0.88%) to 14,201.57 and the Topix lost 11.23 points (0.94%) to 1,183.03.
Sony fell more than 11 percent to 1,668 yen.
A house in flames in Old Quebec
A fire that started at noon on Friday in Old Quebec was quickly brought under control.
More than thirty firefighters were dispatched to 9 rue Hébert.
The flames broke out in a house of three dwellings spread over four floors located behind the courtyard of the Séminaire de Québec.
All the tenants were absent during the fire.
The fire was brought under control an hour after the arrival of the firefighters, many of whom intervened.
As soon as our first firefighters arrived, they really saw apparent smoke.
"So the alarms were repeated, because it took reinforcement to attack the building, because it is buildings stuck here," explained France Loiselle, spokesman for the Quebec City firefighters.
An investigation is underway to find the cause of the fire.
Ben Greenman: Tenth Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
One could say that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up in America: almost 100 years ago, vaudeville actor Frank Fay, who played the master of ceremonies at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began telling jokes directly in front of the audience, in the tone of conversation.
Fay's innovation continued over the years, until it was picked up more recently by the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and supervised by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the stand-up club Carolines, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 shows presented in small clubs and large theaters.
“Most of the headliners emerged in the Carolinas, and were hugely successful, until they became too famous to play at a club,” Hirsch said.
We created this festival in order to be able to continue working with them.
This year’s event will feature Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of “Stand Up for Heroes,” a night of comedy and music for veterans at Madison Square Garden, featuring, among others, Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
The festival has grown, as has the world of comedy.
Several of the actors participating in this year’s festival have gone through non-traditional circuits, for example by presenting shows on small television channels, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll appeared on the front of the stage in a sitcom on a cable channel (“The League” on the theme of the fantasy football joyfully lascivious of the channel FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate participated in the show "Saturday Night Live" and was part of the cast of the series "Parks and Recreation", but she is best known for her series of viral videos "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Kroll and Slate, as well as other young actors with singular voices (surrealist pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, ironic racial justice advocate W. Kamau Bell), are pure products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the main attraction factors of the festival this year will be an interview: David Steinberg chatting with Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but he became an accomplished film and television director, as well as an unofficial historian of comedy.
Between 2005 and 2007, he hosted a show on TV Land called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg".
The rendezvous takes place at City Hall in downtown Manhattan.
“The city is definitely in the comical DNA of all of Larry’s work,” Steinberg said.
He used to tell me that when he was here, sometimes he'd walk down an alleyway between two buildings and say, "Well, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll come and live here."
The price of oil continues to fall and approaches $ 96 per barrel
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday as concerns over the size of inventories offset a report showing China's electricity-hungry manufacturing sector is strengthening.
The price of U.S. benchmark crude for delivery in December fell 14 cents to $96.24 a barrel in late-morning Europe during electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
The contract lost 39 cents on Thursday, leaving it down 5.8% for the month of October.
The abundant supply of crude oil has weighed on the price in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said on Wednesday that U.S. supplies had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, supplies increased by more than 25 million barrels.
But two reports on the Chinese manufacturing sector on Friday, which show activity growth, suggest a rise in demand.
This suggests that China’s economic recovery could continue to strengthen after growth rebounded to 7.8% in the third quarter, after a decline that had not been seen for two decades in the previous quarter.
Brent crude, a benchmark for international crude already used by U.S. refineries, lost 26 cents to fall to $108.58 a barrel on the Inter-Continental Exchange (ICE) in London.
Challenging the Right to Abortion in Texas
A federal appeals court in Texas has reinstated some restrictions on the right to voluntary termination of pregnancy that had been blocked by a trial judge this week.
This judgment means that a law adopted in July in this state and widely questioning the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.
The Court of Appeal’s ruling means that doctors who perform abortions will have to have “admission privilege” with local hospitals.
Admission privilege is the right of a physician, by virtue of his or her status as a caring member of a hospital, to admit a patient to a hospital or medical centre for the purpose of making a diagnosis or treatment.
Advocates of abortion argue that the content of the law could result in an immediate closure of one-third of the state’s clinics because those clinics have failed to obtain this “admission privilege” for their practitioners.
In total, almost 22,000 women would be deprived of access to these institutions.
On Monday, a trial judge ruled on the eve of the law's entry into force that the provisions dealing with admission privilege were unconstitutional.
But Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, a Republican who is running for governor, has asked the appeals court to overturn the first-instance judgment that blocked the law’s enforcement.
A plenary hearing on this issue is scheduled for January.
The New Star made a strong comeback on the ratings side, with 1.3 million viewers behind their TV set, or 5.6% audience share.
But was the show at the rendezvous?
Some 10,000 candidates showed up for the auditions of this 10th season, to face the jury: Maurane, the evil Sinclair, the perched André Manoukian and Olivier Bas.
On Twitter, viewers shared their comments.
After the excitement of finding their favorite program, many were disappointed.
But why so much disappointment?
No candidate seems to have really scored in this first prize.
As every year, the first audition shows feature a wide selection of aspiring singers, for better and sometimes for worse.
However, on Twitter, we want spectacle, emotion, originality, music...
Fortunately, a few have found their way.
Many of them tried the New Star, and sometimes even went all the way.
Behind the television screens, the vocations of successful singer are still there, season after season.
Others just have the ambition to make you laugh.
The court blocks a decision on the NYPD’s control and search policy
A federal appeals court on Thursday blocked a judge’s decision demanding changes to the New York Police Department’s screening and search program and removed her from the case.
The U.S. Court of Appeals (Second Circuit) has indicated that Judge Shira Scheindlin's decision is suspended until the city's appeal is finalized.
The judge ruled in August that the city had violated the constitution following the implementation of its program to control and interrogate citizens.
The city appealed its findings and corrective orders, including a decision to assign a controller to assist the police department in changing its policy and associated training program.
The appeals court heard arguments Tuesday on the suspension request.
The appeals court said the judge should be removed from the case because she violated the judges' code of conduct by compromising the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of bias, in part because of a series of media interviews and public statements in which she publicly reacted to the court's criticism.
The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by falsely targeting black and Hispanic men as part of their screening and search program.
It has appointed an external controller to oversee changes, including policy reform, training and oversight, and has ordered a pilot program to test body-worn cameras in neighborhoods with the highest number of controls.
In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of keeping the names and addresses of people whose cases are dismissed after a police check.
The hearing of the City's appeal is expected to take place after March 14, 2014.
The tactic of control and search has been criticized by many civil rights advocates.
This control and search system has existed for decades in some form, but the number of controls recorded has increased dramatically under the administration of independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg, to reach its all-time high in 2011 with 684,330 controls involving mostly black and Hispanic men.
A legal action was brought in 2004 by four men, all from minorities, and turned into a class action.
Proponents of changes to the NYPD’s vetting and search program say they will end unfair practices, build more effective and trusted police forces, and change the way police departments use politics.
Opponents say these changes would undermine police morale without bringing down crime, represent a waste of money, and would not solve the broader problem of police forces under pressure after police numbers were sharply reduced over the past decade.
The judge pointed out that she was not ending the constitutional screening and search practices, but reforming the way the NYPD implemented its screenings.
Tenants must vote, because each of them pays an average of $100 per month on the price of housing that goes in taxes to the City.
When the landlord pays $5,000 in municipal taxes, he divides that amount between each dwelling.
We are forced to increase rents to help us pay the new taxes.
When we go to vote, we send a clear message.
We need to change things for the city.
All the candidates told us they would tackle the scandalous debt.
We can't afford $100,000 worth of fireworks, $4 million to $5 million worth of land just in case...
Go vote, that's the best way to express yourself and say that's enough.
End of service for the chef of the Elysée
Entering the 500 m2 of the Elysian kitchens as a clerk after working in embassies, the cook climbed all the echelons until becoming a chef, nine years ago.
He served six French presidents, from Georges Pompidou to Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande to Nicolas Sarkozy, including on their vacations, and fed countless numbers of the world's greats in a quasi-anonymity that he only breaks today, at the time of retirement, at 60 years old.
The man with an open face, bald skull and intellectual glasses, born on October 24, 1953 at La Ferté-Saint-Aubin holds a pastry CAP.
Her mother was herself a cook in a castle in Sologne.
“I went from one castle to another!” said Bernard Vaussion, who knows not only the habits of the six presidents for whom he officiated, but also of their wives and some of their illustrious guests.
"It is always the head of state or his partner or wife who chooses the menus," he recalls.
"Ms. Chirac was a little more involved, she came directly to the kitchen", to the point that she had banned women in the kitchens of the Elysée!
Do not displease heads of state who showed a relative indifference to earthly foods, "they are all greedy," gently denounces Bernard Vaussion.
Jacques Chirac certainly had "a slightly more developed appetite".
But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who had removed the cheese, the plates came back empty!
As for Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande, who reinstated cheese, “it’s someone who likes to eat” and “there’s not much he doesn’t like”.
The current head of state, who regained the kilos lost before the presidential campaign, has "no request for a specific regime".
Bernard Vaussion also remembers the pressure that weighed on his shoulders, especially during the state dinners at the Elysée: you have to serve "between 200 and 250 people in about an hour".
The night before is almost white.
These people would not understand that there are mistakes.
The now former chef of the kitchens of the Elysée, who had a drink Tuesday night with his team, his family and friends, leaves with a pinch in the heart.
He said compliments.
“His human side came out,” he said.
The chef will be replaced by his deputy, Guillaume Gomez, 35, who has been at the Elysee for seventeen years.
Fire in a house built in 1850 in Quebec City
A historic house built in 1850 was the prey of flames in Old Quebec Friday noon.
The four-unit building, located at 15 rue Hébert, was the subject of three alarms with the fire department.
The fire broke out in the front, but rose over the three floors of the building.
France Voiselle, spokesman for the Quebec City Fire Protection Service, said the rapid response of firefighters has prevented the spread of flames to adjacent buildings, a major challenge for this area of the city where buildings are built in a close manner.
The burned house housed four dwellings, but no tenants were on the premises at the time of the fire.
The damage was very limited, even if the water caused damage.
An investigation will be conducted to determine its origin, but the sappers have ruled out the thesis of a criminal act.
The Wolf of Wall Street: Second Trailer Released
Martin Scorsese misses some images of his next film whose title role, that of an ambitious New York broker, is played by Leonardo DiCaprio.
Forget about being reasonable and get your tickets out.
Leonardo DiCaprio is going to decapitate you in his role as a crazy trader.
Martin Scorsese tells the true story of a Long Island stockbroker who refuses to cooperate with the authorities in a vast corruption case on Wall Street.
In the 80s, Jordan Belfort sets up a scam that will make him a rich man, very rich.
The opportunity to follow his incredible ascent, but also the dizzying fall that will follow.
Without limits, the man links parties, women, drugs.
Decadence and excess of all kinds are the watchwords of this crazy story.
The Scorsese-DiCaprio couple seems to have rediscovered the magic that had united them in Shutter Island.
The release of the new Scorsese has been delayed due to its too long assembly.
It seems that the movie lasts 2h45.
In theaters on December 25, he will be able to participate in the Oscars race.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a pipe
Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson reportedly used “telephone hacking, surveillance and confrontation” to try to confirm a phony tip about a liaison involving then-acting Home Secretary Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey court that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke was having a relationship with Hannah Pawlby, her "pretty special counsel".
It was reported to the court that the newspaper instructed Glenn Mulcaire, a private detective, to hack Pawlby’s voicemail and “permanently crash in front of his door,” but Coulson also called her and left her voicemails.
“The prosecution suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not the kind of man who stands in front of people’s homes hoping to surprise them, he’s the kind of man who likes to present the story to people to see what they say about it,” Edis said.
He said NotW was using three means to investigate the subjects: phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation.
The editor-in-chief is personally involved in the third.
It is obvious that he is aware of the second, the surveillance, it can not be otherwise.
But what about the first one?
Are you aware of phone hacking?
He says the opposite, but we say “Of course so”.
Rumors of an affair involving Clarke were first picked up by NotW's editorial board when a source, experiencing sexual attraction to Ms. Pawlby, stated that she had been told, "Don't waste your time with her, she's with Charles."
A tape recording of hacked voice messages on his phone at least three times was seized from Mulcaire's home in August 2006.
Investigators also found seizures on the private investigator's computer that concerned Ms. Pawlby and her sister stored in a "Projects" folder.
During the time the detective investigated her, Ms. Pawlby’s grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about her, Mr. Edis added.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw the monitoring of Ms. Pawlby's every move.
In a voice message he left him on June 18, 2005, Coulson said, "I have a story that we plan to publish tomorrow that I would really like to talk to Charles about."
Edis explained that Coulson's involvement in the story followed the same pattern as with other important men, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The jury heard Thursday that Coulson had confronted Mr. Blunkett about an affair with a married woman while he himself was dating co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who was also married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks denied conspiring with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted to phone hacking.
Barack Obama Meets with Iraqi Prime Minister amid Escalation of Violence
The US president was due to receive Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki on Friday, November 1, 2013, seeking help from the United States to fight the strongest wave of violence in five years.
Iraq experienced its deadliest month in five-and-a-half years in October, according to figures released Friday by Iraqi authorities.
964 people died in the violence in October, including 855 civilians, 65 police officers and 44 soldiers, and 1,600 people were injured.
The UN has an even higher toll, with 979 dead and 1,902 wounded.
The violence is increasingly deadly despite heightened security measures and large-scale military operations launched months ago by the Shiite-dominated government of Nouri Al Maliki.
The total death toll in October was the highest since April 2008, when 1,073 people were killed.
About two years after the withdrawal of U.S. troops, the level of violence is raising fears of a new conflagration as neighboring Syria is gripped by a civil war.
Bombs hit markets, mosques, weddings and funerals.
Men are shot dead in the street or even at home, and security forces are also the target of frequent attacks.
The growing discontent of the Sunni minority, in power under Saddam Hussein, who complain of being politically marginalized and being the target of unjust arrests, has facilitated this outbreak of violence.
On Friday, new violence killed four people in northern Iraq, the day after at least 26 people were killed in a series of attacks, including the explosion of five car bombs north of Baghdad.
Much of the violence has been blamed on the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), a group affiliated with Al-Qaeda (Sunni extremists), also involved in the civil war in Syria.
Nouri Al Maliki wants a “global war” against Al-Qaeda.
The violence is at the center of talks in the United States by Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki who will be received on Friday by President Barack Obama, two years after their previous meeting, on December 12, 2011.
At the time, the US president, elected on the promise to end military engagement in that country, had drawn an optimistic picture of the situation.
Since his arrival in Washington on Wednesday, Nouri Al Maliki has increased the number of meetings with the executive branch and the elected representatives of the Congress.
On Thursday, he called for the international community to wage a "third world war" against al-Qaida.
The principle of increased security assistance to Iraq is supported by influential Republican and Democratic senators.
But the latter also criticized Nouri Al Maliki, a Shiite, attributing partial responsibility for the resumption of violence by his "sectarian and authoritarian policy".
They also demanded that Barack Obama make it clear to Nouri Al Maliki that “Iran’s pernicious influence within the Iraqi government constitutes a serious problem in our bilateral relationship.”
Beijing accuses Uyghur group of Tiananmen attack
China's internal security chief on Friday accused a group of Xinjiang Uighur separatists of being behind the car bomb that killed five people in Tiananmen Square in central Beijing on Monday.
The vehicle, an SUV, pounced on the crowd in the Chinese capital’s famous plaza, a symbol of the deadly 1989 crackdown, and caught fire, killing its three passengers and two bystanders.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Bureau in charge of internal security issues, accused the Islamic movement in East Turkestan of instigating the attack.
Many Uighurs, a Turkic-speaking minority living in Xinjiang, call the province East Turkestan.
For the Chinese government, this movement is responsible for the frequent eruptions of violence that occur there animated by independence demands.
"The violent terrorist incident that occurred in Beijing was organized and premeditated," Meng told Hong Kong's Phoenix TV.
"The group behind the scenes was the Islamic movement in East Turkestan," he said, according to the China News Agency.
Chinese police identified the driver of the vehicle whose name suggests he was of Uyghur origin and said his wife and mother were with him in the car.
The latter also contained containers filled with gasoline and a flag with Orthodox religious inscriptions.
The incident left 42 people injured.
The Islamic movement in East Turkestan is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations.
Vatican Probe on Contraception, Divorce and Homosexuality
The Vatican is conducting a large worldwide survey on how parishes handle sensitive issues such as contraception, divorce and same-sex couples.
The survey asks participants how priests care for gay couples and their children, and how they treat men and women who live together without being united by the bonds of marriage.
The survey was sent in mid-October to each national bishops' conference, with instructions to get as many responses as possible.
The information will be used for an important gathering on the family that Pope Francis plans to organize next year.
The news was reported Thursday by the National Catholic Reporter, an independent U.S. Catholic newspaper.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops confirmed that the document was authentic and that each bishop would decide the appropriate way to poll parishioners.
In the UK, bishops published the poll on the internet asking Catholics to participate.
DRC: army attacks last rebel stronghold
The irreducibles of the M23, a few hundred fighters, were entrenched at nearly 2,000 meters above sea level on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and Jomba, two localities located about 80 km north of Goma, the capital of North Kivu province.
"It has not stopped since this morning, the fighting continues despite the night," said a resident of Jomba, reached by phone at about 12:30 p.m., and according to which a girl was shot in the morning.
"The intensity of the clashes has decreased a little," he added, "it seems that the FARDC Armed Forces of the DRC have repelled the rebels a little."
According to the witness who wished to remain anonymous, the soldiers had "spent the night" in Jomba before going to the front for a "sweeping operation".
There was a very clear sound behind him of crackling with small arms.
From Bunagana, the political stronghold and last stronghold of the rebellion that fell on Wednesday, an AFP journalist could hear heavy weapons detonations.
According to a source at the United Nations Mission for the Stabilization of the DRC, the fighting has entered "a final phase", with the FARDC having "surrounded the residual positions of the M23 to dislodge them".
Since the resumption on Friday of clashes between the 23 March Movement (M23) and the army, MONUSCO has not been directly involved in the fighting, but has been providing government troops with crucial intelligence, observation and planning support.
In the late afternoon, several dozen soldiers, well supplied with ammunition, were climbing towards the front line.
They were armed with Kalashnikovs and rocket launchers.
Earlier, on the road to Bunagana, a border crossing with Uganda, military personnel assisted by civilians loaded a multiple rocket launcher mounted on a brand-new FARDC truck, to replace another machine pounding M23 positions on the hills.
Congolese President Joseph Kabila on Wednesday night again called on rebels to "voluntarily demobilize" or be disarmed "by force", but left the Kampala process open, where Kinshasa and the M23 have been discussing since December with no result for now.
On the ground, M23 political leaders hope to reach an agreement.
"We have finished the talks, it remains only for the Ugandan mediation to organize the signature," said Roger Lumbala, vice-president of the M23 delegation, without this information being immediately confirmed on the government side.
The M23 was born from a mutiny in April 2012 of former rebels, mainly Tutsi, who joined the army in 2009 after a peace agreement.
The UN and Kinshasa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda of supporting M23, which Kigali and Kampala deny.
North Kivu is one of the most densely populated regions in the DRC, and its subsoil is teeming with coveted mineral resources.
In Bunagana, on the Ugandan side of the border, where about 5,000 people had taken refuge between Monday and Wednesday, according to the UN, the movement back to the DRC that had started in the morning reversed at midday.
“This morning we crossed back to go to our fields, but the military told us to retreat,” Imelda Nyirankusi, surrounded by her nine children, including an infant on her back, told AFP.
It feels like the gunfire is getting closer to the people.
In the early evening, dozens of people crossed the border, some with mattresses on their heads, to spend the night in Uganda.
The musical, this beast of a stage
Classical, sophisticated, popular, in English or French, the sung and danced productions take off.
After Broadway and London, Paris finally finds its voice.
It's a revolution: the French musical asserts itself as a successful genre.
For a long time, from Notre-Dame de Paris to Mozart to rock opera, most attempts were entangled in ridicule.
And successes like Cabaret or Les Misérables carried the halo of mystery.
The arrival of Jean-Luc Choplin at Ch<0xC3><0xA2>telet and Stage Entertainment in Mogador changed the game.
Today, these two scenes handle the titles as hit hits.
The first takes up, this Christmas, his excellent My Fair Lady and announces for the following the world premiere of "Un Américain <0xC3><0xA0> Paris".
In Mogador, "Beauty and the Beast" could well be one of the hits of the season.
On the other stages, musical shows such as "1789", "les amants de la Bastille" and small musicals such as "Disco" or "Life and Times" are in tune with success and quality.
Patrick Niedo, author of the reference book "Histoires de comédies musicales" and lecturer at the Thé<0xC3><0xA2>tre du Ch<0xC3><0xA2>telet, analyzes the reasons for the hard-won success.
How do French musicals evolve?
The offer has increased.
First, there are the "musical shows" that evolve at the discretion of the producers...
Some use beautiful projections of images and a real story as in 1789, the Lovers of the Bastille.
Others jump back fifteen years on the pretext that you can serve just about anything when you have Matt Pokora at the top of the bill.
Then we have the musicals with the sumptuous productions of Le Ch<0xC3><0xA2>telet that bring us back to the golden age of Broadway and discover the world of Stephen Sondheim, the greatest composer alive.
Stage Entertainment popularizes Anglo-Saxon variety musicals by adapting them into French.
Independent French producers are trying to make a breakthrough.
But ongoing projects like “Rent,” “The Spider-Woman’s Kiss” or “Spring Awakening” are struggling to be funded.
Do we have enough capable artists like on Broadway to sing, play and dance?
In Paris, when there are eight musical shows in a season, it's a great year.
We have 200 talented artists who turn projects into projects.
In the United States, the birthplace of the musical, it is very different.
Young people are trained in these trades in many schools.
Jobs are plentiful among regional theaters, tours, Broadway, off-Broadway...
The pool of talent is as large as the number of positions to be filled.
Why are provincial tours so successful?
With the exception of opera, the province remains the poor relative of culture in France.
Few plays go on tour and it is often boulevard theatre intended for adults and not young adults.
Musical performances fill this gap.
These are the same young people who love reality TV and what it produces as ephemeral stars...
Proposing beautiful young men (often talented) at the head of a musical show, is the assurance of a craze for these young girls and often their entire family.
The Facebook pages of these shows are skilfully maintained by professionals who answer questions.
These shows are highly anticipated when they arrive in a provincial Zenith.
The mayonnaise is grown in Paris and tasted by the provincials.
The show is designed to enter all the great halls of France in the same form as in Paris.
Serious injury in an accident with a phantom driver in the Brussels ring
A road accident caused a serious injury, Friday morning at about 5:30 am, in the inner ring of Brussels at the height of Hoeilaart, in the direction of Waterloo.
A driver's car was struck by a phantom driver, who is unharmed.
The ring was closed to traffic until 9:00 a.m. at the scene of the accident, until the road was cleared and an expert determined the circumstances of the accident.
This situation, however, did not cause any traffic jams because the accident took place at the Hoeilaart exit.
The circulation could therefore be diverted by this exit/entry of the ring.
A child seriously injured in an attraction at Disneyland Paris
A five-year-old boy was seriously injured in an accident at a Disneyland Paris attraction.
His life prognosis is no longer compromised but he is still hospitalized.
At the time of the fall, the boy was with his father on a boat of the attraction "Pirates of the Caribbean".
It was closed until further notice.
DRC: the army is preparing a new assault
Children play on a charred armored vehicle that belonged to M23 rebels in Kibumba, eastern DRC, on October 31, 2013.
The Congolese army was preparing Friday for a new assault against the last strongholds of the M23 rebels near Bunagana, in eastern DRC.
The objective is to dislodge the M23 from the hills overlooking Bunagana.
Yesterday we took the hill of Bugina, which overlooks that of Mbuzi.
Today, Mbuzi should fall by itself.
Only the hill of Runyonyi will remain.
"The one in Chanzu is not very strategic," North Kivu governor Julien Paluku told AFP.
Mr Paluku plans to travel to Bunagana on Saturday.
A political stronghold and the last stronghold of the rebellion, this locality is located on the Ugandan border, about 80 km north of Goma.
It was taken over by the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo on Wednesday.
Since then, a few hundred irreducibles of the M23, are entrenched at almost 2,000 meters above sea level on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and the nearby town of Jomba.
In Jomba, a resident who had reported close fighting on Thursday throughout the day said the situation was "calm since this morning".
According to him, a woman and her child were killed by the fighting the previous day and were buried.
A girl was shot and three other people were wounded, including one seriously, who was evacuated by FARDC, said the witness quoted by AFP.
Since the resumption of fighting between FARDC and rebels on 25 October, the two warring parties have not reported any loss of life.
NSA revelations increase corporate paranoia about state surveillance
On a beautiful day in late August, a German police helicopter flew low over the British Consulate in Frankfurt, the financial capital of Germany.
By order of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German national intelligence agency, its mission was to photograph the roof of the American outpost, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media said the BfV hoped to identify the presence of listening antennas and that the operation prompted an exchange between the United States and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, the director of U.S. intelligence, again insisted in September that the U.S. does not use its foreign intelligence capabilities to “steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of U.S. companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits.”
But since Edward Snowden, the consultant turned whistleblower, began to reveal his inexhaustible treasure trove of information about the secrets of US surveillance, European governments and business leaders no longer know whether to take the director at his word.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency spied on Brazilian oil company Petrobras and accessed data held by U.S. cloud storage service providers, including Google and Yahoo, have more than ever sparked corporate paranoia about state surveillance.
The revelation that German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone had been hacked, perhaps even for a decade, was the last straw.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then business leaders are surely also potential targets.
Snowden made the intensive collaboration between U.S. intelligence and business transparent.
I believe it is conceivable that this data could be used in their mutual interest.
“Germany needs to wake up,” says Oliver Gr<0xC3><0xBC>n, president of BITMi, which represents German SMEs in the IT sector.
German companies believe the United States poses as much of a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by consulting firm EY.
However, in all the documents unveiled by Mr. Snowden, there is no indication to date that the United States has passed on trade secrets from foreign companies to American companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU does not have sufficient computing and internet capacity and believe that it should strive to reduce its dependence on the US.
Business leaders are skeptical about this.
A member of the German parliament says that we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again.
“It’s not the right way to do it,” says Hasso Plattner, president of German enterprise software company SAP.
If we wanted a strong European IT industry, then we shouldn’t have let it die 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars to farmers.
Anything but the IT industry.
Yet the scale and sophistication of U.S. spy agencies exposed by Snowden’s revelations has come as a shock to some companies that previously thought China posed the biggest surveillance risk.
A big change is taking place in cloud computing as European officials have become aware that data held in the US is governed under the laws of that jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a professional body, about 10% of non-U.S. members gave up their plans to use a U.S. cloud storage service provider after the revelations about the U.S. Prism data mining program.
Jim Snabe, co-director of SAP, said: “Our customers are asking us today a question they didn’t ask us a year ago: where is my data stored and can you guarantee that it will physically remain in that jurisdiction?”
Many German leaders point out that the latest reports are just a confirmation of what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and that this data must therefore be kept at all costs.
It is not surprising that there is economic espionage.
There's always been one.
“This has been a recurring topic for many years and nothing has fundamentally changed in the current discussion,” said Kurt Bock, managing director of chemical producer BASF.
The Americans are spying on us commercially and industrially just as we are spying on them, because it is in the national interest to defend our companies.
Business leaders are generally reluctant to disclose the preventive measures they have put in place, in case this would leave the advantage to an opponent.
Big business has long hammered the message that it’s unwise to pick up a free USB key at a trade show or leave a laptop unattended in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the board of directors of car manufacturer Audi, says that the collection of mobile phones before board meetings, so that they can not be used as remote listening devices, has been a common practice for years.
Germany’s BfV advises its leaders to consider using simple prepaid mobile phones when travelling abroad because of the risk of damaging the integrity of smartphones.
Prepaid mobile phones are then discarded.
However, there are concerns that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to piracy and surveillance.
In Germany, many SMEs are world leaders in their particular niche.
“SMEs often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect their trade secrets from unauthorized access,” the BfV warned in a report.
The United States alerts its own companies to the economic espionage activities carried out by other countries.
The U.S. National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) in February cited France, as well as Russia and Israel, as second-degree economic intelligence-hackers behind China, according to The Washington Post.
A board member of a well-known German company felt that when it comes to economic espionage, “the French are the worst.”
Bernard Squarcini, former director of French domestic intelligence, the DCRI, said in an interview this month: “The services know perfectly well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, spy on their allies.”
Parents of Georgia teenager, who died under unusual circumstances, think their son was murdered
The parents of a Georgia teenager, whose body was found in a rolled-up wrestling mat in his high school gymnasium, believe their son was murdered, the family’s lawyer said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdosta, Georgia, was found stuck in a carpet standing behind the bleachers of his high school gymnasium on Jan. 11.
Lowndes County Sheriff’s investigators have concluded that Johnson died under unusual circumstances, but the 17-year-old boy’s family disputes these findings.
“They are absolutely certain that their son was murdered,” Benjamin Crump, the lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never thought he was dead as stated in the sheriff's findings.
“They think it defies all logic, the laws of physics as well as common sense,” Crump added.
They are convinced that these findings were made for the sole purpose of covering the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
“They sent their son to school with a schoolbag and we gave him back to them in a body bag,” he added.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday he was conducting an official investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several important questions remained unanswered.
What is the cause of death?
Was his death the result of a criminal act?
Moore spoke at a press conference Thursday afternoon.
I'll follow up on the facts, wherever they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
“I consider that there is a sufficient basis” to open an official investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the first autopsy indicated Johnson had died of “positional asphyxia.”
However, a second autopsy identified another cause of death, according to Moore.
“There are still a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed,” he said.
Moore added that if he uncovers evidence to justify a civil or criminal investigation into Johnson’s death, he will ask the FBI to conduct it.
The representative of the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office was not available to give us his opinion when we contacted him on Thursday.
A judge in southern Georgia on Wednesday ordered authorities to hand over all video surveillance footage investigators had examined.
The teen's parents said they hoped the video footage contained clues to the circumstances of his death.
CDC Releases Advice on Child Allergies to Schools
On Wednesday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a series of guidelines on how to manage children’s food allergies at school.
This is the first set of guidelines released by the U.S. government, as the number of school-age children with food allergies has skyrocketed.
One in 20 children in the United States today suffers from a food allergy.
The CDC found that the prevalence of food allergies in children had increased by 18% between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information for schools on how to educate faculty and staff about food allergies in children, and how to treat them in the event of an allergic reaction.
He also recommends schools have a stockpile of epinephrine — the EpiPen-branded auto-injector being the most commonly used — so they can respond quickly to potentially life-threatening anaphylaxis.
State legislatures have recently updated regulations to make it easier for schools to stock epinephrine.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms reported by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, “I feel like something is stinging my tongue,” “I feel like I have a hair on my tongue,” or “I have tingling on my tongue.”
The NSA case underlines the total absence of debate on intelligence
How to explain the contradictory attitude of the French government, which on the one hand is offended in public by summoning the ambassador of the United States on October 21, and on the other forbids the overflight of the territory by the Bolivian presidential plane, based on the rumor of the presence on its board of Edward Snowden?
In my opinion, there are two levels of response from the French government.
When Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande calls Barack Obama or when Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius summons the U.S. ambassador, they react to a real discovery, which is that of the extent of American surveillance on all communications in France.
Is it not surprising to read in the columns of Le Monde a few weeks apart on the one hand the reproduction of the American diplomatic correspondence and on the other hand a condemnation of the NSA's eavesdropping on the Quai d'Orsay?
Wouldn't it be like a vague hypocrisy on your part?
The journalistic approach is not a moral positioning, but the search for the interest and relevance of information that allows each citizen to forge an opinion.
When WikiLeaks lifts the veil on the analysis by American diplomacy of political and other issues around the world, we consider that, in the eyes of American power, this constitutes an important illumination.
When we describe American interception systems against French diplomacy in the United States, it is by no means to be outraged by this practice, it is to describe the world as it is.
Did France benefit from information provided by the NSA regarding terrorist operations aimed at our interests?
Is it possible to avoid American collaboration?
The implementation of very powerful technological interception tools by the United States, but also by France, has been officially justified by the fight against terrorism for roughly ten years.
Moreover, in this area, France and the United States in particular have put in place procedures for cooperation and exchange of information that are almost daily and that are described on both sides as essential.
As an example, the presence of Mohammed Merah in the tribal areas in Miranshah was reported to the French through the means of the NSA.
France can be led, for example, to transmit entire blocks of data on the Sahel region to the American services, and, in return - it was already quickly said - the Americans can give information to the French about other regions of the world.
So the underlying issue behind this NSA affair is not so much the ability or the right of countries to equip themselves with interception tools, but the question of the total absence of prior debate, especially within parliaments, on the justification of such systems, the perimeter that must be theirs, and, ultimately, the question of infringements of freedoms.
What does the United States really risk? a degradation of its image?
No matter how we denounce them, I do not see how they can be punished.
The risk to Americans can be twofold.
The first is when their allies – and this has been the case recently – learn that their leaders, sometimes at the top of their state, have been surveilled.
This is the case of Brazil and Germany, two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States have been strained.
Another effect may be more economical: more and more European or South American companies are reluctant, in light of the revelations, to entrust their confidential data to US service providers subject to US laws, and therefore to the grip of the NSA.
Finally, the large-scale disclosure movement by media outlets around the world, which is helping to spark a debate on the surveillance practices of the intelligence services that until now have been virtually non-existent, could push legislators, including the Americans, to reconsider the powers they have given to their intelligence services.
Parents of intersex children can choose 'indeterminate sex'
Germany has become the first European nation to recognize a third sex for infants born with ambiguous sex organs.
The male or female sex of newborns will no longer be rigidly assigned to them at birth.
Under the new law, parents will no longer be required to declare their child’s gender, allowing them to enter an “indeterminate” or “unspecified” gender on their birth certificate.
The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure on the shoulders of parents who could make hasty decisions about sex reassignment surgery for their infants, and to combat discrimination against intersex people.
According to the BBC, an intersex person would have said years later, “I am neither a man nor a woman.”
I will remain the patchwork created by the doctors, bruised and smeared.
It is estimated that one in every 2,000 children born each year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, with intersexuality being part of the group of sixty diseases diagnosed as disorders of sexual development, a generic term referring to people with atypical chromosomes or gonads (ovaries or testes) or abnormally developed sexual organs.
Wallis Simpson could have been intersex.
Sex identification is still not well understood, but most specialists in the United States say that when sex can not be determined, it is better to use the best available information to assign it, and then wait and monitor the psychological and physical development of the child before considering a surgical act, if any.
Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist in New York who specializes in sexual identification issues, said the new German law “seems to be a good idea.”
Intersex children pose an ethical dilemma.
“Some people suffer from extremely serious diseases that require surgery, but most children do not,” he added.
It is possible to make a sexual assignment without surgery, and see how the identity develops.
The science of how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very precise.
No one can answer the question of why this happens.
It's like the mystery that surrounds gay people.
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex people as different from transsexual or transgender people, since their status is not related to sex but rather to their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively that of a man nor exclusively that of a woman, but is generally both at the same time and not clearly defined as either.
These characteristics can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics, (such as muscle mass, hair, chest and stature), primary sexual characteristics (such as reproductive organs and sexual organs) or the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provided an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in employment, as well as the extent of harassment and violence and prejudice-based crimes.
Young boys of the non-conforming gender now have camps specially designed for them.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to enter male, female or “third sex” on their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian woman, Norrie May-Welby, became the first person in the world to be recognized as “neutral” after winning her appeal process that allows her to keep an “unspecified” sex for life.
German passports will carry a third designation next to M or F-X for intersex, according to the interior ministry.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still the subject of controversy, according to a report on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of legislators from this fundamentally Catholic country signed a petition calling for “gender theory” to be removed from school textbooks.
The American website Catholic Online also opposed the German law, writing that "since the world is dragged into a new reign where gender is a choice but sexual activity is not one, two other pillars of civilization are overturned."
In Maryland, the mother of an infant also said on Baby Zone that she would prefer a gender to be assigned to babies at birth.
“The role of parent is stressful enough without additional restrictions, especially if you don’t know the gender of your child,” she said on the website for young parents.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born without male or female sex organs were called hermaphrodites, after the beautiful Greek god who had a double sex.
And barely a decade ago, the medical community looked at gender as a slate, which can be erased and redrawn.
But now there are many who question the ethical basis of surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex and that sometimes doctors can be wrong, not knowing how a child will feel his sexual reassignment when he grows up.
“In the middle of the 20th century, it was called a psychiatric emergency,” Drescher said.
When these children were born, we didn't call the psychiatrist, we called the surgeon.
The dominant theory on how to treat children with ambiguous sex organs was launched by Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who considered gender malleable.
He enshrined the term “sex identity” and argued that social and environmental cues – the way parents raise a child – interact with a child’s genes and hormones to shape it so that it is identified as male or female.
But in one 1966 case, known as “John/Joan,” his theories gave rise to controversy.
He had advised the parents of a little boy whose penis had been cut off during a botched circumcision to have him castrated entirely, also removing his testicles, and to raise him as a girl.
“Money presented this as a successful transition case, but it wasn’t,” Drescher said.
At the age of about 15, he became a boy again and married a woman.
At the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said some doctors “always repeat this pattern.”
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, those who survived these gender reassignment operations say "[that] they are not satisfied with the outcome."
This is the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes but ambiguous sexual organs.
Doctors couldn’t really tell if he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced he could never have a “satisfying life” as a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce underwent surgical removal of the external organ and testicles and was raised as a girl.
She was given female hormones at the age of 12.
“I knew I wasn’t a girl,” he told ABCNews.com.
I wasn't happy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he had a vaginoplasty.
But depressed and realizing that something was wrong, he asked for his medical records.
What he found horrified him.
I was sterilized at birth – and no one had ever told me.
Bruce was born with a sexual development disorder (SDD) that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for his sexual organs to develop.
After learning the truth, he became a man again, following a testosterone treatment and had his breasts removed.
The surgery rendered him sterile.
Today, he champions the cause of others in an organization called the Interface Project, which attempts to normalize the perception of intersex people.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, executive director of the California-based non-profit Advocates for Informed Choice, fears that German law “invites labeling and stigmatization.”
“Many activists are concerned that German law encourages parents to make quick decisions and gives their child an ‘indeterminate’ sex,” she said.
We are afraid that it will encourage interventions.
We think it would be better to assign a male or female sex, and wait.
But we did not see what the law was going to give, so we can only make assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports Australian law because it “allows adults to choose to be recognized as the third sex.”
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about legal gender,” she added.
German law deals with the attribution of sex at birth.
This is not a battle that young children should be fighting at this age.
When they grow up, they will be able to make decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a radiologist specializing in mammograms in Pittsburgh whose daughter has a sexual development disorder and who helps thousands of people in a support group, said the German law will “hold parents and children accountable.”
Dr. Baratz’s daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but suffers from a DDS called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Due to the failure of her androgen receptors, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.
Now 29, Katie is married and interned in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is infertile, she hopes to have children through adoption services or surrogate mothers.
“The law gives parents some latitude so they don’t have to make hasty decisions,” Baratz said.
This gives them time to do certain tests and understand them, and a time to register "male" or "female."
So, everything is fine – you can raise your child and love him.
You have a beautiful baby and enjoy the pleasure of being a parent.
You do not have to rush for surgery that is irreversible.
“This puts children at the heart of the decision and alleviates the sense of anxiety that motivates parents because they are afraid of not doing the right thing,” she said.
Finally, the child will decide which sex he/she feels most comfortable with – and that’s a great thing.
This allows the child to make the decision for himself.
Letta confident in the longevity of his government
Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta says his government will hold until 2015 despite strong tensions between left and right in the ruling coalition ahead of the Senate vote to oust Silvio Berlusconi from his mandate.
In an interview with the daily La Stampa, the centre-left leader said he “strongly intends” to continue governing with his coalition until the next parliamentary elections in 2015.
The upper house of the Italian parliament will meet later this month to decide the fate of the former council president convicted of tax fraud in August.
Silvio Berlusconi threatens to withdraw his support for the government if the Senate, where he has more opponents than supporters, pronounces his dismissal.
But part of his camp, grouped around the National Secretary of the People of Freedom (PDL) Angelino Alfano, continues to support the government, as demonstrated on October 2 his refusal to yield to the injunctions of Berlusconi who already wanted to bring down the cabinet.
The L.A. Times reports that a U.S. Transportation Security Agency agent, TSA, and a suspect were injured during the exchange of gunfire.
Firefighters at the scene said they had responded to a call of "multiple injuries".
"Law enforcement is in place," the airport said on its Twitter account, as television footage showed people being evacuated in ambulances.
"There was a shooting," a spokesman for the U.S. Transportation Security Agency (TSA) told AFP.
ABC's local antenna showed one person being evacuated on a stretcher, and a second being transported on a wheelchair.
The incident occurred at about 9:30 a.m. local time (12:30 p.m. in Montreal) at the airport's Terminal 3, the airport said.
The Los Angeles Times reports that the evacuations are underway.
The TSA spokesman was not immediately able to confirm whether any of its employees were injured.
All flights arriving and departing from the airport have been suspended.
Israeli army kills Hamas member in Gaza
Israeli tank fire on Thursday killed a Palestinian Islamist Hamas militant and seriously wounded another in the southern Gaza Strip, health officials said.
A Hamas source said fighting broke out in the area as Israeli tanks crossed the border and were targeted by Palestinian mortar fire.
The Israeli army only spoke of a “targeted action” in the area near a tunnel described as “terrorist” by the Jewish state, dug at the border and whose discovery was announced in mid-October.
Report: Obama Campaign Considered Dropping Biden for Hillary Clinton
Obama’s closest advisers have secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list, according to the New York Times.
This revelation is the highlight of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann’s highly anticipated 2012 campaign book, “Double Down: Game Change 2012.”
The Times obtained a copy of the forthcoming book and reported late Thursday that the president’s close aides had conducted “extensive group work and polls in late 2011” to see if Biden’s ouster could help Obama with his re-election bid as his hopes dwindled.
According to Times political correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book offers a detailed analysis of the work of senior campaign and White House officials, namely former White House Secretary General Bill Daley, to gauge what effect the replacement of the vice president by former Secretary of State Clinton might have on the election.
The possibility of an exchange is a secret that has been fiercely guarded within Chicago’s campaign headquarters and within the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen close advisers to the president — including Daley, former Obama campaign chairman Jim Messina and former White House advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe — knew the change was under consideration.
“Double Down” indicates that Daley led the charge to replace Biden, despite their “close personal ties,” before finally deciding against the change when the numbers showed that having Clinton on the presidential list “didn’t significantly improve Obama’s chances of success.”
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had indeed considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
“I said I looked at a whole series of questions, and that was one of them,” Daley told the newspaper.
Remember at that time, the president wasn't in shape, and so we were like, "Lord, what can we do?"
While Daley called the review "concerted," Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign invested heavily in finding out if the change would be beneficial in the election.
“Campaigns don’t spend a lot of money on polls and focus groups unless they seriously consider taking action,” Martin said on AC360.
However, it is not known whether Obama was aware that his team was reviewing the replacement.
Martin told CNN that he had asked Daley if his then boss was aware of the possible reshuffle.
Although Daley said he didn’t think the president “was aware” of the potential change, the former secretary general admitted it was “possible” that Obama knew.
Martin added that “Double Down” did not definitively answer the question of whether political polls had arrived on Obama’s desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama didn’t know that Biden’s removal from the presidential list was being considered.
“Maybe,” Martin replied.
Would you like some ice cream?
A British entrepreneur has created the world’s first jellyfish-based fluorescent ice cream.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a luminescent snack.
He got the idea after reading a study on jellyfish and convinced Chinese scientists to chemically recreate the glowing protein.
Ice cream reacts with the tongue by increasing the pH of the protein to make it shine.
Chris explains that since ice cream starts to glow when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, the more you lick, the brighter it gets.
Charlie, the founder of the Lick Me I'm Delicious ice cream company, said: "It's an incredible thing but we're just getting started in terms of production, and 2g of this stuff costs around <0xC2><0xA3>200."
The protein we use in ice reacts with the tongue at neutral pH.
So when your mouth heats up the protein, the pH level rises and the ice starts to glow.
We tested it over the last few months and it seemed opportune to share it with everyone at Halloween time as it gives an extraordinary glowing effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice I've ever created because jellyfish luminescence is four times more expensive than gold.
So each ball costs me about <0xC2><0xA3>140.
But she's got pretty good taste!
The Bristol-based company with Charlie’s experimental approach is known for its unusual ice cream scents such as beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But its next creation promises to be even more ambitious.
He added: “I would really like to develop an invisible ice.”
This is inherently impossible because of the refraction caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream, but I think I will find a way to get there.
Ice uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish synthesized by Chinese scientists.
Lou Reed died during a tai chi session
Singer Lou Reed died while doing tai chi exercises, his wife Laurie Anderson revealed Thursday in a letter published by the regional newspaper "East Hampton Star" and aimed at residents of the town of Springs, where the couple had a home.
The artist died last Sunday, at the age of 71.
"He died Sunday morning, while looking at the trees and performing the famous 21st movement of tai chi, with his musician's hands that split the air," writes Laurie Anderson.
Lou Reed was a tai chi master, a Chinese martial art.
The singer's wife also explains that she had promised her husband, the week before his death, to get him out of the hospital and take him to their home in Springs (Long Island).
Lou and I have spent a lot of time here over the last few years.
And even though we are city dwellers, it is our spiritual home.
“Lou was a prince and a fighter, and I know that his songs about the pain and beauty of the world will pass on to many people the tremendous joy of life that he had.”
Lou Reed had a liver transplant in May.
Halloween 2013: In numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, go to bed late, and dress up to go to the neighborhood.
Today, I have become more sloppy.
For the past two years, I have not distributed a single candy and I certainly will not do so again this year.
But the stats show I'm the black sheep when it comes to Halloween.
The majority of Americans — 158 million of them in fact — will celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
What I look forward to at every Halloween party are the trends.
Costumes are expected to account for $1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, inanimate sexy objects are raging.
Women no longer need to be sexy professionals; they can also be sexy foods like pizzas, hamburgers, and carrots.
As for the men, I expect to see a lot of zombies, thanks to the TV series The Walking Dead, and I bet the spacemen from Daft Punk will be among our Instagram pics this year.
According to Google, the most sought-after disguises are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess it's okay to stay traditional.
We disguised our dogs last year and, to my amazement, they were not the only ones.
In fact, Americans will spend $330 million on animal costumes this year, according to the NRF.
That makes a lot of curious dogs disguised as hotdogs.
When it comes to sweets, you don't squirt.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion on candy this year, according to Nielsen.
This represents approximately 272 million kg of Hershey bars, lollipops, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark bars.
This is great news for the 41 million children who hunt candy in their neighborhood, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
In fact, we are going to buy and, let’s not tell stories, consume 41 million kilograms of chocolate during Halloween.
Corn candies are the only thing you don’t want to eat, and yet nearly 16 million pounds are sold for Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association.
That’s about 9 billion grains of corn.
It is a mystery that I have not yet been able to solve.
Nothing is more representative of Halloween than haunted houses.
They carry the best names, such as “Terror Behind the Walls,” “Howl-O-Scream” and “The House of Shock.”
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the U.S., which generate about $500 million in revenue, according to America Haunts, and that includes those great pictures of you pissing on each other that your friends put on Facebook that you can’t take off and on which a guy you like leaves a “pretty head”-style comment.
Finally, let’s talk about pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to The Big Pumpkin when we were kids, and carving a pumpkin in the shape of a lantern is like decorating a Christmas tree – it’s something you’ve been doing since you were little.
Luckily for us, the “pumpkin baby trend” only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us carved these pumpkins and didn’t have to sit in them.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The lantern pumpkins that are slowly wilting on the porch of your home probably came from Illinois, where 542 million pumpkins were grown this year.
If you’re looking to get noticed more, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try sculpting their 922kg pumpkin.
Royal Bank of Scotland will create an in-house “bad bank” structure of <0xC2><0xA3>38bn of the riskiest assets, designed to ease its relationship with London and speed up its reprivatisation.
The bank wants to reduce the proportion of doubtful assets on its balance sheet from 55% to 70% in the next two years and hopes to have it completely cleaned up within three years.
RBS also said it would write down an additional <0xC2><0xA3>4 billion to <0xC2><0xA3>4.5 billion in write-downs over the quarter, a writing related to the constitution of the cantonment structure.
RBS also said the internal restructuring would free up <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion to <0xC2><0xA3>11 billion of capital, strengthening its lending capacity.
The bank and London stressed that the "bad bank" would make it possible to draw a line under the past, the government having in particular been accused of interfering in the management of RBS.
“We can now move forward, focus on the future and the 90 per cent of assets that make up a really good bank and build a great bank for customers and for the UK,” Chief Executive Ross McEwan told reporters.
Land Rover announces sponsorship of a series of rallies
The interior features bucket seats and 6-point harness belts, as well as an Intercom system.
Options include improved brakes, a service providing access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistics support and vehicle storage between events.
Bowler Motorsport general manager Drew Bowler said: “The rally fans who join Bowler have changed.
Not all of them are experienced, some are looking for excitement and adventure and realistic access to international events.
We are really happy to offer such an approach in partnership with Land Rover and MSA, and we are convinced that it will be a new way to try out different forms of rallying in the UK and internationally, and to prepare for the rigors and realities of rally raids.
We had a lot of fun developing the Defender Challenge vehicle – the championship is really going to be exciting.”
In addition, the Defender Challenge will offer a day of training and testing in February and the opportunity to participate in events in the deserts of North Africa and the Middle East.
Firefighters were called to rescue a lost puppy after it got stuck 15m above the ground on an unstable ledge in a quarry
Ruby, a spaniel cocker, had escaped after a road accident without gravity
She was spotted three days later by a person walking her dog stuck in the quarry.
Firefighters went down abseiling along the cliff to retrieve the dog and save her from certain death
A puppy was lucky enough to escape the worst after firefighters were called to safely retrieve him while he was perched 15m above the ground on the unstable ledge of a cliff.
Ruby, a 9-month-old cocker spaniel, escaped after a road accident on Sunday afternoon and survived for three days alone before being rescued in a career on Wednesday.
Its owners, Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, went to the Flappit quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to find Ruby and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately searched for their lost dog and made a call on social networking sites after she disappeared into the quarry following a minor accident.
Around 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a sharp-eyed person walking his dog spotted Ruby on a ledge in the quarry, stuck 15m above the ground.
A technical rescue team from Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the scene and rappelled down to rescue Ruby using an animal stretcher to transport her to the top of the cliff.
Technical rescue specialist Andy Clayton said: “She was in a precarious situation.”
It was in the middle of the cliff, 15 m from the top and 15 m from the ground.
She didn’t move at all during the rescue – she was frozen.
But she's fine now.
She ate cookies afterwards.
It was a very unusual call.
It's amazing that anyone noticed the dog.
Technical rescue specialist Peter Lau said: “Ruby was very lucky to get away with it unscathed.”
She could have been seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for a checkup; her general condition was satisfactory, apart from exhaustion and dehydration.
Miss Hall, from Halifax in West Yorkshire, said: “I was terrified watching the rescue.”
At first I didn't think she was up there.
It was amazing to have him in my arms again.
The vet said that if she had been too exhausted and she had fainted, she would probably have fallen.
The firefighters were amazing.
What they did was really brave.
We are so grateful to them, each of them has been absolutely wonderful.
Mr. Alderson, of Keighley, added: "We were afraid it would fall but it didn't move."
The firefighters were great.
I can't believe she was up there.
Mick Jagger says he never flirted with Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview on an Australian radio show this week, the pop star said she was backing vocals on Jagger's "Old Habits Die Hard" in 2004.
Perry said he had dinner with the rock veteran and explained, "He cared about me when I was 18."
She added, “That was a long time ago, and he was very kind.”
In a statement Thursday, a representative for Jagger, 70, said he "categorically denies making any advances to Katy Perry."
The representative added, “Maybe she’s confusing him with someone else.”
Perry was one of the singers to make an appearance on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
His new album, Prism, hit number one on the charts this week.
Beijing calls into question Turkmen Islamic movement
"The behind-the-scenes support for the attack came from the Islamic Movement of East Turkestan based in Central and West Asia," the head of China's security agencies told a Hong Kong television channel, according to a video posted late Thursday on a website.
Meng Jianzhu, who is a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC), was speaking in Tashkent during an official visit to Uzbekistan.
This is the first time a Chinese official has designated a particular organization after Monday's attack.
According to Chinese police, three Uighurs from the same family in the predominantly Muslim region of Xinjiang, bordering several Central Asian countries, rushed their car loaded with cans of gasoline into the entrance to the Forbidden City in Beijing, in a suicide attack that left two dead and 40 injured.
The driver of the car, his wife and his mother died in the car fire.
The Etim, which claims to be fighting for the independence of East Turkestan, the former name of China’s Xinjiang, was listed by the UN in 2002 as an Al Qaeda-affiliated organization.
The movement is often blamed by Chinese authorities for sporadic unrest in Xinjiang, but its real influence is questioned by several experts.
George Kerevan: The break-up of Europe gives the choice to the Scots
Another day, another disturbing story of independence.
This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the European free movement zone in order to join the EU.
And now we hear stories of passport control in Berwick and a barbed wire border along Hadrian's Wall.
While it is true that Strathclyde's newspaper pointed to the possible economic benefits of greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, this was not in the headlines (and was to be expected).
Nor did anyone say that EU member states spend much of their time circumventing their formal rules when it suits them.
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area at the moment, a continued non-compliance with the rules would be a slim concession that Brussels could offer in return for anything it wants to get from the Scots.
So this is a story that is not one of them.
And a story so old it’s now frozen: I first heard the joke that “independence means passport control” more than 40 years ago.
Yet we have forgotten an interesting point in this interpretation of an old dusty tale.
Why should an independent Scotland follow the instructions of Europe, in fact?
Why exchange the yoke of London for that of Brussels, especially now?
Here is the real news about Europe: the great post-war plan to unify Europe is definitively at a standstill.
With the euro crisis, Project Europe is officially dead.
Across Europe, parties that oppose the EU or advocate abandoning the euro as a common currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party, founded only this year and coming out of nowhere, garnered almost five million votes in the September federal election and removed the Liberal Democratic Party (equivalent to our Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been national opposition to the project of creating a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has marked a turning point.
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, coupled with the burden on national economies through membership of the single currency, has led many to believe that Project Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments running excessive budget deficits – this was only true for Greece.
Instead, the European system has imposed on its members exchange rates favorable to German exporters – something German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the national currency, the countries of southern Europe find themselves with an intrinsic productivity problem vis-<0xC3><0xA0>-vis Germany.
The only recourse is to make dark cuts in wages and public spending – encouraged by Berlin.
Beyond the current fiscal and monetary problems, there is a deeper unease related to productivity in Europe.
Following the “green” energy policies imposed by Brussels – which are a reason to subsidize French and German companies in the energy sector at the expense of the consumer – European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times more for gas than the United States.
This is a crippling disadvantage in terms of costs, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All the wage freezes in the world will not prevent the European petrochemical industry from being penalized by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, the revolt rages, especially in France, one of the EU's great leaders.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport to its political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy on Europe, leaving the French economy in shambles.
The result: Marine Le Pen’s far-right party, the anti-European National Front, has just won a crucial by-election, returning the Socialists to power in third place.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the vote – a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a split of the right will automatically favour the left.
What is Marine Le Pen doing with her newfound popularity with the French white working class?
It wants to use next year’s European elections to create a single, anti-European anti-money bloc in the European Parliament.
If anti-European parties do well in these elections, which is very possible, such a bloc could control the European Parliament for the first time.
This is what I think: very soon, the anti-European and anti-currency sentiment unique in Europe will unify and eventually kill the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will return to something more like the free “Europe of (sovereign) nations” favored by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies may retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will regain their own currency.
I expect the United Kingdom to distance itself from this project, and I hope it will be kind to the United States.
However, Washington’s growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left behind in the Atlantic.
What about Scotland in all of this?
We can decide to be a region of little England (essentially).
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes sending Berlin and Brussels for walks.
I believe that Scotland could come to terms with a freer European agreement provided that we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries would be easier in a non-federal Europe of Nations.
Otherwise, we should imitate Norway and maintain our economic independence.
Scotland’s SNP government is – and it’s worth noting – the most successful anti-austerity political movement in Europe, winning a spectacular majority in 2011 based on its opposition to the dark cuts proposed (and implemented) by Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling and the Conservative/Liberal Democrat coalition that followed.
It would be ridiculous now for Scotland to vote for independence if it is to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early Puberty: Ageing Early
Studies show that African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than white girls.
Physical changes don’t mean puberty is imminent
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible.
Experts believe the obesity epidemic could be a trigger for early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is not as pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in family and child health issues.
Should a mother be worried if her daughter’s breasts and pubic hair start growing at 7 or 8 years old?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics held this week in Orlando, Florida, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, a pediatric endocrinologist, explained that these early physical changes are quite common among young Americans and represent a new norm.
“I spend a lot of time reassuring parents — in general, it doesn’t indicate a rapid progression to full puberty,” Kaplowitz said.
Obvious signs of development, such as bulging breasts, hair under the arms and in the pubic area, and body odors, appear earlier in girls.
But there has been only a slight advance in the age of first menstruation over the past four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12 and a half, up from 12 years three-quarters in 1970.
“Once the breast has started to develop, it takes at least two or three years before the first period appears,” said Kaplowitz, also the author of “Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem.”
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty will develop.
There is debate about what constitutes the actual onset of puberty, but it is considered "early" when the development of the breast is accompanied by sudden growth before the age of 8 years.
In most cases, development slows down or stops – this is something a pediatrician can follow closely.
A more rapid evolution may justify tests carried out by an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatments to delay the onset of the first period and prevent other consequences: premature aging of the bones that can slow growth and a small size in adulthood.
Recommendations for drug and hormone therapy are based on the child's age, development rate, growth rate, and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious with the drugs but acknowledges that “controlling puberty can alleviate some behavioral problems and the feeling for young girls to be different from others.”
The other big problem is understandable: Parents just don’t want their very young daughters to have their period.
“They fear the risk of pregnancy or even how they will handle hygiene issues,” Kaplowitz said.
“It was a shock,” recalls a woman whose daughter had her first period at age 10.
Even though there were signs and we talked about the rules, she wasn’t emotionally prepared.
She came home from school scared and upset to be the first among her friends.
There are many theories brought to the attention of the public about the causes of early puberty.
Yet there is no consistent theory that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages carried by the media are responsible.
Boys, like girls, reach puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz says the most credible hypothesis is that of the obesity epidemic.
He participated in a study of girls aged 6 to 9 years that linked the percentage of fat mass to the onset of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other influential factors.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach the age of puberty earlier than white girls.
There are various explanations.
Globally, the mechanisms of early puberty seem to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another problem: Although boys have younger facial and pubic hair, the trend toward true early puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other physicians attending the PAA conference emphasized the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common, even in infants and toddlers.
“We need to be careful about how we identify the true onset of puberty,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist working at Goryeb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to ask their pediatrician for advice on how to talk with their child.
“It can mean having a conversation earlier than expected,” Kaplowitz explained.
If you stay calm, your child will generally react well.
Girls whose puberty is early need to be reassured that even when it happens sooner than expected, the process is part of life.
Tribute to the Coen Brothers
Coen Brothers’ “Inside Llewyn Davis” is a nostalgic and funny film about the Greenwich village of 1961 and the folk music that was just beginning to resonate there, before the arrival of Bob Dylan.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose filmography has just been the subject of a retrospective at the Cinémath<0xC3><0xA8>que fran<0xC3><0xA7>aise, had won the Palme d'Or at Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink.
In the absence of being able to hire Dylan or the trio Peter, Paul and Mary, Joel and Ethan Coen have set their sights on the rising star of American cinema, Oscar Isaac, 33, but also on the pop global star Justin Timberlake.
In this humorous film where music is a central character and songs are performed live, Oscar Isaac reveals himself to be an accomplished folk musician and singer, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, leaves pop for folk music with an infectious jubilation.
As for Carey Mulligan, she left the rich garb of Daisy Mulligan in "The Magnificent Gatsby" for less gleaming clothes, a soft voice when she sings, but the swearing-in machine gun when she speaks.
"Inside Llewyn Davis" tells about a week of the tribulations of a folk singer who can not break through and gets angry with the whole world.
He accepts stand-up replacements in the studios.
Without accommodation, he makes the tour of the sofas of his friends who still want to receive him.
An air of documentary
“His relationship with success is tortured, that’s what interested us: a mix of bad luck, a guy who’s not there at the right time, who’s not a careerist, but who has integrity, with self-destructive behavior,” Ethan Coen, who was crowned with his brother Joel at several Oscars and awards at Cannes, told the press.
If Llewyn Davis did not exist, the two filmmakers fans of folk music built their story on real personalities of the time such as folk musician Dave Von Ronk.
The idea was to show the moment before the advent of Greenwich village, this neighborhood of New York called to become "the epicenter of the rise of folk music that would spawn international stars" as the journalist Elijah Wald, friend of Van Ronk.
The film then takes on the look of a documentary, from the dusty music label invaded by unsold 33T inhabited by an old unpayable secretary, to the musical choices of the studios of the time and the cafes where the singers performed.
The magic of the Coen brothers still operates by integrating a funny character that crosses the film permanently: a beautiful red cat with a cracking look, Llewyn Davis’s companion of fortune.
Asked how he composed his character, actor and singer Justin Timberlake recalled having "grown up in Tennessee, bathed in the blues and country".
“My first music lessons were given to me by my grandfather who taught me how to play the guitar,” he added.
For Justin Timberlake, if work is necessary to "be considered good", "chance can also launch someone's career", and "more and more today".
Like Llewyn Davis who refuses to compromise on her music, the pop star explains that in a career, "the most important thing is not to get stuck by everything that can prevent us from expressing ourselves".
Gérard de Villiers, the author of "SAS", is dead.
He never knew the word retirement.
A phenomenon of the French edition, Gérard de Villiers, who died Thursday at 83, had just published his 200th SAS, "La Vengeance du Kremlin".
In February, the New York Times called him “the spy novelist who knew too much.”
He had just spent ten days in Afghanistan, the scene of the 198th and 199th opus of the famous series of spy novels.
Physically diminished by a very serious heart attack in December 2010, he was traveling during this trip with a walker.
And before Afghanistan, he had also returned to Libya, Russia, Lebanon and Mali.
With four SAS published per year, Gérard de Villiers, born on December 8, 1929 in Paris, ensured to ignore the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of "SAS <0xC3><0xA0> Istanbul", the first of the series, almost half a century ago.
"No doubt between 120 and 150 million in all countries," he said last March.
His Burmese cat on his knees, in the living room of his huge apartment of a building on Avenue Foch close to the Arc de Triomphe, the malicious eye under his white hair, he cited some of the languages in which the adventures of SAS have been translated: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japanese or Korean.
"Not counting pirate editions," he added, pointing to a pile of books on the coffee table between the bronzes or ivory brought from the 130 countries surveyed to locate his novels.
For the price of a pack of cigarettes, the reader is entitled to the traditional cover with the photo of a young woman with an advantageous chest, carrying a pistol or assault rifle.
Inside, his most serene highness (SAS) Prince Malko Linge, a penniless Austrian aristocrat and CIA contract agent to pay for repairs to the family castle, goes on the hunt for all the bad guys on earth, communists of the 70s and 80s, then jihadists from the 90s.
With each book, the same recipe: a large dose of geopolitics and exoticism, some scenes of hard sex, a zest of violence and torture.
"I never had the pretension of being a literary author," explained Gérard de Villiers.
I consider myself a storyteller who writes to distract people to whom I do not send a message.
He worked "like the great pre-war reporters, the Albert London type, who went to the scene and came back with real and long investigations."
The father of SAS used to say "make a kind of geopolitical soap opera".
"I constantly follow my files (Afghanistan, Syria, ...) before leaving," added Gérard de Villiers.
On the spot, I meet journalists, including those of AFP, diplomats, people of the services that I know for some for twenty or thirty years.
As a result, many of his SAS are often prescient: for example, a month before the attack on a command center of the Syrian regime having killed several senior officials, he had told the story in "The Damascus Way".
In "The Madmen of Benghazi", he was the first to reveal the existence of a secret CIA command center in this city, the cradle of the Libyan revolt.
In 1980, he staged the assassination of Egyptian President Anwar El-Sadat in "The Cairo Conspiracy", a year before the attack.
In October 2012, in "Panic in Bamako", he recounted the columns of 4X4 jihadists who were based in the Malian capital.
I am not a soothsayer, Gérard de Villiers defended himself, I simply make hypotheses from countries that I know well and, from time to time, some of my hypotheses come true.
After these trips to often troubled areas, he settled for a month behind his IBM daisy typewriter dating back to 1976 "whose parts have all been changed".
300 pages later, he wrote the word "END" and corrected each page with a pen.
On the walls of his office hang AK-47 assault rifles, erotic photos and photos of the author with African warlords.
Regularly pinned for machismo by feminist leagues and for racism by human rights organizations, Gérard de Villiers dismissed these accusations in two sentences.
Some women are sexual objects in my books but others are beautiful, intelligent and courageous women.
I am always welcomed in Africa where I have a lot of readers.
Gérard de Villiers had said: "Malko Linge, like all heroes, has no age".
He will not die and will not retire.
No more than I am.
Planemakers quarrel over seat width as big orders come into play
The dispute is raging among major aeronautical manufacturers over the width of the tourist class seats on long-haul flights, paving the way for a bitter confrontation at this month’s Dubai air show.
The dispute is over the width of seats offered on long-haul flights to passengers in economy class – which are not always the most wooed by airlines, but for which the space allocated is essential to increase efficiency gains in the latest aircraft presented by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week, Airbus called on the aviation industry to implement a standard imposing a seat size of at least 18 inches (45.72 cm) in economy classes, but its big American rival Boeing says it should be up to airlines to decide.
The dispute erupted as aircraft manufacturers sought to sell even larger versions of their twin-engined long-haul aircraft, eventually hoping for a record order at the November 17-21 event.
The way the seats will be arranged at the rear of the aircraft – in particular, will there be 9 or 10 front seats – is essential for the economic performance of the mini-jumbo segment.
Boeing says its upgraded “777X” will be able to seat 406 people in economy class in seats that are more than 17 inches wide, and will be configured with 10 seats per row.
Airbus says the competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in economy class in 18-inch wide seats configured in rows of 9.
Aeronautical giants often trade blows on technical issues by advertising in the professional press.
Today, Airbus appeals directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to take over from its competitors with more than 100 orders.
We were recently able to realize what could be the beginning of a new advertising war with the presentation to the financiers of a photo showing three people against each other in the restaurant, entitled "Would you accept this?".
“Boeing offers long-haul flights in narrower seats than regional turboprops,” said John Leahy, Airbus chief commercial officer.
As eating habits change, people get fatter, but seats on airplanes have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long-haul travel, and the turn of the century, the weight of the average American aged 40 to 49 increased by 10%, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
The waistline of the average 21st-century American is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus says its rival is clinging to a seat concept that dates back to the 1950s, when the circumference of the jet set was narrower.
Airbus said it has commissioned a study that says an extra inch of seat width would improve sleep quality by 53%.
Boeing disputes Airbus’ figures on seat width and says it’s not up to manufacturers to decide how airlines balance ticket prices and equipment.
He also says the study shows that the cabin experience doesn’t just depend on the width of the seats.
“It’s really about giving airlines flexibility and allowing them to do what they think they need to do to get things done,” said Kent Craver, head of passenger satisfaction at Boeing.
They don't want to be told what will make them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers, it is more about having some freedom of movement, but for suppliers, it is increasingly an issue that could affect their results.
Behind the dispute is a race to control aircraft for an estimated amount of at least $700 billion at market price in the coming decades, enough to tip the balance of U.S. and European exports.
As Reuters first reported in July, the configuration of the seats is exactly what is fueling the battle between the latest aircraft.
Airbus and Boeing both claim a per-seat performance in their latest long-haul twin-engine models 20% higher than that of the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
The performance announced by Boeing depends in part on the comparison between the 777X configured with 10 seats per row and an original 777 model configured in rows of 9.
The gain in terms of unit costs is small compared to the device configured with 10 seats per row currently in service.
“Boeing is doing this to accommodate more seats and make its aircraft more competitive with our products,” said Kevin Keniston, director of passenger comfort at European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say the cabins configured with 10 seats per row in the existing 777s suggest that many passengers are in favor of a denser configuration, which can go hand in hand with cheaper fares.
“An 18-inch seat width would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that, from a commercial perspective, Airbus’ proposal is driven by the threat of the 777,” said cabin interiors expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but offer a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines must choose.
Aircraft salesmen who go around the world even take a meter with them to check competing configurations.
While offering comfortable aircraft, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with high-density configurations to low-cost airlines and for regional travel.
Airbus offers a configured A350 with 10 seats per row but says it has not yet sold it.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the need for greater cabin customization by offering wider aisle-side seats on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other major manufacturer of large modern aircraft, experts say it is unlikely that its call to the aviation industry to set a size standard for seats will succeed, but that it could make forget the wave of sales of 777X.
Oracle shareholders angered by Ellison's salary
A majority of Oracle shareholders voted Thursday against the compensation proposal for founder and CEO Larry Ellison, given the financial performance of his group.
The vote is not binding but tarnishes the image of Larry Ellison, third world fortune just haloed of the victory of his boat at the America's Cup.
The billionaire still owns 25% of the capital of the software group he co-founded 40 years ago.
Last year, Ellison received a negative vote on his pay.
The Oracle boss gave up a $1.2 million bonus for the 2013 fiscal year ended in May due to the group’s poor performance, which missed its growth targets, but he collected about $77 million related to stock options.
His fixed salary is only a symbolic dollar.
Over the year-to-date, Oracle's net income rose 3.5%, while the stock price jumped 27.5%, outperforming the S&P-500 index, which rose 24% at the same time.
New nicotine vaccine could suppress the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could suppress the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice for life from nicotine addiction.
Further testing is needed before starting human trials, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the early signs were encouraging.
"We really hope that this kind of vaccine strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to quit, exhausting all the methods available on the market today, but are finding that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches," Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to carry the genetic information needed to design anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begins to produce a steady stream of antibodies.
The antibodies track down all nicotine molecules present in the blood system and neutralize them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from getting his or her dose of nicotine.
In the tests, the vaccinated mice who were then given nicotine continued their activity normally.
But the mice that hadn’t been vaccinated “were soothed,” the researchers said, a sign that nicotine had reached their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines have proven ineffective because they contain antibodies.
Injections had to be repeated so frequently that antibody levels remained high that they were too expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is expected to be much lower as it turns liver cells into antibody factories.
Professor Crystal said that if the future vaccine for human use was completely safe, it could be given to children before they are tempted to try a cigarette, which would prevent any addiction to nicotine.
But it is more likely to be used by smokers who want to quit smoking.
“They’ll know that if they start smoking again, they won’t enjoy it because of the nicotine vaccine, and it can help them lose their bad habit,” he added.
British scientists said the results were interesting but noted that much more research was needed.
Pakistani Taliban leader killed by drone
Pakistani Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Pakistan on Friday, security officials said.
The death of Hakimullah Mehsud has been announced several times in the past.
But intelligence, military and activist leaders said this time that he had lost his life in the strike, which took place in the North Waziristan region.
"We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a drone strike," a senior security official said.
The day before, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, on a trip to London, informed the British government that talks had begun with the Tehrik e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the movement of the Pakistani Taliban.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
Former New South Wales Labour Minister Joe Tripodi will be the subject of an investigation by the state’s anti-corruption regulator.
Former New South Wales minister Joe Tripodi denied changing the commercial lease policy at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties located in the government-controlled area.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation into whether Mr. Obeid had pressured several state ministers to renew his leases in Circular Quay, where the Obeids own two restaurants and a cafe, after they expired in August 2005, without a call for tenders.
It is now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obeid's secret interest in these properties, following the testimony of Mr. Tripodi's former deputy general secretary, Lynne Ashpole, on Thursday.
During the years of discussions that began in 2005, the government lobbied for the leases to be tendered.
The tenants were against it and also wanted longer terms.
In 2009, the Circular Quay leases, which brought in about $2.5 million a year to the Obeids, were renewed without a call for tenders.
Mr. Tripodi, who was Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of tenders.
But he denied changing his policy at the request of Mr. Obeid who, Mr. Tripodi acknowledged, was calling for a change in government lease policy.
The transcript of telephone conversations presented to ICAC showed calls made in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had arrived at the Department of Ports after working under Mr. Obeid at the Department of Fisheries.
"Was the topic discussed during these phone conversations the development of the commercial lease policy?" Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy asked Tripodi.
“No,” Mr. Tripodi replied.
I don't remember what we talked about, but it wasn't that.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli warplanes target Syria, official says
Israeli warplanes hit a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia late Thursday, a military official told Fox News.
The official did not specify what the target was, but said there was at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was Russian-made SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel has conducted airstrikes against missile shipments in Syria.
Foreign workers holding a 457 visa may have to pass an “authenticity” test
The government is currently exploring the possibility of setting up an “authenticity” test for foreign workers holding a 457 visa as it plans to expand enforcement measures.
The test, if adopted, would be applied according to a criterion designed to prevent 457 visas from being used for unskilled positions or as a means of diverting family and friends to Australia.
A government working paper was unveiled today as Labour MP Maxine McKew denounced the government’s speech on foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia’s neighbours.
“The shattering statements about ‘foreigners coming back at the end of the line’ and ‘jobs for Australians first’ are an unpleasant return to the days when unions were demanding a protected labour market,” she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white work had to be protected – and I wouldn’t be surprised if some countries in the region see it as an echo of this historical artifact.
The working paper outlines the 12 measures that had previously been considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka to meet with senior officials to discuss human trafficking, implemented five of the recommended changes, with the others under review.
If the "authenticity" criterion were adopted, a visa applicant could be checked to find out "whether the job offer is authentic in the case where the applicant is a relationship or a personal associate of the owner or the person concerned within the company that sponsors it".
Companies might also be required to report the number of 457 visa holders after some of them, having intended to sponsor a small number of workers, actually employed hundreds of them.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker has reportedly died of a heart attack after arriving on a boat carrying asylum seekers to Christmas Island this week.
The man’s panicked 9-year-old son was travelling to Australia with him and has found some solace since his father died on Wednesday with an adult cousin who was also on board.
The man was rushed by Australian authorities to Christmas Island hospital, where he died.
A study to increase the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland has been launched by the UK Government.
The work carried out by HS2 Ltd suggests that high-speed services to Scotland and northern England will start as soon as Phase 1 opens in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project would “bring the UK together”.
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was "excited" to work with the UK government on the project.
Phase 1 will involve a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase 2 is completed, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government raised the estimated cost of building the high-speed link between London and the north of England from <0xC2><0xA3>32.7 billion to <0xC2><0xA3>42.6 billion.
The UK government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has asked HS2 Ltd to study strengthening rail capacity and improving journey times for northern England and Scotland.
This must include the possibility of travel times between Glasgow and Edinburgh of up to three hours.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our focus for HS2 is on a truly national network that will bring the UK and its cities closer together.”
We are pushing the HS2 project because the benefits are enormous.
Without it, we are faced with a problem of capacity of our railway network.
But it is also a question of developing connectivity between the 18 major British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, so that the links between them are better thanks to HS2.
British Secretary of State for Scotland Alistair Carmichael added: “Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland.”
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr. Carmichael to support "unequivocally" the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: "The high-speed train has the potential to offer considerable economic benefits to Scotland, but it also brings the economic weight of Scotland into the overall high-speed rail network project across Britain.
“We are therefore excited to work in partnership with the UK Government to explore options to bring the high-speed rail network to Scotland, creating an advantage for all and complementing the Glasgow-Edinburgh route that the Scottish Government is already planning.
“I look forward to reading the review report with the UK ministers next year and we will then decide together on the next steps.”
Rules on the use of electronic devices on board remain in force for the time being in Australia
Australian air passengers will have to continue turning off their tablets and smartphones during takeoff and landing despite the U.S. move to relax regulations on electronic devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has left the door open for U.S. carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read e-books, watch videos or play games on their aircraft during critical flight phases as long as they are in “airplane” mode.
Passengers can already do this for most of the flight, but many people find it painful not to be able to access their e-books during takeoff and landing.
Australian carriers are reviewing the decision that requires U.S. carriers to do significant work to meet the requirements, but have indicated that they have no immediate intention of changing their procedures.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it was reviewing the announcement but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical flight phases were still in place in Australia.
“CASA does not have specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices in airplanes,” she said.
The issue is subject to regulations that require aircraft operators to ensure that safety is maintained at all times and passengers to comply with the safety instructions given by crew members.
Virgin, which has already spoken to CASA about its intention to expand the use of its in-flight entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology, was open to a change but said it would follow the regulator.
“We would welcome a revision of CASA that would allow for the use of electronic devices as we truly believe it would enhance the customer experience now that we have (the in-flight entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology) on our aircraft,” a spokesperson said.
Qantas said it was complying with the current rules for the time being.
“Under our current policy, electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we have no immediate intention of changing that,” she said.
The FAA’s decision applies to U.S. airlines.
However, we are still interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers, and we will look closely at the FAA’s decision and the reasons for it.
For U.S. carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will be required to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from electronic devices, as well as review manuals, training materials, hand baggage programs and instructions provided to passengers.
“As soon as an airline has verified the tolerance of its fleet, it may allow passengers to use lightweight portable electronic devices, such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at all altitudes,” the FAA said.
In the rare case of low visibility, the crew will ask passengers to turn off their aircraft during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier aircraft be safely stowed under seats or in upper compartments during take-off and landing.
Pia: at least four injured in violent fight
The small town of Pia experienced an unusual excess of fever on Thursday evening.
Three gendarmerie vehicles, two ambulances and a gathering of about thirty people according to the testimonies collected...
On this Halloween day, the evening was hectic on Pia's side where a brawl involving several people broke out on the Post Office side.
At least four minor injuries were reported.
Alerted, the gendarmes went to the scene to separate the belligerents and ensure that the wounded were taken care of.
Singapore’s pawnshops take advantage of middle classes forced to tighten their belts
At a pawn shop in Singapore's Bendemeer Shopping Centre, Janani Amirthalinga deposits a bracelet, a ring and a pair of gold earrings to pay for her daughters' tuition.
“My husband and I just bought a house so all my money went into it,” says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns $3,000 from Singapore ($2,400) a month as an administrator and her husband also works, monthly family income is not enough, she says.
In fact, demand is such in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is rising – that ValueMax, where it made its transaction, this week became the third pawnshop to be introduced to the Singapore Stock Exchange.
Pledgeing jewelry is not only a quick way to get cash – Singapore’s $1,300 in the case of Ms. Amirthalinga – but it’s almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
In general, Singaporean pawnbrokers charge an effective annual interest rate of 17%, just above the 15.4% offered by United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping centre.
However, pawnshops have the advantage of not asking for credit check or proof of salary, and can unblock loans faster than banks.
As a result, millions of people across the region are turning to pawnbrokers as families feel the pressure of rising living costs and over-indebted households and consumers.
After five years of solid growth since the global financial crisis, and cheap credit fueled by overly lax monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to pawnshops to bridge the gap as their economies slow.
This week, ratings agency Standard & Poor’s cited rising household debt, stemming mainly from rising mortgage lending, as a risk factor for Asian banks’ solvency.
She said Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest household debt-to-gross domestic product ratio in Asia.
Malaysia tops the list with 80 per cent of GDP, up from 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists also fear the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which narrowly emerged this week from a technical recession.
On Thursday, data showed a continued weakness in exports and a slowdown in consumer demand.
“The bottom line is that with rising costs, people at the middle or bottom [of the wage scale] are looking to supplement their income as best they can,” said Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
The historically high prices of gold over the past two years have caused people to rush to pawn their personal belongings to touch the cash value of their jewelry.
In Singapore, about 70% of the pledged items in the city-state’s 200 pawnshops are gold.
People say, "The price of gold is high, let's pawn Grandma's gold chain and we'll come back for it next month."
In Thailand, the largest operator of pawn shops, EasyMoney, has seen a 20% increase in the number of customers using its shops in recent months.
The rise is such in the pawn shop sector that ValueMax, the operator of the Bendemeer store and 15 other stores like this one in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighboring Malaysia – where it already has four stores – but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, its managing director.
The company will fund them using 60 percent of the $66 million it raised this week when it was floated on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some low-rate lenders have faced criticism for the exorbitant interest rates they practice, Ms. Yeah says that pledging not only offers lower rates than other lenders, but also does not directly increase debt.
“Customers are mortgaging assets they already own, and monetizing their personal assets does not increase household indebtedness,” she says.
Pledges are becoming more and more socially accepted as a means of securing guaranteed short-term financing.
People who go to pawnshops are also not just those who have financial problems.
Wealthy Singaporeans also go to ValueMax pawnshops to pawn gold bars or Rolex watches, which can account for up to 60% of their cash purchase price.
We see customers from all walks of life.
“It can be wealthy individuals who need to borrow short-term for business activities or investments, or small businesses who have cash needs to get past a difficult course,” adds Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Pastor accused of child pornography in Nova Scotia
A pastor who cared for youth in the Halifax area of Nova Scotia has been charged with child pornography.
Aaron Hudgins, 30, was arrested Friday morning following searches of his home and the National Research Council office where he works.
The Timberlay Baptist Church, where the pastor officiated, said it was deeply saddened by this news.
In a statement, church officials said Hudgins had resigned from his post.
The pastor was released under conditions.
In particular, it must not communicate with persons under 18 years of age and must not access the Internet.
He will appear in provincial court in Halifax in December.
He goes in a Nazi uniform to the supermarket, before being chased away.
A man wearing a Nazi uniform barred by a swastika armband was asked to leave an English supermarket, with customers complaining to the management of the establishment who called police, the store said Friday.
“We received several complaints from customers, so we asked him to leave the store,” a spokeswoman for supermarket chain Asda said.
The store called police to the rescue, but "by the time it arrived, it was already gone without a fight," she added.
I was standing in line when I saw a woman who seemed upset.
People were mouth-watering.
“You don’t go out like this unless you want to get attention,” Rosina Rusin, a 60-year-old client, told the Cambridge News.
The incident happened Thursday, the day of the Halloween party, where it is customary to dress up as a monster, but it was difficult to know if it was a hoax.
A Cambridge man claimed responsibility for the act on his Twitter account, where he posted images of Adolf Hitler.
"I've been wearing a black SS armband twice a week for three years at Asda," Dutton said, explaining that he suffered from "mental problems".
$325 million rescue plan for Tasmania’s health system
The federal government maintains that the $325 million rescue plan for the faltering health care system has strict conditions in place to ensure that the state government will not waste funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth is currently taking “urgent action” to end a crisis caused by the island state’s aging population, high rate of chronic diseases and system constraints.
The funding, planned for 4 years, was decided after government consultations with the independent MP for Tasmania, Andrew Wilkie.
“The government has proposed an emergency rescue plan that we believe will address the unique challenges facing the state,” Plibersek said today.
The $325 million plan includes a $31 million campaign for non-emergency surgical operations.
An additional 2,600 operations, including orthopaedic surgery and cataract surgery, will help to catch up.
Funding is also provided for walk-in clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better outpatient care, training of medical professionals, mental health services and the deployment of electronic health record systems in local hospitals.
"These investments support the idea that, according to front-line clinicians, this is the best way to care for Tasmania's health care system," Plibersek said.
The minister said the Tasmanian government would face a strict reporting and accountability regime.
The state will need to maintain current funding levels in order to receive money from the Commonwealth and prepare monthly reports on the areas where it spends the additional funds.
A three-person commission will be established to ensure that the State provides services in the most effective and efficient manner possible.
Mr Wilkie said today that the $325 million will not count for much "unless it is followed by real reform to strengthen Tasmania's public health system".
He nevertheless congratulated the government for responding to the request for urgent help that he presented to the Prime Minister in early May.
"I hope the federal aid plan will go a long way in removing Tasmania's public health system from the blacklist," Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these additional non-urgent procedures will largely reverse the recent cuts.
But opposition health critic Peter Dutton said today's announcement was a "solution of fortune".
“The reason we’re here is because the state’s Labor government has taken $430 million out of its health care system,” he told ABC TV.
We can't have a state government ripping out almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth putting in $300 million, and pretend it's a great day.
Mr. Dutton visited Ms. Plibersek to ensure that no dollars from the bailout will be spent on additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux's adaptation of Denis Diderot's novel boasts remarkable artistic direction and meticulous period reconstitution, but it is also more laborious than it should be.
Set in 1760s France, it tells the dark story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent to a convent by her family.
When she rebels, she faces the boundless cruelty of a deliberately sadistic Mother Superior and becomes an object of erotic fascination for another.
The film never focuses on lubricity or sensationalism, and that’s the problem.
The conscientious solemnity of the narration could also become a penance for the public.
Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons production capacity, says watchdog
Syria has destroyed equipment essential to the production of chemical weapons and munitions filled with toxic gas, the international chemical weapons watchdog said on Thursday, as violent clashes raged in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic agents are believed to be stored.
A group of Syrian activists also said on Thursday that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the start of the country’s civil war nearly three years ago.
The announcement by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came one day ahead of the deadline for the
November 1st set by the Hague-based organization ordering Damascus to destroy or “make unusable” all chemical weapons production units and machinery intended to mix toxic gases and fill munitions.
The completion of what is essentially the initial destruction phase is an important step in the ambitious timetable to destroy Damascus’ chemical weapons by mid-2014.
Thanks to the destruction of the equipment, Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus has yet to start destroying existing weapons and stockpiles.
The country is believed to have about 1,000 tons of chemical products and weapons, including mustard gas and the nerve agent sarin.
The announcement came as fighting raged Thursday in the town of Safira, which experts say is home to a chemical weapons production unit as well as storage sites, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported.
The militant group, which tracks the evolution of the human toll through a network of militants based in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Among them, there were an estimated 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, an estimated 29,954 members of President Bashar al-Assad’s armed forces were killed, including 18,678 fighters from pro-government forces and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
Of the dead, an estimated 2,202 were deserters and some 5,375 were opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
On 25 July, the UN estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
It hasn’t updated that number since.
Some 2 million people were forced to flee the country as a result of the conflict.
Assad’s troops have been fighting the rebels, many of whom are linked to al-Qaeda network groups, in Safira for weeks.
The Observatory said on Thursday there were losses on both sides, but gave no details.
The fighting underscored the importance of the dangers facing chemical weapons inspectors as they complete their mission to rid Syria of its toxic arsenal in the midst of a protracted civil war, within tight deadlines.
A statement from the OPCW, which works closely with the UN, said its team was “now satisfied to have controlled – and seen destroyed – all declared critical production and machinery for mixing and filling.”
She added that "no further inspection activities are planned at this time."
Earlier in the week, inspectors said they had completed the first stage of verification work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
They were unable to visit the last two sites because of concerns about their safety, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPCW said the two sites were, according to Syria, “abandoned and ... the elements of the chemical weapons program they contained had been moved to other declared sites, which were inspected.”
It was difficult to know at first glance whether the Safira unit was one of two sites that OPCW inspectors were unable to visit.
Syria submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons which was approved the following month by the OPCW Executive Committee.
“I salute the moral strength and courage you have all shown in the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization,” said Ahmet Uzumcu, director general of the organization, in a commentary published by the OPCW.
Now in its third year, the civil war mainly pits Sunni Muslim rebels against the Assad government and its security forces, which are backed by members of the Alawite sect, a branch of Shiite Islam.
On the other hand, the director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that there was a loud explosion on Wednesday at an air defense base in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion remains unknown, he added.
Anger over the sentence handed down to one of Bali’s bomb-makers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombings reacted angrily to the sentence handed down to the last of the conspirators to be brought to justice, saying Umar Patek should be shot by an execution squad.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of Southeast Asia’s most wanted men, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison for his role in making the explosive devices used in the attacks.
He could be released after 15 years on parole.
The 45-year-old man was convicted of mass murder for the attacks on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injured many.
He was also convicted on numerous other terrorism-related charges, including a wave of attacks on churches across Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors have asked for a life sentence, yet they could have asked for the man, dubbed “Damn Man” for his reputation as a bomb-making expert, to be sentenced to death.
The decision has revived painful memories for June Corteen, a Perth mother who lost her 39-year-old twins, Jane and Jenny, in the destruction perpetrated by Patek and the other conspirators nearly 10 years ago.
On the verge of tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should have followed the same path as the other men.
"He should be dragged in front of the firing squad," Corteen told the PAA.
I have to live every day without having any other grandchildren or seeing my daughters.
The Sari Club was completely destroyed when a huge bomb, loaded into a van parked outside, exploded just after 11 p.m. on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar when a suicide bomber blew up an explosive-laden backpack just 20 seconds earlier.
He fell into a coma the day after the attack and remained unconscious for a month, and he “died” three times while on respiratory assistance.
Hugues said Patek should have met the same fate as the other three members of Jemaah Islamiyah’s terror cell responsible for the carnage – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were executed four years ago.
In reality, this man should have been sentenced to death before the others.
Keep him alive, why, there's no reason to keep him alive.
To spend 20 years in prison after killing 202 people and injuring hundreds more is not much.
Patek is the last of Bali’s bombers to be brought to justice.
He had managed to avoid capture for nearly 10 years but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where US forces will kill former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent said intelligence reports revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an effort to restore ties between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and Al Qaeda.
“He didn’t surrender,” Corteen added.
Until recently, he scoffed at the grief he had caused other people.
The verdict came on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the attacks, which will be celebrated later this year and marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
“There will be a lot of crying this year,” Corteen said.
Patek can, however, appeal his conviction.
FAA: Air passengers can now use gadgets on airplanes (but not make a call with their cell phone)
Airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices from door to door to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music — but not talk on their cell phones — under the new, highly anticipated guidelines released Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect immediate changes.
The speed with which the change will be implemented will vary from airline to airline, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said at a news conference.
Airlines will need to prove to the FAA that their aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated crew training manuals and aircraft stowage rules to be in compliance.
The FAA said it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of electronic devices on their planes.
Delta and JetBlue are among the companies that have already submitted plans.
“Depending on the plan, we may approve expanded use of electronic devices in the near future,” the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers must turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft doors are closed.
They are not supposed to relight until the aircraft reaches an altitude of 10,000 feet and the commander gives the go-ahead.
Passengers are supposed to turn off their aircraft during the descent of the aircraft before landing and not relight them until the aircraft has landed.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference will be able to allow passengers to use their aircraft during takeoffs, landings and ground rollovers, the FAA said.
Most new airliners and other aircraft that have been modified so that passengers can use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes, should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, said she was pleased with the changes.
“Once the new policy is implemented safely – and we will work closely with carriers for that – it will benefit everyone,” Glading said in a statement.
We are frankly tired of feeling like "room supervisors" when it comes to this issue.
But it will still be forbidden to connect to the internet to surf, exchange emails and text messages or download data below 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will have to put their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode.
So still no Words With Friends, the Scrabble-style online game played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011 when he was loudly evicted from an American Airlines plane after refusing to turn off his device while the device was parked at the door.
And heavier devices like laptops will still need to be stowed away because they could injure someone if they flew through the cabin.
Mobile phones on board will also continue to be banned.
The regulatory power over mobile phones rests with the Federal Communications Commission, not the FAA.
The FAA may lift the ban on certain electronic devices during takeoff and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national transportation safety expert on CBS News, said cell phones were still considered risky.
“Mobile phones are a real problem, not only because they could potentially create interference with navigational instruments, but because we know from the FCC that they could disrupt mobile phone relay antennas if used on board,” Rosenker said.
An industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to look into the issue recommended last month that the government allow wider use of personal electronic devices.
The pressure on the FAA has increased in recent years to ease restrictions on its use.
Critics such as Senator Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., argue that there is no valid security reason for these bans.
Restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce as the use of devices has become ubiquitous.
Some studies indicate that at least one-third of passengers forget to turn off their devices, or do so deliberately.
The FAA began limiting the use of electronic devices in 1996 following reports of interference with navigation and communication instruments when passengers were carrying FM radios, the high-tech gadget of the time.
The new airliners rely much more heavily on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed to withstand electronic interference and approved by the FAA.
Airlines have been allowing their passengers to use Wi-Fi at cruising altitudes for several years.
Aircraft modified to accommodate Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of airliners are expected to allow wider use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices generally emit radio transmissions of much lower power than previous generations of devices.
E-book readers, for example, emit only minimal transmissions when turning a page.
But transmissions are stronger when devices download or send data.
Amazon.com is among those pushing for a relaxation of restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers.
In 2011, company executives loaded an airliner with Kindle e-book readers and flew it to see if there were any problems, but there were none.
This has inspired members of the FAA Advisory Committee to have mixed feelings about whether or not the use of the devices poses a risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he thought interference from the aircraft was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members said there are only anecdotal reports from pilots that the devices can interfere with an aircraft's systems, and that most of them are very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to ask passengers to turn off their aircraft during instrument landings in low visibility conditions.
A travel industry group welcomed the changes, calling them common-sense arrangements for technology-enabled travelers.
“We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasurable passenger experience is not incompatible with safety,” said Roger Dow, president and director of the U.S. Travel Association.
A helicoptered bird from a platform in the North Sea has been released into the wild
A bird, helitrusted after being found exhausted on an oil rig in the North Sea, has been released into the wild.
The water rail was flown by helicopter to Aberdeen last month before it was put back on its feet by the Scottish SPCA at its rescue centre in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, director of the centre, said: “This rille of water was probably a wintering migrant who came from northern Europe and found himself caught in the middle of strong winds in the North Sea.”
It seems that the exhausted bird would have managed to find refuge on the oil platform.
He added: “He was unable to fly again, so we were contacted for help.”
The water rail was in good health when it was released.
Is the European elite ready to do business with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with a promise to bring businesses together and define what wealth and job creators want to see change in our relationship with the EU.
To do this, we commissioned the broadest and most comprehensive survey of UK business leaders and asked them what they thought of Britain, business and the EU.
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 business leaders, globally representative of all business sizes, sectors and regions in the UK.
The findings of the investigation will come as a surprise to many.
We found that the vast majority of companies are now looking to export outside Europe, focusing on countries that are modernising and developing while EU states are stagnating.
They want to see the government prioritize new trade ties with countries like China, India and Brazil rather than getting bogged down in the long and arduous process of reforming Europe’s institutional arcana.
When asked for their views on specific policy issues – ranging from monopoly regulation to product laws – the majority of business leaders believe that control over these key competencies should return to Westminster.
The single market has caused general discontent, with companies saying the cost of the Brussels settlement is disproportionate to the benefits of being part of the European trading area – 40% of large, traditionally most pro-European companies even agree.
Finally, and most importantly, our survey of business leaders revealed that a large majority wanted Britain to pursue initiatives to change the Treaty and develop a relationship with the EU based on trade and not politics.
This finding, found in all major groups and companies of all sizes, shows that the corporate world insists on a “significant change” that returns power to the UK.
The stakes are high – changing the treaty and better representing Britain’s interests would see a 16% swing in votes in favour of keeping the country in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should not hesitate for a moment: this survey shows that British companies support this plan to renegotiate the terms of Britain's accession to the EU.
It also shows that companies hope the renegotiation will be a significant shift in the current balance of power in favour of a return to UK hands.
It is possible, and increasingly necessary, to better represent the interests of British businesses, as the euro area embarks on the path of closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain and, as the findings of our survey show, for businesses this means refocusing on trade and a fundamental shift in Brussels’ regulatory approach.
The United States in the colors of Halloween
In the United States, President Obama has not departed from the Halloween tradition.
With his wife last night, he handed out treats to hundreds of children invited to the White House gardens in Washington.
Last year, the Halloween festivities on the east coast of the United States were canceled due to the passage of Hurricane Sandy.
This year, the celebrants have caught up.
In New York, thousands of costumed people participated in the parade organized in the neighborhood of "Greenwich village".
Everyone is excited, says one of the participants, Andrea.
I was finally able to put on the costume I had planned for last year.
“We’re having fun like crazy,” Rhonda adds.
People are happy.
That's a good kid, that's cool.
We really need this.
Halloween is a pagan holiday celebrated on the eve of All Saints, mainly in Anglo-Saxon countries.
Gazprom’s Alexei Miller says Bulgaria’s gas pipeline ushers in new gas era
The start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, said the director of Gazprom.
“A historic event took place today: Construction has begun on the Bulgarian part of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest large-scale project in Europe,” Alexei Miller, Gazprom’s chief executive, said in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of energy security for the entire European continent.
South Stream is expected to diversify Russia's export routes to Europe.
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its counterpart in Ukraine, through which most of the Russian gas destined for Europe passes, increases the level of risk compared to conventional routes, the director adds.
Miller added that the direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated “forever.”
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at a reduced rate as soon as the entire project is commissioned in 2015.
Gazprom said construction is expected to start in other downstream countries by the end of the year.
The pipeline was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
Pitcairn wants to create the largest marine reserve in the world
The island of Pitcairn wants to create the largest marine reserve in the world, announced Thursday the daily Les Nouvelles de Tahiti, taking a report from Radio Australia.
This island, east of the Gambier Archipelago (French Polynesia), is the last British territory in the South Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and Chile.
This territory measures 47 km2, if we count three other small nearby islands.
It has been British since its occupation in 1790 by the mutineers of the Bounty, an episode in the history of the English navy that gave rise to three Hollywood adaptations.
A few dozen inhabitants, mostly descendants of the Bounty mutineers, still live in Pitcairn, and their incomes depend on 95% of London's generosity.
The Island Council voted unanimously in favor of the creation of a marine reserve around the small archipelago, or 836,000 km2 which correspond to its exclusive economic zone.
A deputy mayor of the island went to London to ask Britain to validate this request.
Mike Warren, the mayor of Pitcairn, believes that the creation of such a protected area would be a first step towards more financial autonomy for his island.
The project must be accepted by the English Governor of Pitcairn, residing in New Zealand, and by the British Government.
The creation of such a marine reserve would allow the United Kingdom to protect these 836,000 km2, provided, however, that it has the means to monitor them, which is not the case.
There is no airport in Pitcairn, which makes it impossible to base one or more dedicated aircraft in the area, and there is no port to place military surveillance ships.
As for France, it must already conduct the very expensive aerial and maritime surveillance of the five million km2 of the EEZ of French Polynesia, neighboring Pitcairn.
The FAA is relaxing restrictions on the use of electronic gadgets on board aircraft – but it will still be prohibited from making calls on mobile phones.

Life in prison for former Chinese vice-governor
A former deputy governor of northeastern China's Jilin province was sentenced to life in prison on Friday for corruption.
Excluded from the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused of receiving more than 19 million yuan in bribes, Chinese official media reported.
Between 1995 and 2001, the deputy governor, who was also the chairman of Jilin Bank, a public institution, helped companies and officials obtain contracts, loans or promotions in exchange for money or gifts, Beijing's first intermediate court said on its microblog.
President Xi Jinping, who took office last March, has made the fight against corruption a national priority, saying the phenomenon poses a threat to the very existence of the Communist Party.
If the head of state has promised that justice would be as intractable with the powerful "tigers" as with the "flies" - the junior officials - only a handful of high-ranking officials have been convicted, among them former executives of the oil giant Petrochina.
The most spectacular recent case was that of the former CCP leader in Chongqing, Bo Xilai, who was sentenced to life in prison in September for corruption and abuse of power after targeting the highest positions within the state.
But the government has shown no intention of reforming the anti-corruption system by creating, for example, an independent party body.
Two YMCA employees charged with sexual assault following allegations made against Jonathan Lord at a Royal Commission hearing.
Two New South Wales YMCA employees have been charged with sexual assault of children following allegations made against Caringbah educator Jonathan Lord in 2011 at a hearing of the Royal Commission on Child Sexual Abuse.
But in its opening statement to the Commission, the YMCA said it “never had to address a child sexual assault issue within its organization.”
General Manager Phillip Hare was asked about two cases: one YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences and a physical education instructor at the YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of sexually assaulting children at the facility where he worked in 1991.
Mr. Hare told Gail Furness, counsel to the Commission, that he was aware of the first case but was not aware of the second.
He also admitted that the YMCA’s opening statement was inaccurate, noting, “External controls of the YMCA were conducted and indicated that the safety of children was a top priority for the organization.”
It was demonstrated before the Board that the YMCA had been informed that it had received the second-worst ratings out of four institutions in a Department of Education and Communities quality audit conducted in August of this year.
Mr. Hare, who began working at the YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that staff management was a failure with Lord's recruitment and that he failed to verify that employees knew they were required to report any violations of the child safety policy.
Earlier in the year, Lord was convicted of sexually assaulting twelve boys during the two years he worked at the YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum of six years in prison.
But Mr. Hare rejected the idea that the YMCA would have a cultural problem preventing staff from reporting Lord’s failings in child safety.
Staff members testified that they had observed some shortcomings, including the fact that Lord was alone with the children, kept them private, made them sit on his lap, told them that he loved them and let them play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was mentored by Lord and had requested child protection training because she was concerned about her behaviour, said she found Caringbah YMCA Child Services Manager Jacqui Barnat mentoring Lord "very intimidating and difficult to approach most of the time."
The Executive Director stated that he rejected staff testimony that they were reluctant to report these breaches to their line manager.
Instead, he said the friendly relations they had with Lord clouded their judgment, so they did not report his actions.
Mr. Hare stated that he had expressed his views to the New South Wales YMCA Board saying that, for the organization, the lesson from the “Jonathan Lord incident” should not be about “reporting” by staff, and the Board agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said the decision to have staff sign confidentiality agreements, shortly after the allegations were raised, was made by YMCA Director General for Children’s Services Liam Whitley.
He stated that this decision was intended to avoid any contamination of the evidence but that it was “excessive zeal” and had been poorly implemented.
The YMCA of New South Wales was not a safe organization for children at the time Jonathan Lord was employed there, i.e. between 2009 and 2011, said child sexual abuse expert Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University before the Commission.
He indicated that there were “serious problems” in the recruitment, control, initiation, training and supervision of staff.
The hearing was adjourned until December 20.
Tony Blair has said he would seize the opportunity to become prime minister again, but acknowledges that his return is unlikely.
In an interview last night marking the 5th anniversary of his departure at the end of his term, the 59-year-old made his views known on various national policies.
Since leaving in June 2007 after a decade at the helm, Mr Blair has largely avoided discussing British policy, limiting his comments to foreign affairs and his role as Quartet special envoy for the Middle East peace process.
Asked if he would like to return to the post of prime minister, Mr Blair was quoted by the London Evening Standard as saying: “Yes, of course, but it may well happen, so...”
When many equestrian event experts gathered in Cardiff to compete and win the Horse of the Year trophy, they knew the competition would be tough.
But no one expected three-year-old Fenton Kirkland to win.
Not yet in school and only a few months after making his first weapons, the toddler and his pony Shetland Toffee trotted during the three laps with great ease and won the first prize, leaving behind the other 30 adult competitors.
The two inseparable – who are the same size – were praised for presentation, attitude and style at the annual competition held at the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
Posing against men and women in elegant melon hats, he wore his flat cap a little on the side casually to parade his 2-year-old pony Toffee around the track.
Fenton was praised by the judges for his natural dressage qualities unusual for a child his age.
And Toffee received very good marks for his presentation and personality.
Fenton got Toffee as a gift for his 3rd birthday last March and has been training since with his Shetland pony every day.
His mother Donna, 30, said: “Fenton and Toffee make a great duo.”
They showed up against each other, but both took the gold cup and the rosette.
It was only the second time he had competed with Toffee and we were overjoyed that he won.
On the track, people who didn’t know him thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
This young boy, from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, in south Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been participating in equestrian competitions for more than 10 years.
Ms Howells said: "There was electricity in the air and everyone was cheering and cheering."
He ran the entire length of the track and even though he seemed to be very small, he did a wonderful job.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and the rural world and has two chickens he takes care of.
From the way he started, he will surely be participating in the Horse of the Year event soon – and I’m sure he will make a great performance.
A spokesperson for the annual equestrian event said: “Fenton is only 3 years old but he knows how to drive his pony.”
They make a good team.
The judges noted that Fenton and Toffee presented well and the way they marched on the track.
They are looking for effective teamwork between the pony and the trainer – Fenton and Toffee were the best on the track.
I'm sure his beautiful clothes helped Fenton, he really looked great.
A Chinese newspaper that issued a call “will be reshuffled”
A Chinese newspaper that has launched a front-page call for the release of a journalist accused of defamation is going to be reshuffled, a press regulator says.
The Guangzhou-based New Express has issued a rare public appeal for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to fabricate stories about a semi-public society.
Now, the New Express will undergo a “complete overhaul,” the regulator said.
The order of "reshuffle" emanates from the Guangdon administration for Press and Publishing, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express, owned by the Yangcheng Evening News group, published several erroneous articles about the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The New Express editorial staff was disorganized,” the regulator said in a statement.
He said he decided to "impose an administrative sanction on Chen Yongzhou by withdrawing his press card."
He also “ordered the Yangcheng Evening News Group to undertake a complete reshuffle of New Express, and recommended that it conduct an investigation into those responsible at New Express and immediately reshuffle the newspaper’s management team.”
Mr. Chen has written several articles for the New Express about alleged financial irregularities of a construction equipment manufacturer called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspaper twice published a front-page call for his release, writing that he supported his journalism.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on a public television channel where he admitted to publishing false stories for money.
“In this case, I have harmed Zoomlion as well as the media industry and its ability to gain public trust,” he told public broadcaster CCTV.
I did it mainly because I was chasing money and fame.
I realized my mistake.
Following Mr. Chen’s apology, New Express published its apologies on the front page, writing that it had not properly checked its articles.
Several prominent suspects have recently made televised confessions.
Experts say people are systematically forced to confess, despite a change in the law that was passed earlier this year prohibiting authorities from forcing anyone to incriminate themselves.
The aircraft carrier Charles-de-Gaulle in "unavailability"
In Toulon, the aircraft carrier is at bay.
The leak of radioactive steam detected at one of the two nuclear boilers of the Charles-de-Gaulle, in mid-October and while the ship was at sea, was "safe for sailors", but is not without consequences for the Navy.
The Royale has in fact just confirmed to us the "unavailability" of the ship until "mid-November", "the time to take the corrective measures that are necessary" on the reactor.
For its part, the company DCNS, a specialist in naval defense, ensures that its teams and those of Areva, dispatched to the Var for the occasion, "currently intervene on the aircraft carrier".
For them, it is a question, among other things, of changing a pump on the failing boiler room.
"Everything is being done so that the Charles-de-Gaulle can make its planned deployment at the end of 2013," DCNS said.
And the National Navy to certify that "it does not in any way call into question the program of activity of the ship" with nuclear propulsion.
Recall that the aircraft carrier Charles-de-Gaulle comes out of an intermediate maintenance period of six months.
He had sailed from Toulon in mid-October for training.
This, in particular, with a view to qualifying young fighter pilots.
A "small damage", limited to the containment space of the reactor, had then occurred on the flagship of the French fleet.
According to the Navy, the crew had not been exposed to possible radioactive contamination.
For more than a year, everywhere, I am able to see a strong dissatisfaction on the part of the people I meet: monstrous reassessment of their properties, deluge of taxes, cost of permits of all kinds, administrative costs to finish.
In short, unlimited siphoning of our pockets.
Millions of dollars wasted could be saved in order to allow a very respectful taxation of those who pay.
Any money forcibly taken from taxpayers diminishes their freedom of consumption and contributes to their impoverishment.
In Shawinigan, despite the closure of all major companies, there is no problem with lavish spending and maintenance of lame ducks: cultural center deficit, heavy subsidy to the City of Energy, etc.
If these facilities are not profitable, they should be sold to the private company or demolished.
It is also distressing to note the expropriation of several properties in order to accommodate a major industry that never came.
I do, however, give honourable mention to the transformation of the old Wabasso into a kind of industrial incubator, but at what cost to the taxpayers?
It is not at the public level to invest in such companies, but in the private sector based on consumer demand.
Citizens were pleased to learn that the lakes at La P<0xC3><0xAA>che and des Piles will continue to supply the city with drinking water.
As a result of the departure of all industries (large water consumers) and the great decline of the population, the use of water has decreased considerably throughout the territory.
Not to mention wasting it, the city will never run out of water and the strict regulations on its use could be greatly softened.
In short, it’s easy to achieve great things with other people’s money.
I would be ashamed to defend such a record.
With a gross debt of more than $200 million, this city is no longer even able to buy a pen without going through a loan settlement.
We've been run for over 40 years by ties with fine degrees for the most part and I don't think a sheep farmer would do any worse.
Discovery of a drug tunnel between the United States and Mexico with its own railway
One of the most sophisticated tunnels used for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems, has been discovered.
U.S. authorities described the 4-by-3 tunnel as one of the most sophisticated secret passageways they had ever seen.
The tunnel, zigzagging along a length equivalent to nearly six football fields long, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, to San Diego, USA.
The area is full of undefinable warehouses, making it easy to hide trucks loaded with drugs.
The tunnel was closed before the drugs came out unnoticed, authorities said.
Authorities seized 8.5 tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine after the tunnel was discovered, according to court records.
Three men who authorities said worked as drivers were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to sell.
They face a prison sentence ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment if convicted.
In Nogales, Arizona, traffickers operate vast underground drainage canals.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered following the harvesting of marijuana in central Mexico in October, posing a challenge to drug cartels who must quickly deliver their products to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found an approximately 700-yard passage equipped with railroad tracks that ran from the kitchen of a Tijuana home to two San Diego warehouses.
British police issue extradition warrant for Assange in the UK
British police today issued an extradition warrant for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who took refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and sought political asylum.
Scotland Yard said it had issued a “remission notice” against the 40-year-old Australian, asking him to report to a police station, adding that if he did not, he would be likely to be arrested.
Assange could be extradited to Sweden following allegations of sex crime, having exhausted all possible avenues under British law after the Supreme Court overturned his appeal against his extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would allow his transfer to the United States, he took refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on June 19, asking the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard has "issued a notice of surrender against a 40-year-old man who asks him to report to a police station on a date and time of his choosing," a spokesman said.
He continues to violate the conditions of his bail.
The Embassy declined to comment on the issuance of the notice by the police.
Assange fears being extradited from Sweden to the United States where he could be charged with espionage, after revealing more than 250,000 U.S. diplomatic cables on the WikiLeaks website fighting secret information.
How Biometrics Will Invade Our Lives
No more passwords to type to access his smartphone or pay for his purchases?
American, French or Japanese researchers predict a future where we will be recognized by the biometric sensors of phones and computers.
Bernard Didier, deputy general manager of Morpho, believes that "the century will be biometric".
Only biometrics will make it possible to ascertain the identity of a person carrying out transactions in a universe as transversal and transnational as the Internet.
Privacy-focused organizations confirm this craze for biometrics, but worry about it.
In 2011 and in France alone, the Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertés authorised 774 systems for the recognition of fingerprints, the shape of the hand or the venous network of the hand in companies, administrations, canteens...
“Everyone will soon be able to be identified, anywhere and anytime,” said Justin Brookman, head of consumer privacy at the Center for Democracy and Technology in Washington.
The reasons for such optimism, in some, and pessimism, in others?
Biometrics will be based on new techniques, which will make it possible to provide new services to citizens and consumers.
Today, in France, the most used biometric data are fingerprints, the contour of the hand and the venous network of the palm or fingers.
But each of these techniques has its limitations.
“For example, some people who work with concrete have very damaged fingers and their fingerprints are illegible,” says Philippe Robin, technical director of the identity field at Thales Communications & Security.
And the collection as well as the verification of the venous network and the contour of the hand suppose a voluntary and precise gesture of the people.
This is both a security - one cannot capture this data without their knowledge - and a drawback: the procedure sometimes has to be repeated and therefore takes time.
As a result, research has been carried out for about twenty years on other approaches, such as face or iris recognition (the colored part of the eye).
Thanks to the increase in the accuracy of the sensors and the computational capacity of the computers required for data analysis, these techniques become operational.
The accuracy of facial recognition has increased tenfold over the past five years, calculates Cyrille Bataller, Accenture’s director of R&D laboratories in Europe.
With our help, the UK and Holland have deployed automated border posts using facial recognition.
It is now possible to identify a moving face or iris.
“Today, we are doing research on voice recognition or how to walk using sound sensors, but we need a quiet environment,” said Sridhar Iyengar, director of security research at Intel Labs.
A unique and unfalsifiable marker, DNA also raises hopes and concerns.
"In the current state of knowledge, it can be considered the ultimate biometric data," confirms Sophie Vulliet-Tavernier, director of studies, innovation and foresight at the CNIL.
But DNA analysis is still very long and very expensive.
NEC offers police a suitcase costing 90,000 euros to analyze DNA samples at the scene of a crime and in one hour.
The uses of biometrics fall into two groups: identification (recognizing one person among others) and authentication (ensuring that the person is who they claim to be).
Until now, identification has concerned the issuance of identity papers: biometric elements (fingerprints, photos, irises) must be compared with the information that the State has on all citizens already registered.
This helps to ensure that a person does not attempt to impersonate someone else.
This comparison principle may have other applications.
NEC offers VIP recognition at the entrance of a hotel or store.
“We retrieve the images from the surveillance cameras and compare them to the photos of the celebrities that circulate freely on the Internet,” explains Dany Nassif, head of business development at NEC France, for biometric identification solutions.
Another use: take a picture of a quidam queuing in a store, track its progress through facial recognition and calculate the waiting time.
Authentication initially concerned physical access (borders, protected premises, canteens, etc.) or logical access (opening a computer).
More recently, presence control has been added.
"A biometric pointer avoids the phenomenon of the boyfriend pointing for another," justifies Cyrille Bataller, of Accenture.
But, increasingly, authentication will also concern transactions, in particular those carried out from devices connected to the Internet.
In Japan, it is already possible to withdraw money from certain distributors by entering your card and placing your hand on a biometric reader: this gesture replaces the keystroke of the secret code.
A similar technique is tested in Villeneuve-d'Ascq and Angoul<0xC3><0xAA>me by the company Natural Security in partnership with banks and retailers: when paying in store with his bank card, the customer does not type his code, but introduces his finger into a reader that scans the veins.
The experiment is scheduled to last six months.
If it is conclusive, biometric readers could soon arrive at French merchants.
Ways to reassure users
There are three ways to make biometrics appealing to the general public.
The first is to explain that it can save time.
"If, thanks to biometrics, a customer stays at the checkout thirty seconds less, it is appreciable," explains the director of a large supermarket.
The second is to offer personalized services: in a few years, a voice server will be able to recognize your voice and offer you customized options.
And, finally, reassure by highlighting the precautions taken to protect databases.
“The fingerprints are stored on a first server; the identities of people are in a second base: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure box, which locks if you try to move it,” says Philippe Robin, Thales.
But, in the absence of extensive studies, it is impossible to know if these speeches really convince users.
Privacy experts, on the other hand, continue to be concerned.
“Progress in facial recognition, the proliferation of surveillance cameras and the huge amount of photos available on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa, make me fear the worst: widespread surveillance,” predicts Andrew Patrick of the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada.
A driver driving at 210 km/h with a hot drink between his legs was hit with a <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 fine
A motorist was fined <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 for driving at 210 km/h with a hot drink balanced between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, of Tiptree, Essex, was spotted driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree on May 27.
When the police arrested him, they discovered the drink to take between his legs.
At the Colchester Court of First Instance, Howie admitted the offence of driving without due care and attention.
The seven points withdrawn on his licence led to a 6-month licence withdrawal.
Howie was also ordered to pay a <0xC2><0xA3>90 fee and a <0xC2><0xA3>100 victim surcharge.
A tax on foreign property owners to burst the London bubble
The Treasury has tentatively priced the capital gains tax measure but is awaiting a final decision from Mr. Osborne who, in Budget 2012, recorded a 7% stamp duty for properties costing more than <0xC2><0xA3>2 million and annual fees for buyers who choose to own properties as part of a corporation rather than on an individual basis.
The stamp duty already applies to residential properties in the boroughs of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, and amounts to <0xC2><0xA3>708m in fiscal year 2012/13, which exceeds the total amount for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North East, North West and Yorkshire and Humber combined.
Mr. Cook said, “Following the increase in stamp duty on high-value properties and the introduction of anti-avoidance law in this area, it is very difficult to argue that high-value properties are under-taxed regardless of the effects of the outdated housing tax system.”
“But this change could make foreign investors reluctant to buy properties in London or current owners reluctant to sell,” he added.
Prestigious real estate – the top 5 to 10 per cent of the property market’s highest prices – in the thriving area south-west of London stretching from Fulham to Wimbledon, grew a record 11.8 per cent over the past year.
Prices in central London show steady year-on-year growth of 5.6% but have been overshadowed by a growing "domestic market", with the south-west of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) experiencing a recovery, according to Savills' studies.
Scientists have just shed light on how the movements of a dog’s tail are linked to its mood.
Previous studies had found that happy dogs moved their tail more to the right (from the dog’s point of view), while nervous dogs moved it more to the left.
But now scientists say dogs can detect these subtle differences and respond to them.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: “Everyone knows that in humans, the left and right sides of the brain are involved differently in stimuli that arouse positive or negative emotions.”
Here we tried to see what it was like in other species.
He added that just as in humans, in dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for movement to the left and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played a different role in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to the messy tail movements of other dogs, the researchers followed animals watching movies featuring other dogs.
They measured the animals’ heart rate and analyzed their behavior.
It will surely not be long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes to one side and sometimes to the other.
Professor Vallortigara explained: “We presented dogs with films that featured other dogs – either a naturalistic version or a silhouette to avoid any other confounding factor – and we were able to tamper with the tail movement and present it as going more left or right.”
When the animals saw an expressionless dog wagging its tail to the right (from the point of view of the dog wagging its tail), they remained perfectly relaxed.
But when they spotted a tail veering mainly to the left (again from the point of view of the dog waving the tail), their heart rate accelerated and they looked anxious.
Professor Vallortigara said he did not think the dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these movements.
Rather, he thinks that dogs know from experience what movements they should or should not worry about.
“If you repeatedly meet other dogs and you notice that, most of the time, the movement of their tail to one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and that the right side leads to a less friendly attitude, you will react based on that experience.”
The researchers say the results could help owners, veterinarians and trainers better understand their animals’ emotions.
Dog behaviour expert John Bradshaw, a visiting professor at the University of Bristol's School of Veterinary Sciences, said this was not the first study to examine the importance of left and right in the canine species.
Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turned their heads left when they looked at an aggressive dog and right when they looked at a cheerful dog.
And in another scientific study conducted by the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: “Dogs were more likely to go towards a robot dog when its tail moved to the left rather than to the right, instead of becoming anxious – the opposite of what appears in the Italian study.”
He said the differences may come from the fact that the dogs that participated in the different studies did not fully consider the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study on how dogs react to real dogs could be useful, he explained.
“Although many elements, found in different mammals, indicate that the two sides of the brain are being used for different purposes, many details still need to be worked out – and dogs are no exception,” he said.
However, given the ease with which their behaviors can be recorded, it will surely not be long before we understand why their tail sometimes moves to one side and sometimes to the other.
Arctic Monkeys postpone Glasgow concert due to Alex Turner's illness
Rock band Arctic Monkeys has postponed a concert in Glasgow after its singer was diagnosed with laryngitis.
The Sheffield band was scheduled to perform Friday at The Hydro concert hall in the city centre.
However, his laryngitis forced singer Alex Turner to reschedule the show.
The announcement was made after the band was forced to similarly postpone a concert at Birmingham’s LG Arena on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys said: “Following the decision to postpone the concert to LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and after seeking medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys are also due to postpone the show to Glasgow Hydro on Friday 1 November.”
“Alex Turner suffers from laryngitis and regrets not being able to perform in concert.”
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will take place on November 20 and the one at the Glasgow Hydro will be held on November 21.
All tickets are valid for these concerts.
We would like to apologize to all ticket holders for any inconvenience caused.
Please contact customer service at the ticket office where you purchased your tickets for any further assistance.
Pope Francis to appoint first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals from the Catholic Church for the first time on Feb. 22, the Vatican announced Thursday.
The cardinals are the highest churchmen in the Catholic Church behind the pope, and those who elect him, so Francis will appoint his first group of men who will ultimately choose his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, as soon as a cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of a pope – this therefore falls to a group of 120 “cardinal electors”.
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said a meeting bringing together all existing cardinals would be held before the ceremony in which bishops will be elevated to the dignity of cardinal, known as the consistory.
“Pope Francis has decided to communicate his decision to convene the February consistory in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that by February, the number of cardinal electors will likely have decreased.
He said that a pope usually appoints as many cardinals as it takes for the number of cardinal electors to reach 120 and as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wants.
Next year’s consistory will be important because it will be the first since the election of Pope Francis in March this year, Valero said.
At the moment, there is a kind of tendency to favour Europe and Italy in particular.
“It will be interesting to see if the new pope appoints cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance,” he added.
Forty percent of Roman Catholics live in South America, but a small number of cardinals represent them.
The cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since Francis formed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world tasked with examining ways to reform the church.
In the past, the Pope made his own decisions.
“From now on, Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him,” Valero explained.
He added that it was “quite possible” for Francis to seek advice from the cardinals.
But we have never experienced such a situation – it is totally new.
Valero said the popes generally raised bishops representing large communities to the rank of cardinal, but that Francis was “full of surprises – so we don’t know who he will appoint.”
GM recalls some of its new pickups in the United States to repair the back of the seats
General Motors Co is recalling nearly 19,000 of its all-new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups to fix a problem with manually tilting backs, according to a statement Friday from the U.S. auto safety regulator.
On some pickups, the front seats could have a defect in the tilt mechanism.
As a result, the records do not meet federal vehicle safety standards for head restraints.
“If the vehicle is struck from behind, the head restraint may not properly protect passengers, increasing the risk of injury,” the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said in a statement.
The recalled models were built between August 1 and September 10.
The rollout of GM’s pickups began in June and represents the largest vehicle launch for the first U.S. automaker since its bankruptcy and restructuring in 2009.
GM informed truck owners of the defect during the first half of October.
NHTSA was unable to review the letter of information to owners due to the 16-day shutdown of government operations, which slowed vehicle sales growth in October.
Sales of Silverado and Sierra pickups, which have been redesigned for the 2014 model, grew about 20 percent in the first 10 months of the year, GM said Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickups and 16,503 Sierra pickups.
GM’s share price rose 1.4% to $37.47 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon.
A worker is buried under concrete blocks.
A construction worker died buried under dozens of concrete blocks Thursday morning in Montreal.
The incident occurred at approximately 11 a.m. on Marquette Street, near the intersection of Beaubien Street in the borough of Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie.
In all likelihood, work on the foundations had been going on there for some time.
A adjoining foundation wall had just been erected in the last few days.
The accident occurred when the victim had just arrived at the construction site to retrieve his tools.
I was driving by and I saw the wall collapse with a big cloud of smoke, said Sylvain Jean, who lives near the construction site.
I disembarked and went to remove the big bricks that covered it.
We only saw part of his back, it's so unfortunate.
According to the authorities, the victim is an elderly man in his 50s who worked for a formwork company.
Resuscitation maneuvers were attempted by the emergency services, but without success.
The man did not survive his serious injuries.
An inspector from the Commission de la santé et de la sécurité du travail was dispatched to the scene to investigate the circumstances surrounding the tragedy.
An Obama Voter's Cry of Despair
I voted twice for President Obama, believing in the possibility of change
He says Obama has made laudable efforts foiled by Republican Party obstructionism
Obstructionism does not excuse the difficulties of the Obamacare site, nor the drone attacks
Obama's 2008 campaign memoir is a sad reminder of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is a 2nd year medical student at Harvard Medical School.
I’m reading an awfully sad book these days.
This is a book that, I thought, would encourage me during the sluggishness of the second year of medicine and give me hope.
It's called "The Audacity to Win" and it's a memoir of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finished my patients’ medical reports in the evening and went to bed, this book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions of people and speeches could take your breath away.
The election ended in a landslide victory and news anchors took time to reflect on the historical nature of the moment.
My comrades wept with joy and my parents kept all the newspapers they found.
A young team of visionaries was advancing toward the White House and the nation was ready for change.
During Obama’s transition period before he took office in 2008, he held 82% favorable views.
And then I close the book.
Returning to the present is a difficult awakening, it is like coming out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these days full of optimism, they are like distant memories, a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past.
The change really happened in the years that followed the first time I voted.
It had nothing to do with what I had imagined.
I credit Obama with great accomplishments, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act to the departure of Iraq from our military, to the end of “neither seen nor known” and the assassination of Osama bin Laden.
In addition, I believe that partisan obstructionism has destroyed too many efforts to move our nation forward on immigration reforms, public health care, and the closure of Guantanamo, among other things.
But after repeatedly defending the Obama administration against my peers and colleagues, I can no longer provide an explanation.
I am on the verge of political despair.
The Republican obstruction cannot explain the wiretapping of foreign leaders, nor the attacks of innocent foreign children by drones.
It can’t explain the National Security Agency collecting data on Americans’ privacy, nor the indictment of whistleblowers who reveal the government’s wrongdoing.
It cannot justify the assassination of Anwar al-Awlaki, a US citizen, without trial, nor the evasion of public funding and the overspending allowed during presidential campaigns.
She cannot justify the findings of a report that says the White House’s efforts to silence the media are the “most aggressive ... since the Nixon administration.”
And, more recently, it cannot excuse the impossibility of designing a simple website for more than three years after the Affordable Care Act was ratified.
I don't know if that's what I was expecting.
If, at 18, I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict the political campaigns that preceded it.
Obviously, the electoral function is not predictable, because the opposition political party and events that happen by chance, such as the Newton massacre, influence our public conversation.
However, all of the examples I have listed above seem to be largely the administration's choice.
That's what bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confused and unrefined alternative that did not seem to determine his policies or positions.
I felt that Obama, elected to a second term free from the pressure of future elections, would keep the promises we have heard for so long.
Yet, while the index of favorable opinions has plunged below 45% this week, it is even more difficult to go back to the year 2008 through this book.
It makes me long for the many promises that have flown by.
This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Obama suffered huge losses to Clinton in the Pennsylvania primaries.
At a post-campaign meeting, he told his team that they needed to get back on track and stay true to their cause.
“I want us to focus on our talent,” he said.
We must remember who we are.
Here we are five years later, Mr. President, and I no longer agree with you.
The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nathaniel Morris.
On Friday, around 3 p.m., a violent collision between a motorcycle and a car occurred on rue de Retinne in Fléron.
The biker, Jonathan, 26, from Fléron, was not wearing a helmet.
Despite the rapid intervention of the rescue, he died during this frontal collision.
Clive Palmer claims that MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system.
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer argues that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system because his daughters could be pregnant and take advantage of it.
The mining tycoon, who is challenging the payment of a $6 million carbon tax, has made this argument in an attempt to dismiss questions about a possible conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial when deciding whether carbon and mining taxes should be removed.
But Mr. Palmer argued that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and indicated that Mr. Abbott's daughters were willing to personally benefit from these policies.
“He will have a significant conflict of interest when it comes to paying for parental leave because if one of his daughters is pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether or not she gets a leave of absence,” Palmer said.
Two months after his election, the Electoral Commission officially declared that Mr. Palmer won the Sunshine Coast seat in Fairfax by 53 votes, after recounting.
Mr. Palmer put forward the idea of a reshuffling of the voting system to speed up the process.
Tony Abbott's daughters, Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the vote is over?
“We need a better system,” he said.
Why can’t we have a system where you can go in, enter your details into a computer, vote immediately and have the result at 6:30 the next morning?
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to mark ballots.
Is it to be able to delete the result if someone disagrees?
Nowadays, having a pen of paper seems extraordinary.
The Electoral Commission has explored options for e-voting and has recently published a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, said his political project included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new duties “very seriously.”
The exercise of public functions is a matter of public service.
“We are not looking for reward, except the reward of history because we have to serve the community at a critical time,” he added.
A team of biologists led by the Wildlife Conservation Society of New York has identified a new species of humpback dolphin off the northern coast of Australia.
Thibaut Bouveroux, scientific mission officer at the Observatory for the Conservation and Study of Marine Animals and Environments (OCEAMM) returns to L'Express on this discovery and explains the long process of identifying new species.
Does the discovery of this new species of humpback dolphin surprise you?
This is good news, but I am not particularly surprised.
If in the past, species were described and identified on a morphological, anatomical and geographical basis, today, the development of new tools such as genetics allow us to improve our knowledge in the sciences of species classification.
Moreover, it is not impossible that these advances in genetics and molecular biology call into question the classification or membership of a species in a genus, a family, or even an order.
In the early 19th century, morphologists classified animals, based on morphological differences between species.
Today, some of these rankings are being challenged because of advances in genetics.
In the same way, two species very close morphologically have been distinguished thanks to genetics.
This is the case of the new species that has just been identified.
A decade ago, the scientific community recognized two species belonging to this subfamily: Pacific humpback dolphins and Atlantic humpback whales.
Recent analyses have identified four species.
Why is this a major discovery, as the Wildlife Conservation Society has stated?
From a conservation point of view, it is essential to know these genetic differences, in order to protect the species and therefore its genetic variability.
If this population had been known for a long time by researchers, they did not know that it was part of a new species, present only in this place.
Therefore, if a problem of mass mortality caused by a viral epidemic or accidental capture arises in the region, we could be dealing with the extinction of a species, rather than a local disappearance of a population of a species more widespread on Earth.
This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic.
A species is considered threatened or endangered depending on the number of individuals on Earth, that is, the stock, and the possibility that it has to recover from neighboring stocks.
As for the species Sousa chinensis, from which the population of the new species is derived, its stock has automatically become weaker, making it more vulnerable.
Why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammals?
Marine mammals are at the top of the food chain.
They live in homogeneous, open habitats, in which there are many genetic exchanges between populations and individuals.
This mixing of genes limits the creation of new species.
Conversely, more closed ecosystems promote genetic isolation, which can eventually lead to the creation of new species.
It should be noted that the marine environment is the least well known environment.
It is better to send robots to Mars than to know what lives in the Mariana Trench, just 11 kilometers from the surface of the sea.
We spend more money on the search for life on other planets than on marine research and it is high time that this changed.
RBS suspends two traders in foreign exchange market
Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange division, according to two sources close to the matter, showing once again that the global survey of regulators on suspicions of currency market manipulations is starting to bear fruit.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed they are cooperating with regulators as part of investigations into the world’s largest financial market, where $5.3 trillion is changing hands every day.
The two traders are the first RBS employees to be suspended as part of the widening investigation that echoes the Libor interbank rate manipulation scandal.
The bank, which declined to comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from regulators.
“The ongoing investigation into this matter is continuing and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators,” a bank representative said two weeks ago.
Last month, sources close to the case said RBS had forwarded files of emails and instant messages, sent to and from a former trader, to the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and was reportedly suspended from his position as European head of spot trading for currencies at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, European head of spot foreign exchange trading at Citi, was put on leave this week, while Matt Gardiner, senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been the subject of any charges.
Usher’s file included instant messages sent to and by bankers working at Barclays and Citigroup, sources close to the file said.
UBS said this week it had filed a lawsuit against some of its employees after Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating suspicions of foreign exchange market manipulation at a number of Swiss banks.
Around the world, at least six authorities – the European Commission, Finma, Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are examining allegations that bankers conspired to manipulate rates in the foreign exchange market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from regulators, sources close to the matter said.
Banks scrutinize instant messages and emails sent for years to find cases of wrongdoing.
News of these investigations has rattled traders in a sector that has been one of the biggest drivers of growth for investment bank trading units in recent years, but which has been called into question this year due to low currency volatility that limits opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the deal by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast, highly liquid foreign exchange market, but senior traders explain that this is not necessarily true.
A senior trader said that despite the high volume of daily foreign exchange transactions, the fragmentation of liquidity between exchange management platforms and the increasingly frequent use by banks of their own internal platforms “explains that it is possible to start having an impact on the market at little cost.”
The news came on the same day Credit Suisse said it had fired a trader working at its London Stock Exchange trading desk this week after he caused a $6 million loss late last year.
The bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with the regulators.
“We are convinced that the trader acted alone and that the deal was mastered,” said a representative of Credit Suisse.
The investigation into Mayor Rob Ford has been botched, a lawyer says
After police confirmed they had gotten their hands on a copy of the video that allegedly showed Rob Ford smoking crack cocaine, Clayton Ruby said he had never seen an investigation “that sloppy.”
Ruby told The Canadian Press that police had "ignored or downplayed" the evidence against the mayor.
On Thursday, police arrested Rob Ford's friend and occasional driver, Alexander Lisi, 35, and charged him with extortion in connection with the video.
Alexander Lisi, previously accused of drug trafficking, was in frequent contact with the mayor.
Police said they also observed the man delivering packages to Rob Ford, new court documents show.
Ruby called it "inexplicable" that police never searched Rob Ford's car or home, or tapped his phone, saying police chief Bill Blair knowingly chose not to take action against the mayor.
Under the law, police, having witnessed suspicious transactions in their own hands, could very well have intercepted Rob Ford’s vehicle, arrested the mayor, and conducted a search — even without a warrant.
It could also have requested an instant search warrant, if deemed necessary.
Police chief Mark Pugash did not comment, but spokesman Mark Pugash called Ruby's comments an "obvious and desperate attempt" to make his case to the media in a case that does not concern him in any way.
At a press conference on Thursday, Blair said there was nothing in the video that could constitute "reasonable grounds" that could lead to a criminal charge against the mayor.
European stock markets down at mid-session, except London
With the exception of London, Europe's major stock markets were down mid-day on Friday, weighed down by some disappointing corporate news, while Wall Street is expected to rise.
Investors remain cautious because they believe the U.S. Federal Reserve could end its quantitative easing policy sooner than expected.
Conversely, after the announcement of inflation at 0.7% for the entire euro area, the idea is spreading among market players that the European Central Bank (ECB) could ease its monetary policy.
Wall Street futures suggest that U.S. stocks will open higher after two consecutive sell-offs.
At the values, Renault (-4.63%) records the strongest decline of the CAC 40, lead by the warning on result of its partner Nissan Motor Friday.
Royal Bank of Scotland (-6.26%) is the worst performer in the EuroFirst300, having also reported lower results this morning and announced the creation of an in-house “bad bank” structure with 38 billion pounds of riskier assets.
For its part, Vodafone (+2.45%) remains at the top of the EuroFirst300 increases in reaction to press information that AT&T is considering a possible takeover.
In the foreign exchange market, speculation on the evolution of the ECB’s monetary policy is going well, as John Hardy, a strategist at Saxo Bank, testifies.
The ECB’s single mandate has always been about inflation, so Mario Draghi and his team have more reason to act at next week’s meeting.
We expect a strong potential for the euro to fall.
In this context, the euro continues its decline against the US currency and reached a two-week low at $1.3517.
These same conjectures support the euro area bond market in reverse.
Supreme Court Approves Obama's Health Care Reform Act
Big win for the Obama administration: The U.S. Supreme Court today declared that the health care reform law ratified by Obama is constitutional.
By 5 votes to 4, the judges validated the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – which requires citizens to take out health insurance by 2014, or face a fine – and declared it constitutional under the government’s taxing power.
The president of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, joined the four most liberal members of the Court, while Justices Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy disagreed.
The Court also validated the other 2,700-page sections of the Act and also found that the provision of the Health Care Reform Act, which states that the Medicaid eligibility threshold must be lowered or all federal funding for the program will be forfeited, was coercive under the Constitution.
The procedure to block the law was initiated by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
All of the major Republican presidential candidates running in the 2012 primaries, including nominee Mitt Romney, have fiercely opposed the law.
Vibrant tribute to veterans in Menton
In the heart of the Trabuquet cemetery, civil, religious and military authorities, as well as many patriotic associations, paid tribute this Friday afternoon to the soldiers and dead of all wars.
Sheaves were deposited in two of the three military squares of the cemetery by the deputy-mayor Jean-Claude Guibal and various personalities.
Israeli-Palestinian standoff at Gaza border
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers wounded Thursday evening in a violent clash on the Gaza-Israel border, the most serious incident in the Palestinian territory in a year.
The Gaza Strip’s only power plant shut down on Friday after its fuel stocks ran out, the Palestinian enclave’s Energy Authority said.
A local commander of the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, Khaled Abu Bakr, and another Hamas military branch official, Rabieh Barikeh, were killed by tank shelling during an Israeli army incursion east of Khan Younes in the southern Gaza Strip, according to local medical sources.
Two other local Al-Qassam Brigades officials, Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Daoud, were killed when an Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same area.
Their bodies were later discovered.
According to Palestinian security sources, the four fighters were conducting a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian enclave and Israel.
An attack on a tunnel dug by Palestinians
According to the same sources and witnesses, an Israeli tank and an armored bulldozer made a 100-meter incursion into the territory before withdrawing.
The clash lasted half an hour, according to witnesses.
In a statement, a Hamas spokesman, Sami Abu Zuhri, paid tribute to the four "heroes" and said Israeli soldiers were killed in the confrontation.
Hamas congratulates the heroes of Al-Qassam who fell while defending the territory during an incursion of the Zionist occupier in Khan Yunis.
Several enemies were killed and wounded during the operation.
“Hamas assures that Gaza will be a hell for the occupier,” the spokesman threatened.
For its part, the Israeli army said the target of its operation was initially a section of a large tunnel dug into Israeli territory from the Palestinian enclave, discovered on October 7 and intended, according to the army, for "terrorist activities".
Hamas has claimed the use of tunnels to fight Israel, saying the aim was to abduct Israeli soldiers and exchange them for Palestinian prisoners.
The operation was aimed at preventing future terrorist attacks using the tunnel, an Israeli military statement said.
During the operation, Hamas unleashed an explosive device targeting IDF (Israeli army) forces and wounded 5 soldiers.
Israeli attack in northern Syria
"This mission was imperative because of the risk of using the terror tunnel for attacks against Israeli civilians," army spokesman Peter Lerner said.
In addition, Israel struck an air base in northwestern Syria, targeting a shipment of missiles aimed at the Lebanese Shiite movement Hezbollah, the Al-Arabiya satellite channel reported Thursday, October 31.
A U.S. official confirmed an "Israeli strike" but gave no details on the target.
"In the past, the targets have been missiles transferred to Hezbollah," he said.
Israeli government officials have refused to confirm any reports of such an attack.
Citing "exclusive sources" it did not name, the Saudi-owned chain said the "bombing targeted a cargo of surface-to-air missiles that was destined for Hezbollah in Lebanon," referring to the powerful Lebanese Shiite movement fighting rebels alongside Syrian forces.
Earlier, a Syrian NGO, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, reported several explosions heard Wednesday at dawn at an air defense base in Sonar Jablé, near Latakia, on the Syrian coast.
The organization, which relied on a network of activists and medical sources, had not been able to identify the source of the explosions.
Back in black and white for Marie Chouinard, who presents at Danse Danse her two new group choreographies: the first inspired by the inks and poems of Henri Michaux, the second inspired by the famous piano solos Gymnopédies of Satie.
An evening that allows you to see the whole prism of Chouinard, from art to tics and from ink black to white.
A white screen serves as a background wall.
On the carpet, as white as it is, in the immense space that is the Thé<0xC3><0xA2>tre Maisonneuve, he steps forward, in profile, thin as a line and dressed in black, a body.
On the screen, an ink of Henri Michaux is projected.
The body, simple line, takes its form.
And this shape will be that of the whole piece: a thread of physical imitations of the drawings.
The dancers, entirely dressed in black, only hands and face uncovered, wait on each side of the playing area, rush when the next spelling appears, embody it, run out.
This black and white game by Henri Michaux is done in a solo relay, in a group in unison (a mass that makes a solo), in a large group of twelve solos where each one executes its sign.
One thinks of "Gloire du matin", where, in solo, Chouinard performed a series of choreographic tasks written on cartels, posed in line at the front-stage.
It's the same principle, giant PowerPoint version.
Here the music is loud, percussion and electric guitars.
The energy is high, the pace is always fast.
There will be breakage when Carol Prieur will take refuge under the dance carpet, to deliver, microphone in hand, without sobriety or restraint, a part of Michaux’s poem, monotonous and monotonous in the auction, and will continue dancing.
And the music to go back, and the sequence to resume.
This sound and energetic discharge, long, if possible, ends up deafening and numbing.
As does the regularity of the visual rhythm.
There are some beautiful flashes - image-making has always been a force at Chouinard - like those hairs that ruffle or those black fabrics that stretch the lines.
But the choreographic approach lacks composition.
One has the impression that the choreographer, instead of going to meet Michaux's work, has imposed herself, with her tics.
The result: the bodies appear flat in front of the drawings.
Michaux’s inks, like Gestalt forms, open up a wider and more playful imagination than dance, more porous.
Only the end, in negative, with its dancers chopped by a stroboscopic light and white signs in a suddenly black theater, touches the magic.
The public loved it, the welcome was warm.
The Gymnopédies, after the intermission, is richer.
The stage is partly draped in grey, the dancers and a piano are covered with fabrics, like furniture in an abandoned house.
At the piano, dancers take turns playing the scores.
Their awkwardness in music, touching, give a real fragility.
On stage, pass couples, in love duets, very sensual, even erotic.
Group work, small transition solos, moving ensembles, choirs, writing is less binary.
Buffoons appear, also familiar to Chouinard, sporting red noses, in highly polarized male-female love parades.
Loves are carnageous, fugitives or gamblers.
Gesture, laughter and small cries beautifully transpose the archaic, grace and ridicule of coited bodies, beings that merge.
But the piece takes its real flight after salvation.
A clown returns to the stage when the audience leaves.
There, everything becomes permissible: the fourth wall falls, the explored universes are superimposed, the cabotin dancers descend among the spectators, gloss, smoke, short circuit, play codes of applause, stretch the sauce in a cleverly calculated disorder that remains sensual.
Joy and madness perspire, and it's Chouinard's art, there, to contaminate the public.
Google, Samsung and Huawei face lawsuit over Nortel patents
The group that owns thousands of former Nortel patents began an avalanche of patent lawsuits on Thursday against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, the company it coiffed at the post during the patent auction that took place after Nortel's bankruptcy.
Rockstar, the consortium that acquired the $4.5 billion Nortel patents, has filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies in the U.S. Court of Assizes in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
The patents contain technologies that allow an ad to be displayed in connection with Internet search terms, the lawsuit’s findings said, which is Google’s core business.
It was not possible to reach representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC make phones that run on Google’s Android operating system, which is fiercely competing with Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial bid of $900 million for Nortel’s patents.
Google has increased its offer several times, finally offering $ 4.4 billion.
After losing the Nortel patents to Rockstar, Google subsequently acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a market based in part on Motorola's patent library.
“Despite having failed in its attempt to acquire the patents at issue during the auction, Google has violated and continues to violate those patents,” the suit said.
Rockstar is seeking higher damages against Google because it claims Google’s patent infringement is stubborn, according to the plaintiff.
Explosion of a house in Gesves: a defective water heater at the origin of the explosion
The grandmother allegedly lit a cigarette during a gas leak.
The explosion of a house in Gesves, which caused two serious injuries Friday morning, a 52-year-old grandmother and her 5-year-old grandson, is due to a leak of gas from a defective water heater, said Friday night the substitute of the prosecutor of the King.
The expert dispatched to the scene by the prosecutor's office ensures that the origin of the explosion is purely accidental.
The grandmother lit a cigarette while there was a leak and a buildup of gas.
The lives of the two victims are still at stake.
The grandmother was thrown by the explosion and is severely burned.
The little boy, who was staying with his grandfather and his companion, was by his side and was slightly burned.
"The two victims were intubated and long conditioned on the spot before being taken to the CHU of Li<0xC3><0xA8>ge, she in a helicopter, him in an ambulance," said mayor José Paulet, who descended on the scene.
Traumatized, the grandfather was upstairs at the time of the explosion.
Safe and sound, he was able to reach the ground floor by the stairs remained intact while the back wall of the house was totally destroyed.
The grandfather and the tenant of the neighboring house, weakened by the explosion, were relocated by the president of the CPAS.
The firefighters of Andenne and Namur and the Arches police intervened.
The Civil Protection of Crisnée has stabilized both buildings.
Egypt asks first freely elected president to take oath
Mohamed Morsi took the oath of office, but his day of triumph is unlikely to mark the end of political conflict in Egypt.
Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a “new Egypt” when he took the oath of office, becoming the first freely elected president and succeeding Hosni Mubarak who was ousted from power 16 months earlier.
During his inauguration before the High Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and the fifth head of state of Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy 60 years ago.
He was sworn in before the 18 black-robed judges of the court whose building on the banks of the Nile was built to resemble an Egyptian temple.
“We are longing for a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic,” Morsi said at a ceremony broadcast live on state television.
“Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,” said Morsi, a 60-year-old U.S.-trained engineer from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group seen for more than 84 years since its formation as an illegal organization and harshly repressed by successive governments.
Hundreds of soldiers and police were guarding the building when Morsi arrived shortly after 11 a.m. local time, followed by a small convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered in front of the court to cheer the new president and, distancing themselves from the presidential pomp of the Mubarak years, traffic was only briefly interrupted to allow his convoy to pass through the busy streets connecting the city center to the southern suburbs.
Considered the uncharismatic “rescue wheel” of the Muslim Brotherhood, his personal prestige has strengthened considerably since his victory and his speech on Friday in which he tried to present himself as the candidate not only of Islamists but of all those who want to finish the work begun during the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian president Mubarak.
“Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,” said Mohamed Morsi, wearing a blue suit and red tie, addressing the judges in the paneled room where he was sworn in.
Morsi later went to Cairo University where he delivered his inaugural address.
He was officially greeted by a military brass band that played the national anthem as he stood guard.
Marshal Hussein Tantaoui attended the ceremony.
Upon his arrival, he was greeted by the chant "The people and the army, hand in hand..." sung by thousands of people gathered in the great amphitheater of the university.
Founded in 1908 and a former bastion of secular education, Cairo University later became a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, the birthplace of the uprising that ended Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year, and vowed to reclaim presidential powers from the military council that replaced the ousted former president.
But by agreeing to take an official oath before the Court, rather than before Parliament as is customary, he bows to the will of the army by showing that the struggle for power is not over.
Morsi’s speech in Tahrir Square was accompanied by spectacular populist gestures.
The US shutdown has slowed the rise of the car market
The 16-day shutdown of most federal administrations weighed on U.S. car sales growth in October, according to figures released Friday by automakers, with five of the top six performing below expectations.
The three major Detroit automakers posted double-digit growth compared to October 2012, but only General Motors did better than expected.
Analysts had expected an average of 15.4 million annualized, seasonally adjusted sales, but the market was estimated at 15.3 million by Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas.
In a note to customers of the bank, he believes that this slight brake is explained first of all by "the government shutdown and its impact on consumer sentiment during the first fortnight of the month".
GM, however, reported an increase of nearly 16 percent in sales last month to 226,402 vehicles, compared to 211,563 expected by the consensus.
The four brands of the group have seen their commercial performance improve compared to October 2012.
Ford, which continues to benefit among other things from the success of its pickups, saw its sales increase by 14% year-on-year to 191,985 vehicles, while the consensus expected 194,301.
Fiat-controlled Chrysler announced an 11 percent increase in sales to 140,083 vehicles, compared with 143,536 expected.
Toyota and Nissan also posted below-consensus sales, despite year-on-year increases of 8.8% and 14.2% respectively.
On the New York Stock Exchange, GM was up 1.4% at 16:35 GMT while Ford was down 1.1%.
Renault hit by Nissan's warning
Renault on Friday posted the biggest drop in the SBF 120 index in Paris after its partner Nissan Motor said it had cut its annual net profit forecast by nearly 20 percent, traders reported.
Nissan, which had to carry out such a review, also announced a reshuffle of its management.
Several traders reported that Renault stock was affected this morning by the "warning".
“This is clearly Nissan’s profit warning,” said a trading official at a Paris broker.
As part of the Renault-Nissan alliance, Renault holds 43.4% of Nissan's capital and the Japanese manufacturer 15% of the French, according to data from Nissan's website.
Greece: Two Killed in Shooting Near Neo-Nazi Party Building
Two people were killed and another was seriously injured on Friday night by gunfire from two people who were on a motorbike passing a local neo-Nazi party Golden Dawn in the western suburbs of Athens, a police source said.
The police were not yet in a position to provide information on the identity of the victims and their possible political affiliation.
Some Greek media reported that members of Golden Dawn had claimed that the victims were guards at their premises.
The injured person was immediately hospitalized, according to the same source.
Police officers of the anti-terrorist service rushed to the central avenue of the suburb Neo Iraklio, where the incident took place and cordoned off the neighborhood.
The incident comes a few weeks after the indictment of six Golden Dawn MPs, including the leader and founder of the party, for participation in "a criminal organization" as part of an offensive against the party launched after the death of an anti-fascist musician by one of its members.
Scott Brown's appeal dismissed
Celtic captain Scott Brown has had his appeal rejected and will be suspended for his club's next two Champions League matches against Ajax and AC Milan.
Expelled against Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a for directing a blow to Neymar, the Scottish midfielder saw his suspension extended to three meetings by UEFA.
In a statement, the club said it was "very disappointed" and that its appeal was fully justified.
Nearly 50,000 homes are without electricity across the province shortly after noon on Friday, due to high winds affecting many areas along the St. Lawrence River.
The most affected sectors are the Laurentians with 15,042 subscribers plunged into darkness, Montérégie with 13,464 and the Outaouais with 8642.
The greater Montreal area is also experiencing its share of outages with nearly 7,000 private homes in the metropolis and Laval.
Did you think that travel agencies belonged to the past because of the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to be reversing the trend.
The company has revised its net profit forecast upwards and expects record results from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The travel agency now expects to make an underlying profit for the full year between $325 million and $340 million before tax, compared to a previous forecast of $305 million to $315 million.
If current forecasts are met, this will represent 12 to 17% growth from the record profit of $290.4 million in 2011/12.
Chief Executive Graham Turner said Flight Centre had achieved 8% profit in the first half and the second half had started strong, particularly with respect to non-business travel to Australia and the UK.
“Since the beginning of the year, the 10 countries in which we are present are profitable, and several of them are on track to achieve record results over the entire year before interest and taxes deduction,” he said.
This concerns Australia and the United Kingdom, which are generally the countries that generate the largest profits.
In Australia, the leisure travel sector rebounded in the second half of the year, offsetting a slight decline in the domestic business travel market.
Similarly, in the United Kingdom, the leisure travel sector at Flight Centre performed well, while business customers spent less.
Its U.S. subsidiary recovered its losses in the first half of the year as seasonal demand was lower and it was expected to make a profit for the full year for the third consecutive year.
Flight Centre shares rose 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Unknown gunmen shoot at hotel near Cairo pyramids
Unknown hooded gunmen opened fire on Friday on a hotel near the Cairo pyramids in Egypt without causing casualties, the result of an apparent dispute with dismissed employees.
The assailants fled, said Interior Ministry spokesman General Abdel Latif.
The attack comes as Egypt has received almost no tourists since the army ousted Islamist President Mohamed Morsi in early July and bloodily represses protests by his supporters.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
As part of the English Literature course, students will be required to study at least one piece of Shakespeare, a 19th century novel, a romantic poem and a work of contemporary British fiction from 1914 to the present day.
The review will also present "new texts" to encourage more diverse reading.
A course combining English literature and language will be deleted.
Starting in 2015, students will be required to pass an independent language GCSE, and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate qualification in English Literature.
The Ministry of Education is due to publish its new English and math programs tomorrow – the first subjects to undergo a radical overhaul.
It will make changes in other core subjects next year.
In addition, Ofqual, the examinations regulator, will unveil a redesign of the structure of the GCSE, with a new rating system and fewer courses.
Speaking over the summer, Michael Gove, Minister of Education, said there was "wide consensus on the need to reform our testing system to restore public confidence", insisting that the GCSEs would be "more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous".
Studies show that English schools spend less time on math (116 hours per year, or 3 hours per week during the school year) than most other countries.
In comparison, Australian schools offer an average of 143 hours per year, and students in Singapore do about 138 hours.
While there is no formal obligation to devote more hours of time to math, sources close to the coalition government have indicated that the GCSE’s in-depth maths – as well as the greater emphasis placed on subjects listed in international rankings – would likely encourage schools to provide more hours of classes.
The program will focus more on "real-world problems," including financial mathematics.
This judgment means that a law passed in July in this state that largely calls into question the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.
An octogenarian welcomes children with a muy rifle for Halloween
Minors aged 9 and 13 went door to door asking for candy on Halloween night.
One of the residents of the Muy district visited by the children opened the door holding his hunting rifle.
The 86-year-old told police he was scared.
His gun was seized.
Former Gestapo chief buried in Jewish cemetery
M<0xC3><0xBC>ller, who disappeared at the end of World War II without a trace, was in fact buried in a mass grave in a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, says the head of the German Resistance Memorial, Professor Johannes Tuchel, in Bild.
M<0xC3><0xBC>ller did not survive the end of the war.
"His body was buried in 1945 in a mass grave in the Jewish cemetery of Berlin-Mitte," he told the daily newspaper in large print, based on archival documents.
This revelation, 68 years after the end of the Nazi regime of Adolf Hitler, would answer one of the great enigmas of the Post-War period.
The German secret service, the BND, said that during the summer of 1949, M<0xC3><0xBC>ller was in Karlovy Vary, then in Czechoslovakia, according to a document obtained by Bild.
The Secret Service was completely wrong.
"From August 1945, M<0xC3><0xBC>ller's body was found in a temporary grave near the former Reich Aviation Ministry by a commando," Tuchel said.
He was wearing a "general's uniform".
“In the left inner pocket were his service records with a photo,” he continued.
Bild also publishes a document from the district mayor of Berlin's Mitte district stating that he was buried in the Jewish cemetery in the district.
The president of the Central Council of the Jews of Germany, Dieter Graumann, said he was shocked by the revelation.
For one of the most brutal Nazi sadists to be buried in a Jewish cemetery is an enormity of bad taste.
"The memory of the victims is rudely trampled on," he said in the newspaper.
Heinrich M<0xC3><0xBC>ller is one of the important figures of the Third Reich who were never captured.
He participated in the Wannsee Conference in January 1942, which decided on the "final solution" and had under his orders Adolf Eichmann, responsible for the "logistics" of the extermination of the Jews, sentenced to death and executed in Israel in 1962.

Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free health care in Cameroon’s villages
Dr. Bwelle and his team spend nearly every weekend seeing hundreds of patients.
There are not many doctors in this West African country, barely 1 per 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or via your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of CNN’s 10 Heroes of the Year for 2013.
You can vote for him, or one of the other 10 heroes, to be voted “CNN Hero of the Year.”
This person will receive $250,000 to continue their extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his ailing father alternate between periods of awareness and unconsciousness and went to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only one broken arm, but he contracted an infection that spread to his brain, creating a hematoma that he would carry with him for the rest of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” said Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken him abroad if we had had enough money.
Instead, Dr. Bwelle spent years accompanying his father to crowded clinics and hospitals, so he could get any treatment he could get.
“It’s not easy,” adds Bwelle.
You can leave the house at 5:00, rush to the hospital to be the first, and you're not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
People can die because they wait too long.
The situation has not changed much since the death of Dr. Bwelle's father in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor per 5,000 inhabitants, according to the World Health Organization.
For comparison, the ratio in the United States is 1 doctor per 413 inhabitants.
And even if they could see a doctor, many Cameroonians would not be able to afford the consultation.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and almost three-quarters of the country’s health spending is in the private sector.
“The only problem they have is poverty,” explained Dr. Bwelle.
And because of poverty, they cannot enjoy life.
After seeing his father and so many of his countrymen suffer, Dr. Bwelle was determined to try to change the course of things.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers have performed more than 700 surgical procedures for free over the past year.
He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon at Yaoundé Central Hospital.
And he has created a non-profit humanitarian association, ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas on weekends to provide free health care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, with about thirty people, they cram into vans after fixing medical equipment on the roof and cross difficult terrain to get to the villages that need help the most.
Luck doesn’t always follow them.
Many times they had to push the vehicles to cross rivers or muddy tracks.
But when they arrive, they are welcomed as heroes: the community throws a party, sings and dances and offers them the best housing available.
In these villages, free health care is a good reason to party, and Dr. Bwelle – with his big smile and boundless energy – is more than happy to join the festivities.
The next morning, the team began receiving hundreds of patients.
“We get 500 people each visit,” Bwelle said.
They sometimes live 60 km from the village, and they come on foot.
In this itinerant hospital, various health care is provided.
Many people are receiving treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive crutches, a collected pair of glasses or a free birth certificate – a document needed to go to school, but many poor families simply can’t afford to buy it.
In the evening, the team performs simple surgical procedures under local anesthesia.
The operations are usually performed in a school, a town hall or a house; after the intervention, the patient gets up and goes to the recovery room to give his place to the next person.
Through the lighting of the generator, the operating room and the sterilization of the equipment, Dr. Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of Sunday morning.
It’s a grueling pace, but village musicians generally help the team stay motivated.
“They beat drums all night to keep us awake so we can keep working,” Bwelle said.
On Sunday, the team returns to the city, tired but proud of the work they have done.
The group, made up of Cameroonian doctors and medical students, has performed 700 surgical procedures for free over the past year, and they know that their presence can make all the difference for those they help.
One man explained that the free operation he had undergone to treat a hernia would allow him to work again.
“It’s going to change my future and that of my family,” the man said.
In addition to maintaining this itinerant hospital and working as a surgeon in the hospital, Dr. Bwelle also works at night in private medical offices around Yaoundé.
It is this second job, he explains, which finances 60% of his association; the rest is covered by private donations.
“I don’t know when he’s sleeping,” said Katie O’Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and a volunteer in Dr. Bwelle’s group.
He is still in the hospital or trying to find money for his association so he can run these campaigns.
For medical students and nursing students like Katie O'Malley, who come from the U.S. and Europe to join Mr. Bwelle on his missions, it's a field learning opportunity they don't have at home.
"We were able to participate in operations to help with blood smearing or to get the instruments to Dr. Bwelle," explained Ms. O'Malley.
It’s not something you get to do in America when you’re a second-year medical student.
Student volunteers generally pay for their trip to Cameroon, and often arrive with medical equipment collected.
But once in Yaoundé, their boarding, transportation and education are taken care of by Dr. Bwelle.
“He’s a hero, there’s no doubt about it,” Katie O’Malley said.
He gives his life for this association, and his desire to help the Cameroonian people is not nearly extinct.
For Dr. Bwelle, the relatively constant workload is not a challenge.
Helping others live happily by keeping the promise he made to his father is something that brings him immense joy.
“I’m so happy when I do this job,” Bwelle added.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
Making people laugh and relieving pain are the reasons that drive me to do this.

The Two Frances by Pierre Nora
Perplexed, academics have long struggled to define and locate Pierre Nora.
Teacher in amphitheaters and classrooms?
No doubt, but pointing out his weakness for the cross paths, Sciences-Po, the Hautes Etudes.
Arbitrator of the works of others in his office on Gaston-Gallimard Street?
Indeed, but ignoring the hidden work and the underground writing of the editor.
Heir to the chair occupied by Fontenelle at the Académie fran<0xC3><0xA7>aise?
Of course, but knowing that such a coronation cannot replace the true holy oil, that of the thesis, of which it happened.
They readily recognized him as a great awakener, animator and unifier of their work, but pointing out that he showed little inclination to produce it himself.
To this uncertain image the monument of the "Places of Memory", to which he attached his name, also contributed.
Bad languages have seen a gigantic flea market, presented by an intelligent commentator, with a keen eye and weighted with scholarship, but incurably dilettante.
The two books published by Nora almost two years ago have already established that the one who passed for not writing had a lot and well written.
This book should definitely do it justice.
Yet we find, once again, the temptation of ubiquity, the intellectual vagrancy, the jubilation set to jump as if with feet joined from one subject to another.
But we quickly understand that the disparate objects gathered in this book with such a beautiful title bring the dealer back to one and the same passion: that of discovering the constitutive node of the French identity.
Why these dramatic calls for national unity?
Identity: This is an age-old concern.
Not long ago, we were collectively invited to give a definition of it.
But in the peremptory spirit of our leaders of that time, French identity was a timeless essence.
It was necessary only to deploy the accidents, and the case, Jacobinism obliges, was entrusted to the prefects and to the sub-prefects, authorized interpreters.
The one that Pierre Nora tracks is completely different.
He does not pose as the heir of an eternal franchise, he refuses the definition.
An analyst worried about a familiar strangeness, he wanders through a forest of symbols, stopped at every step by a rebus-shaped object, tormented by irritating questions.
Of which this one, which is born of the company itself: why, in a country so permanently settled in its borders, so anciently carpentry and solidly masonry, do we hear these dramatic calls for unity?
They are only so urgent, suggests Pierre Nora, to ward off the turmoil born of the discords of French history.
Franks and Gauls, Armagnacs and Burgundians, Catholics and Protestants: the forces of division here are very old.
And the most emblematic is obviously the one that splits national history in two.
Since the earthquake of the Revolution, the French have two histories and they have two nations, one monarchical, the other revolutionary.
The second wanted the death of the first, but without succeeding in denying it; on the contrary, anxious to rediscover its sacredness and all the more eager for unity and indivisibility as it had cut off the head of the one who was its obvious and powerful incarnation.
And, from there, an invincibly binary nation, divided between left and right, secularism and Catholicism, adoration and hatred of the revolution.
To make this singularity of French identity felt, nothing beats the four steps outside of France, so much so that Pierre Nora’s American escapade could well be the heart of his book.
Because America and France have both made a revolution, drafted a bill of rights, wanted to found a new society.
But the American Cousinship only highlights what is unique to us.
There, men who had left their Ancien Régime in England and no longer had to worry about it.
Here, men encumbered by an indigenous Ancien Régime, and all the more radical.
There was a consensual revolution when here she sowed drama and confit.
There are always honored founding fathers, and here revolutionary ancestors whose models are hard to make, and who have moreover killed each other.
There is an institutional constancy, and here a cascade of constitutions, as so many errors to catch up and attempts to resume.
The France that goes, the France that comes
There was, however, a time when the French believed they could sew the torn dress of their history, and defeat the curse of the number two.
To this Third Republic, central and creative moment, Pierre Nora showed much interest and even tenderness: saluting those who then worked to repair the revolutionary fracture, teaching schoolchildren everything that in ancient France obscurely prepared modern France and offering them a unified version of their history.
But this pacified identity has only been around for a while.
Here it is again under debate, shaken by a new type of immigration, threatened by the rise of demanding minorities, absorbed into the European space.
The book thus offers both the fascinating portrait of France as it goes and the circumspect sketch of France as it comes.
With, as a bonus, the portrait of the historian, who should reserve some surprises.
It turns out that the chimney was a housekeeper.
The man of multiple curiosities revolved, slightly obsessively, around the same idea.
The edge walker stood in the center of the center.
And the man who had deposited more than half a century ago a subject on the idea of nation, but had evaded the initiatory exercise of the thesis, confides to us, cum grano salis, that he will have finally done it.
Certainly in a less steep, more exploded and more subtle form.
But make no mistake about it, just as binding.
For much more than the imposed figure of the university curriculum, this thesis says the inner necessity of a life.
A former hostage in Lebanon: "The return is quite complex to manage"
Kidnapped in Beirut on 8 March 1986 with three members of his "Antenna 2" team who had come to film a Hezbollah demonstration, journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was released almost 21 months later, on 27 November 1987.
Retired since 2008, he participated in 2004 in the creation of the association for the defense of hostages "Hostages of the world", which he has chaired for several years.
Its main objective: to provide the opportunity for hostages to file a complaint and bring their hostage-takers before the International Criminal Court.
Detained for more than 1,000 days, the four hostages of AQIM (Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand and Marc Féret were released on Tuesday.
After medical examinations at the Val-de-Gr<0xC3><0xA2>ce military hospital on Wednesday afternoon, they have since been able to find their families.
And try, little by little, to resume the course of their lives.
"Le Nouvel Observateur" asked Jean-Louis Normandin, 62, former senior reporter, retired since 2008, president of the association "Hostages of the world".
From the evening of your release, you were on the set of 20h of "Antenne 2".
What are your memories of your release today?
Especially on the ground in Beirut.
When I am released, I find myself in the trunk of a car where I meet - without seeing him because it is dark - Roger Auque.
He says, "We're free," but I'm not sure, and he says we can still be killed.
We're very excited, but we're also very tense.
It is war, and those who lead us are also very tense.
They drop us off on the edge of a sidewalk.
There are Syrian soldiers.
We then arrive at the site of the Summerland Hotel where the press is present.
Frenchmen take us to the French embassy.
It's time for the first phone calls to parents, family, friends, the press...
I remember taking a bath for an hour.
And having dinner in a t-shirt at the French embassy.
I also remember a short night talking with Roger and Marchiani.
The tension is still there because we have no means to evacuate to Larnaca airport in Cyprus.
Arriving there by helicopter, we take a private plane that takes us back to France via Corfu and Solenzara, where Pasqua embarks.
How was your arrival on French soil?
We landed at Orly.
Chirac, Prime Minister, is here.
It's kind of brutal.
There's an incredible stampede.
And a lot of media.
When I left there were three TV channels.
I'm coming back and there's plenty of them.
The descent down the stairs of the plane, the reunion with my son and my parents, my friends, all this is extremely emotional.
Between the airport and my home, many motorcycles follow our car that Roussin drives.
The bikers take pictures and follow me to my house where I have to do a little police to prevent some of them from going up.
The media pressure is enormous.
It doesn't stop, we're in a good position to find out...
But the state of emotion and fatigue is such that it is difficult to see clearly.
We come out of a hole and all of a sudden we're in the spotlight.
It's a bit complicated, a bit violent, quite complex to manage.
But we did the hard part.
The same evening, I'm at 8 pm, the next day I'm also on TV.
Then begins a kind of rehabilitation to life, very slowly, for a month or two that is a bit like a vacation.
How did the medical examinations and DGSE debriefing go?
I had my first medical check-up in Corsica.
The rest was done in Val-de-Gr<0xC3><0xA2>ce the days following my return: radios, examinations of all kinds and meeting with a psychiatrist.
It is not a session that does everything but we know that we can count on him, remind him if necessary, that we are not left to ourselves.
It's part of the procedure.
I also met with the intelligence services.
They asked me about the hostage takers.
It made sense.
It didn't bother me.
How do you react today to the release of the four hostages in Niger?
I listen to what's being said.
In particular, the question of ransoms.
Some things annoy me, others less.
I try to put things between the questions about my past as a hostage and my hat as president of the association "Hostages of the world" which allows me to put distance, and I find it much more interesting to address.
I wonder, for example, about the definition of resilience.
Above all, I am fighting, with others, for the recognition of the legal status of the hostage.
I think there is a problem with semantics.
The taking of hostages must be described as a "political" hostage-taking - which is the case most of the time - and the hostages must be allowed access to justice, the right to file a complaint and the right to bring their hostage-takers before the International Criminal Court.
Today, once again, everyone is in compassion, in emotion, and rejoices in the release of these hostages.
But who is to say that these hostages might also have access to justice?
A court in The Hague is made for this.
Why don't we say to the hostage-takers, "You have flouted the rules of war, like those of all the Geneva conventions, we will bring you to justice"?
Yet it seems to me well-founded, legitimate, struck by common sense.
This message is heard, but not listened to, and it shocks me.
That's my main fight.
Egyptian Islamists take to the streets to denounce Morsi’s trial
Anger rages in the ranks of Egyptian Islamists.
Two days before the opening of the trial of ousted President Mohamed Morsi, they took to the streets.
A mobilization throughout Egypt to demand the restoration of the country’s first democratically elected president.
This is not a trial, this Muslim Brotherhood activist points out.
So far no lawyer has been able to meet with him and no volunteer has been able to take a copy of the case documents.
It's not a trial, it's a farce.
The trial of President Morsi is a false trial if a pro-Morsi revolts, it is he who is supposed to judge Sisi, not the other way around.
Morsi must try Sisi for the Rabaa massacres, the Nahda massacres, and the Republican Guard massacre.
Sisi is a liar and a traitor.
Clashes broke out in Alexandria, police used tear gas, 60 demonstrators were arrested.
On Monday, 20,000 police will be deployed in front of the Cairo Police Academy, where Mohamed Morsi will be tried.
Hagel accuses nine U.S. states of violating gay rights
Since the federal state has recognized same-sex marriage, “all military spouses are entitled to a Department of Defense identity card and the benefits that come with it,” the minister said in a speech to the Anti-Defamation League.
"But some states refuse to issue these cards to same-sex spouses in the facilities of the National Guard" located on their territory, he denounced, accusing these states of violating the federal law and the principle of equality.
Without these cards, these people cannot benefit from the many social or health services provided in these bases, or access their stores.
The Secretary of Defense said he had ordered the head of the National Guard, General Frank Grass, to ensure the implementation of federal law.
The slingshot of the nine states began with Texas refusing to implement these benefits on the settlements of the Texas National Guard, due to a conflict between the Texas law and the federal law on same-sex marriage.
It was joined in its refusal by Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia, according to a senior defense official.
The Pentagon estimates the population affected by the recognition of same-sex marriage to be about 5,600 active people, 17,000 including the National Guard, the reserve and pensioners.
Sixth edition of the Play Skateboard this Saturday in Hy<0xC3><0xA8>res
The sixth edition of the Play Skateboard takes place this Saturday, November 2 at the skate park in Hy<0xC3><0xA8>res.
Organized by the SK8 Unity section of the Bump association, the competition should bring together the best skaters in the region.
Registrations are taken on Saturday morning from 9 am and the qualifying phases will begin in the wake, at 10 am, before the final scheduled at 3 pm and the award ceremony at 4 pm.
The public will be able to admire the technical prowess of young people who, for some, already attend competitions at the highest level, like the young prodigy Lorenzo Palumbo.
At only 10 years old, he has already won his place at the European Championships in Copenhagen this year and he likes nothing more than to show off to competitors who surpass him by three heads.
Toronto mayor chases reporters who came to question him about a drug case
In Canada, the mayor of Toronto is suspected of taking drugs, according to several media reports.
A video released to the court seems to support these suspicions.
Rob Ford has always denied using crack cocaine, while acknowledging that he has a penchant for cannabis.
On Thursday, he drove several journalists from his property who had come to question him.
We also believe that sometimes images do not need explanation or commentary.
A case of rabies detected in a cat in Val-d'Oise
Authorities announced Thursday that a case of rabies had been detected in a kitten in the Val-d'Oise, obviously of foreign origin while France has been free of indigenous cases since 2001.
The kitten was found on October 25 in Argenteuil and he died on October 28.
The diagnosis of rabies was confirmed by the Pasteur Institute.
"An epidemiological investigation has been launched to identify and care for people who may have come into contact with this kitten between 8 October and 28 October inclusive," the ministry said in a statement.
"Five people who have been in contact with the kitten have already been identified" and received preventive treatment.
"In humans, the preventive treatment of human rabies, administered after contact with the carrier animal, but before the appearance of symptoms, is very effective," the statement said.
Departments are now calling people who have been bitten, scratched, scratched, or licked on a mucous membrane or skin injured by this kitten or whose animal has been in contact with this kitten between October 8 and 28 to contact 08.11.00.06.95 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. from November 1.
"France being free of rabies since 2001, this kitten or the mother was imported from another country, not unscathed," the statement said.
The Ministry of Agriculture specifies that the last "indigenous" case of rabies was recorded in December 1998 on a fox and that "France was officially declared free of this disease in November 2001 by the International Office of Epizootics (OIE)".
A case of rabies on a dog illegally imported from The Gambia was recorded in 2008.
"Rage is a deadly disease if not treated in time," the ministries said, and is transmissible for nearly 15 days before the first symptoms of the disease appear.
Obama backtracks on health care reform
Under a barrage of criticism, President Obama yesterday reneged on his often-repeated, unambiguous promise that “if you’re happy with your health care, you can keep it.”
After hundreds of thousands of people received termination notices from their providers, Republicans have criticized the president over the past few days accusing him of deceiving the American people.
Yesterday, Barack Obama adjusted his original promise.
“The vast majority of people who have health insurance that’s right for them can keep it,” he said in a speech in Boston.
Speaking of what he calls “a buzz in the news” about terminations, President Obama urged Americans who received these notices to seek new insurance in the market.
Most people will be able to get complete and better-suited health plans for the same price, or even for even less than expected.
“You will win,” he said.
The Administration announced that it should not be surprised if the 5% of the population who self-insured were forced to change plans because their coverage did not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
“Let me address these Americans directly: You deserve better,” Kathleen Sebelius said in her testimony before the Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch in October of the online marketplace had failed “regretfully.”
“I’m as frustrated and irritated as anyone,” she added.
I look forward to regaining your trust.
It was an exasperated Kathleen Sebelius who uttered this sentence, while she believed her microphone cut, addressing an assistant sitting behind her during yesterday’s Assembly session following a contentious exchange of views with Billy Long, the Republican representative from Missouri, about whether she should join Obamacare.
For more than three hours, Billy Long kept asking Sebelius why the “architect” of the Affordable Care Act hadn’t voluntarily given up government-sponsored insurance to get a plan through HealthCare.gov, which she now boasts to millions of Americans.

The lucky winner, Jake Vite Prekop, combined the colors of the car brand and the German flag, while integrating the notions of speed and heat at the level of the track.
Germany's Sebastian Vettel, the four-time Formula 1 world champion, set off for free practice at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on Friday with a special helmet designed by a 21-year-old Mexican fan.
Vettel chose from 1,500 drawings sent from around the world, in a competition launched by one of the sponsors, a car brand, of his team.
He was invited to follow the Abu Dhabi GP, with a friend, and can therefore see the German champion up close, on the track and in his stand.
Vettel was scheduled to wear the helmet on Friday and Saturday for testing.
It is likely that he will have another special helmet on Sunday, for the race, intended to mark his 4th consecutive world title.
A resident of Aubervilliers launches his Party of the suburbs
Make no mistake about it.
In the mind of Abdel-Malik Djermoune, its founder, the "Party of the Suburbs" is not only for the suburbanites.
I chose a map of France as a logo, he justifies.
When I speak of the suburbs, I am speaking to all those who are excluded from the great national family.
However, his project, presented Thursday at a press conference in his hometown of Aubervilliers, was born from the desire to better defend multiculturalism, this great cultural melting pot that characterizes above all the neighborhoods.
My first proposal is to create a ministry of multiculturalism, he says.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune, 50, territorial attaché, claims today as "100% apolitical" even if he has not always been neutral.
Militant in 2002 alongside Jean-Pierre Chevénement, he then supported locally Dominique de Villepin between 2010 and 2011.
I know that the values of equality that I advocate in my program are attached to the left, but if the people of the right are ready to support me, I will also listen to them.
It is only to the extremist parties that I do not speak.
In addition to multiculturalism, Abdel-Malik Djermoune has built his program -consultable on the Internet- from many themes supposed to speak to suburban residents and especially to young people: the right to vote for foreigners, the legalization of cannabis, the civil majority at 16, the rehabilitation of the function of guardian of buildings...
It remains to find candidates to form lists and defend his ideas on the political scene "For the municipal elections of 2014, it may be fair, he acknowledges."
It's a matter of time and money.
The Parti de la banlieue should still be represented in Aubervilliers through my candidacy and I hope also in other cities.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune says he already has seven list leaders in metropolitan France and Martinique.
"And the support emails I've received since yesterday are not all from the suburbs," he said.
John Kerry has admitted that U.S. spying “went too far inappropriately.”
Kerry said the U.S. defense posture toward its surveillance programs has been softened by admitting, unprecedentedly, that on several occasions, spying “went too far inappropriately.”
The Secretary of State also admitted that he, like Barack Obama, ruled on “autopilot” when a series of incendiary revelations by whistleblower Edward Snowden about NSA spying activities came to light.
The leaks have put the U.S. government at the center of a diplomatic storm with its allies.
Speaking at an intergovernmental conference in London via video link, Kerry said: "It is undeniable that the President, myself and other members of the government have become aware of certain things in autopilot mode because we had the possibility, from the Second World War and up to the difficult years of the Cold War and then of course 9/11."
He then became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. spying had gone beyond limits, but insisted that everyone’s rights had not been violated.
He said: “In some cases, it went too far inappropriately.”
And the President is committed to trying to clarify and make clear to people that he was now conducting a thorough review of these practices so that no one would feel cheated.
I assure you that innocent people will not be abused in this process.
Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force acting for good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added: “We live in a new world where people are ready to blow themselves up.”
There is a radical extremism in the world that is determined to try to kill people, blow them up and attack governments.
What if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they act?
We did prevent planes from falling, buildings from exploding and people from being murdered because we were able to learn the facts in advance.
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will travel to Europe to address concerns about the alleged U.S. spying case and convince Europeans of the need to continue joint counterterrorism efforts with the United States, the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he had spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about threats they had made about a possible withdrawal of anti-terrorist organizations because of the frustration with the National Security Agency's surveillance.
“It’s really important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans stand by us in mutual engagement in the fight against terrorism,” Murphy, a Democrat serving his first term and chairman of the U.S. Senate’s subcommittee on European Affairs, said in an interview from Washington.
And I’m going to go to Europe to make them understand that we must continue to work together to fight terrorism, despite the anger provoked by the NSA programs.
The press reports that the NSA has captured millions of communications in Europe, which has strained relations with some U.S. allies, however the agency’s director said this week that it was inaccurate and that it was a misunderstanding because it concerned metadata that NATO allies had collected and shared with the United States.
Other revelations included documents leaked by Snowden that the NSA had intercepted data and communications from German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s mobile phone and those of 34 other heads of state.
Intelligence Director James Clapper justified the spying by saying it was necessary and was a common practice on both sides.
In that tumultuous atmosphere, Murphy said his office is planning a congressional trip, which is expected to take place this year, and he hopes the delegation will include members from both parties and both houses.
The names of the other participating legislators are expected to be revealed in the coming days.
He said the route was yet to be determined.
Murphy said the purpose of this trip was to improve relationships, but also to show “affectionate firmness.”
He explained that European heads of state must be honest with their citizens about the kind of spying programs they have been running themselves for years.
“We can change our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, but they also need to understand that we are not the only one in the world doing espionage,” Murphy said.
In the meantime, Kerry is scheduled to travel this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to deal with the rancor engendered by U.S. strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as U.S. surveillance activities.
The London Stock Exchange closed lower on Thursday, weighed down by Shell's poor performance and the day after the Fed announced it was maintaining its support for the economy as planned.
Australian woman appeals her jail sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old Sydney resident, sentenced to 15 days in Phuket for falsely claiming she was assaulted by a taxi driver, appealed the judgment and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty by a Phuket Provincial Court on June 15 of making false statements after she told Thai police that a local taxi driver, accompanied by two other men who were controlling her, had assaulted her early on Sunday, June 10.
However, CCTV footage later revealed that she had returned to her hotel safely after parting ways with her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket police questioned Bamford for two days before she confessed to inventing the story from scratch.
She was detained in a cell at the local police station before the court hearing.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in a low-security detention centre on the outskirts of Phuket rather than a women’s prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian Rugby League player Peter Tunks, who called on the Canberra Foreign Ministry to help her daughter.
Tunks told the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about her daughter's well-being and wanted her to return to Australia.
“We’ve obviously had a nerve-wracking time, but we hope to get her home safely as soon as possible,” Tunks said.
Bamford appealed the judgment and was released on bail of 50,000 baht.
In Australia, the press said that in the meantime, she was on vacation in the Krabi area in southern Thailand.
Thai judicial sources said Bamford was represented by a local Phuket lawyer, but warned that the appeal could lead to an increased sentence of up to two years in prison and an incarceration in an adult prison.
However, after the recent murder in Phuket of Michelle Smith, an Australian travel agent, Thailand could also seek to restore its deteriorating image with tourists, which could lead to an acquittal.
French police will arrest Anderlecht supporters who came other than with the RSCA buses
French police have decided to set strict rules regarding the Royal Sporting Club of Anderlecht's match against Paris Saint-Germain scheduled for Tuesday, Brussels police zone spokeswoman Marie Verbeke said Friday.
Belgian fans of the RSCA who want to go to this Champions League match will have to use the travel system set up by the RSCA.
"The bus convoy will be escorted by police from a former Rekem border post to PSG stadium," the spokeswoman said.
The process will be the same for the return.
"If other supporters had an intention to travel to Paris by other means, the French police prefecture has announced that measures have been taken to make arrests or even custody," said Marie Verbeke.
Living together in French, the challenge of the Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board
At the Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board, 62% of students have a mother tongue other than French.
A year ago, this prompted a consultation with parents, students, teachers and education staff to consider ways to better integrate students who live across cultures.
The school board has just unveiled its vision of "Vivre ensemble en fran<0xC3><0xA7>ais".
Vision diversité has been working in schools for a year to help students of all backgrounds discover common references that are not limited to the French language.
The discovery of neighborhoods, our architecture, our places are landmarks.
Great names of writers, artists, whether they are of stock or have come from elsewhere.
Who are our builders?
"So we create projects in a way that they identify with all of this," says Vision Diversité president Aida Kamar.
Michel Venne, of the Institut du Nouveau Monde, identified several challenges for the school board.
"On the transmission, for example, of what Quebec culture is, the sense of belonging, the support to the staff in the transformations that we are experiencing, within the student clientele," he lists.
The Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board has created a research center that will give tools to teachers who, sometimes, also come from elsewhere.
Rachida Azduz, of the Université de Montréal, will be the scientific director.
The preparation to manage a class in a North American, Quebec context.
"Different educational strategies, that's the real need," she summarizes.
The research will focus on inclusion from all its angles: linguistic, academic, social and cultural.
