European inflation slides into food
Accelerated inflation in the euro area is primarily due to the skyrocketing growth in food prices.
The increase in prices in November has been higher than expected in the 13 countries of the euro zone, registering - after 2.6 percent in October - an annual inflation of 3.1 percent - announced the Statistical Office of the Union based in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts were only 3 percent likely, Bloomberg reported.
The European Central Bank (ECB), unlike the US, British and Canadian issuing banks, did not cut basic interest, on the pretext that the decline, together with rising commodity prices and the reduction of forced unemployment, would cause a spiral of inflation.
The ECB wants to keep the inflation rate below, but at least close to, two percent.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in trap 22: “negotiate” on inflation so that it does not have to intervene in this issue later.
Inflation of 3.3 percent, recorded in Germany, beat the 12-year record; while in Spain it rose from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
Inflation has soared in the euro area as a result of soaring food and energy prices.
Forward wheat prices increased by 88 percent and soy prices reached their highest level since 1973.
Similarly, much more had to be paid in 2007 for vegetable oil and dairy products.
The price of crude oil on the world market increased this year by 52 percent, reaching almost $100 a barrel last month.
According to the ECB, inflation in 2008 will jump from the current 2.1 percent to 2.5 percent, while by 2009 it will already fall to 1.9 percent.
According to analysts, annual inflation will remain in the next 3 or 4 months around 3 percent, however the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, the ECB is expected to reduce interest rates twice during 2008.
Gallup Predicts a Government Crisis
After a long stalemate, by early December support for the Alliance of Young Democrats rose significantly, reaching its highest level since 2002, while Gallup has never before experienced such a low — 13 percent — in the case of the Socialists.
The difference in the case of the parties’ secure voters – due to the greater firmness of the opposition voters – would mean a support of more than two-thirds (71 percent) against the support of one-fifth for the Socialists (20 percent).
According to the poll, the Democratic Forum and the Alliance of Free Democrats would not even reach the limit necessary to have any parliamentary seats: their support within the entire population is two percent.
Among safe voters there are one percent more supporters on both sides.
The economic environment continued to deteriorate even compared to the previous low point - it has never been so high, with 41 percent of those who rated the country's economic situation especially bad, while another 46 percent believe the situation is quite bad.
Families, after the more hopeful expectations of spring and summer, are now more pessimistic about changing their own economic situation.
As far as next year is concerned, the majority of the population is counting on the deterioration of the situation and only a tenth expects an improvement.
In December, 71 percent of respondents, higher than any previous Gallup poll, estimated that the President of the Government performs poorly rather than well his functions.
13 percent of respondents trust or trust Ferenc Gyurcsány a lot, while Viktor Orbán has the support of 38 percent of respondents.
54 percent of the population does not trust the head of government at all and 27 percent does not trust the president of the Alliance of Young Democrats.
One of the indicators of the configuration of the political situation is that, what proportion of society thinks that it is possible to control the discontent experienced in front of the person of the Head of Government without a change of government.
While after the October riots last year 35 percent thought it would be desirable to keep the Government and the Head of Government in power, currently this proportion is only 20 percent, while the relative majority (33 percent) believes that the only solution is to hold new elections.
Interest in the referendum is characterized by the fact that 60 percent of respondents to the question about participation answered that they would surely participate and another 20 percent said that they are likely to participate.
By comparison, only 55 percent of the population would surely participate in "a general election to be held this Sunday" and another 15 percent believe their participation is likely. Based on the current intentions of the voters there is no doubt about the result of the popular consultation.
74 percent of the population would disapprove of the payment of study fees, 79 percent of the service of medical consultations and 84 percent of hospital care.
If we look at these proportions only among the safe participants in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 percent of voters would reject the introduction of education rights, payment for medical consultations and hospital care.
The most expensive is the Auchan, the Tesco has quintupled its prices
The average increase in the price level of the hypermarkets of the Buda<0xC3><0xB6>rs gold commercial triangle was maintained by 16 percent, with the difference that this year the VAT has not been increased.
Article by Napi Gazdaság
This year also saw an average increase of 16 percent in the Buda<0xC3><0xB6>rs gold commercial triangle, the usual Christmas basket of the daily Napi, but in all hypermarkets there was a growth much higher than one thousand HUF.
As prices in food supermarkets had already "fired" in December last year, so there was no drastic percentage increase compared to the high starting point.
However, it is obviously frightening for consumers that what they were able to buy last year at a price well below nine thousand HUF, today they cannot do it even for ten thousand.
The Napi basket in the hypermarkets studied exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand HUF with a minimum of 91 HUF.
And the highest value basket was 10,573 HUF.
(In 2003 that basket cost 6800 HUF.)
The price of Unicum liquor and fish remained almost at the level of the previous year, but there was a sharp increase in turkey breast fillet, walnut and poppy seed.
The price of wheat flour and bread followed the data of the Central Statistical Office, although in the Auchan we have also found a kilo of bread for the price of 139 HUF.
The competition did not reduce the price of the product to less than 200 HUF.
It was also surprising in this store that the price of the Coke with redeemable two-liter bottle cost less than 200 HUF, so that this product, even with the price of the bottle, cost only 257 HUF.
All in all, Napi Auchan’s basket was the most expensive, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to our calculations, with respect to Christmas prices last year, Cora increased by 15, while Tesco and Auchan with about 18 percent the prices listed in the Napi basket.
Comparing the values of last year’s most expensive basket with that of this year’s cheapest basket, the difference has been 12 percent, while the growth between last year’s cheapest and this year’s most expensive has been 21 percent.
The average growth was 1480 HUF.
Last year the average price growth was 1206 HUF, so that during last year's Christmas in prices felt the increase in VAT.
It was precisely this process that shattered trade, supermarkets were visibly unable to make a decision on the price margin to be applied for each product and to calculate the effect of the change in prices on consumption.
(If the merchant misplans the speed of a product’s circulation, it can lose a significant profit in margin that fits the volume of sales.)
The increase in the price of the Napi basket reached such extremes as a result of the increase in VAT, that the most expensive was higher with HUF 1720 than the value recorded in 2006, while in the cheapest the difference was only a HUF 844.
No such extremes occurred this year, since the highest price now has been HUF 1630 more than last year and the cheapest also increased with HUF 1284.
Comparing the two Christmas seasons, there was a catastrophic growth in prices in less than 20 months, in hypermarkets the price of basic consumer items grew by more than 30 percent.
(However, this does not necessarily confirm the figures of the Central Bureau of Statistics: this office, in the case of some staple foods, recorded a price increase of more than 30 percent in the 12-month interval.
So for example, in addition to wheat, also in the case of egg.)
According to the Napi basket, in the latter case this seems almost impossible, because in the price of this product that was already quite expensive last year compared to the base, there was, in the worst case scenario, only a 10 percent increase in prices.
According to all indices, flour suppliers have a stronger position than egg suppliers, and can impose the drastic increase in prices even on multinationals.
Hypermarkets do not complain about the golden trading triangle, they constantly talk about positive results.
According to our experiences, most consumers in the three stores visited are no longer interested in prices.
Of all the products they buy large quantities, taking by pallets the preserved foods.
On Wednesday morning, large lines were formed in all three stores in front of the boxes because the number of customers suddenly increased.
However, we have information that in the interior of the country sales volumes are lower, many multinationals complain to the survey institutes because the income is below their plans and not only in the case of food, but also in the case of appliances.
Many hospitals save money on disinfectants
This year, several thousand infections have been recorded in hospitals, primarily due to the misuse of antibiotics.
The hygiene circumstances prevailing in hospitals, the overcrowding of the beds and the overload of the staff do not favor the control of infections - affirms the medical-head of department of the National Center of Epidemiology.
In many hospitals it is saved even with disinfectants.
Not long ago, a contagion with MRSA was diagnosed in the traumatology department of János Hospital.
In a man hospitalized after a serious accident, the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria was detected.
The patient was isolated.
The same type of contagion occurred in this same hospital earlier this year.
An injured person in a serious car accident was discharged from the hospital and the same patient shortly after had to return to the hospital as a result of the infection with MRSA and since then it has not been possible to perform an important surgical intervention due to the presence of the bacteria in his body.
As of 10 December this year, 1,094 cases of hospital-acquired multidrug-resistant infections have been registered in the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System, said Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>cz, medical director of the National Epidemiology Center.
This means that hospitals have certainly recorded this number of infections caused by multidrug-resistant agents, the rest is not known.
About two-thirds of infections (683 cases) are due to MRSA, i.e., methicillin-oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
One-third of humans carry Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their noses without causing any disease.
Infections caused by AS (e.g. throat inflammation, tonsillitis, skin infections, wound infections) react well to antibiotics and are easily treated.
However, once over- or under-applied to antibiotics, bacteria that normally react well to antibiotics, transform into highly antibiotic-resistant bacteria and quickly spread under inappropriate hospital conditions.
They can cause serious hospital infections, e.g. wound infections or septicaemia primarily in patients with transient or chronic immunodeficiency, in patients with a weakened body, in the elderly or in people of low weight.
In the opinion of the doctor-director of the János Hospital there is nothing special in MRSA infection, these infections are daily in hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, MRSA is only absent - said Tibor Nyulasi - where its presence is not examined.
Resistant to antibiotics
"These patients are isolated, nurse staff treat them in rubber gloves and mask and there are appropriate antibiotics for their treatment," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Inpatients are pre-screened for MRSA in their system, but infection cannot be prevented in all cases.
It is not fashionable to take samples
It would be possible to prevent hospital MRSA infections in most cases, however the current national hospital circumstances do not favor the prevention of the formation and contagion with multidrug-resistant pathogens - says Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>cz.
Because this infection occurs primarily in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should screen hospitalized patients and immediately isolate patients with MRSA.
However, in Hungarian hospitals it is not fashionable to take microbiological samples.
This is also due to the fact that the National Health Fund does not fund these medical examinations.
So the majority of cases come to light when the MRSA infections visible in the patient already occur - said the medical-head of department of the epidemiological center.
The European Union makes strict commitments for the application of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also national directives to treat infections and pathological conditions.
Efforts should be made to target antibiotic therapy, i.e. microbiological testing should be done to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always meet this requirement.
Microbiological samples are even less frequent in the case of walking patients or in basic care - said Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>cz.
Saves money with disinfectants
Scientific experiments have shown that in most cases MRSA is spread from one patient to another through healthcare workers.
Therefore, hand washing, the use of rubber gloves and masks play a very important role, however also in this sense considerable faults are experienced in hospitals.
MRSA is spread through droplet transmission and direct contact between people, however in national hospital circumstances it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient.
What’s more, hospital wards are often crowded, beds are often very close together, although to prevent the epidemic, patients should be separated by at least a distance of 1.5 meters.
Unfortunately it can be experienced also - it has added Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>cz - that in the hospitals of less favorable economic situation it is saved with the disinfectants, there are few nurses and many patients and therefore there is a greater probability for the infection.
In the opinion of Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>cz, where adequate preventive measures are taken, fewer infections of this type are recorded or the pathogen can be stopped.
Government program against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA infection is a huge expense for the National Health Insurance Fund, so in all countries it is fought against.
In England, for example, there is a government program to prevent and reduce cases of MRSA.
The program is apparently successful, according to the data provided, infections with MRSA show a decreasing trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has among its priorities the prevention of multidrug-resistant agents (including MRSA) and hospital-acquired infections due to these pathogens.
Negative breathalyzer control of police commander that caused fatal accident
The official expert report on the case of the fatal accident caused by the commander of the police of the district XXII has been made.
It is possible to exclude the possibility that he was driving drunk or in a dazed state the since resigned commander of the police of the district XXII, who on Tuesday hit and caused the death of a passerby - reported Friday Attila Morvai, spokesman for the General Prosecutor's Office of the Capital, after having prepared the expert report on the case.
The expert report confirmed the result of the primary blood alcohol control that had already found that the former police commander did not consume alcohol before getting behind the wheel.
The then head of the police station of District XXII, on Tuesday with his private vehicle when turning into the street Kossuth Lajos of District XXII hit a 55-year-old man, who intended to cross the street, but not in the area designated for pedestrians.
(This last fact, that is, that the pedestrian did not use the zebra to cross the street, according to the regulations of the Traffic Code are not extenuating circumstances, the driver must always give way when turning.)
The bystander lost his life after being hospitalized.
Because of what happened, the district police leader resigned and requested his retirement, according to the police statement, because he was very moved by the case.
The investigation of the case is in charge of the Budapest Prosecutor’s Office of Investigation.
Attila Morvai also said that the former police commander from the beginning collaborated with the prosecutors in charge of the investigation.
400 million euros more for infrastructure
Hungarian Finance Minister János Veres and European Investment Bank (EIB) Vice President Marta Gajecka signed three credit limit agreements worth a total of 400 million euros to finance education, transport and environment infrastructure, as well as the energy sector, in Budapest on Friday.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved in 2006 a budget of EUR 300 million to finance transport and environmental protection projects in the Hungarian budget, to be made from the Cohesion Fund grant, of which the parties had already signed a credit agreement worth EUR 100 million, the contract they have just signed concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The EUR 150 million credit agreement is also intended to finance the budget for educational projects.
The EIB approved a total of EUR 300 million for this objective in Hungary, and a decision on the use of the remaining EUR 150 million will be taken at a later stage by extending the credit agreement.
The parties signed a contract for 50 million euros for innovations, which the budget will mainly use for the innovation and research project of the University of Debrecen.
The talks also covered the construction of the 4th Metro line.
The agreement was reached that by the time Hungary finalizes with the EU the details of the financing of the Metro, they will return to the issue of whether or not it is necessary to modify the original contract and how to do it.
According to János Veres, this may take place earlier in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990 the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects in Hungary worth EUR 8.4 billion.
The interest on the loans is in line with EURIBOR and the EIB offers a grace period of 8 years, without charging a fee for keeping the loan at the disposal of the debtor.
Bulgaria, the real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is admirable - the attention of the whole of Europe is directed towards that little-mentioned Balkan country.
What, where and who buys in the even cheaper EU market, which will quickly become more expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The preferred target for real estate acquisitions in Eastern Europe is undoubtedly Bulgaria, with its cheap apartments on the ski slopes and chalets on the beaches.
The mountainous regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are the most preferred, while in the Albena beaches, the "Golden Coast", the "Sun Coast", the ancient Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are looking for real estate also in the surroundings of Kavarna and Balchik.
According to analysts of Re/Max in Bulgaria, sooner or later also the central area of the country - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will arouse the interest of real estate developers and more and more people will buy properties in the especially cheap area of Rus.
Similarly, the capital Sofia may be attractive, the commercial and office spaces promise a rapid recovery of investment.
Bulgaria is well on its way to becoming one of the most attractive golf havens in Europe, making it an outstanding destination during the other two seasons as well, in addition to summer and winter.
Therefore, cautious investors are already making their purchases, for example in the vicinity of Bansko.
In the opinion of analysts, those who buy real estate in Bulgaria, also strive to change their life and their way of life.
Most of the customers are English, but they also come from France, Belgium, Spain and increasingly from Romania.
Also present are the Maltese and Cypriot promoters and traditionally there are many Russian customers on the beaches of the Black Sea and in the ski paradises.
Foreign customers can be classified into three groups - says Georgi Jankov, regional director of Re/Max in Bulgaria.
Those who intend to settle here buy new or renovated properties for a price between 50 and 100 thousand euros or old houses in poor condition between 5 and 15 thousand euros, to renovate them later.
They require good communication and access, in addition to the proximity of a large city, shops and usually a local doctor is important to them.
The second category is the buyers of chalets (Bulgaria in December was included among the top 10 holiday destinations of the Germans).
The third group is the real estate investors who make their purchases in the hope of benefiting in the medium or long term.
The price of capital real estate is constantly growing, since the demand is increasing.
Although in the European Union Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices, in the last five years these have suffered an annual increase of 21 percent
The increase in the price of real estate considerably exceeds the growth of wages.
Fodor and the Six Hundred Hungarians
According to the Minister of Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor, the meetings at the expert level will end on Tuesday and on Wednesday after the official inauguration will continue the negotiations at the minister level on the international climate regime after 2012.
Experts and policy makers from 192 countries around the world are discussing the Bali Roadmap, which provides for post-period efforts to reduce emissions under the Kyoto Protocol, in force until 2012.
At present, lively discussions are taking place on the subject between developing and industrialized countries.
The United States has already indicated that for the moment it does not want to negotiate on precise figures, although it tends to reach the agreement that compared to the situation in 1990, until 2020 the emission of gases responsible for the greenhouse effect will decrease by 25 to 40 percent.
Another major theme of the conference is whether or not industrialized countries, in addition to reducing emissions, are willing to offer material and technological assistance to countries in need.
Agreement was also reached on the aid to be offered to developing countries.
The support fund, provided for in the Kyoto Protocol, will be led by a 16-member steering board, likely within the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF) - writes the "Piac est Profit".
The Six Percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Minister of Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor supports the EU’s efforts to preserve its leading role in global climate protection and promote the signing of the new international agreement until 2009.
The minister stated that the EU is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 from 1990 levels, regardless of whether the “post-2012 agreement” is signed or not, and is willing to commit to even a 30 percent reduction if the world’s other major developed regions and developing countries are also willing to make commitments in line with their responsibility and capabilities.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the signatory countries of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol committed to decrease by 5.2 percent, within this the then 15 EU member states committed to meet an 8 percent decrease.
The commitment of Hungary is to reduce by 6 percent the emission of gases responsible for the greenhouse effect with respect to the period between 1985 and 87, which our country will fulfill - notes the press release of the Ministry of Environment.
There is a lot at stake in Bali, since in two years we will have to sign the international agreement on long-term climate policy, because if not, it is certain that its entry into force would be postponed to after 2012. In this case the reduction commitments, assumed in the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new international climate partnership.
With this, the reduction of emissions would be delayed and an increase of more than 2 ° C of the average temperature of the Earth could not be prevented, a fact that according to scientists would have immeasurable and irreversible consequences.
British army recruits on YouTube
British army units in a video distributor release recordings of actions filmed in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularize themselves.
First the British Air Force (RAD) was the one that took advantage of the services of YouTube: the special units displaced in Afghanistan since March 2006 are uploading videos about their actions against the Taliban - the BBC reported.
These recordings made with mini cameras mounted on the helmets are controlled in Kandahar’s general operations corps, then sent to London to be uploaded to the Internet.
The political message is inevitable.
Already 139 recordings from the soldiers of the air force have been uploaded to the Internet in this way and their "channel" has already been seen by more than 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defence registered in the spring of 2007 under the name of "defense headquarters" and publishes videos of both actions perpetrated in Iraq and Afghanistan, while both the Ministry of the Commonwealth Office and the multinational forces in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channel.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally the air force had uploaded the videos for recruitment purposes, but in the opinion of the Ministry of Defence they also serve to present to the public the true purpose of the British Army's presence abroad.
This type of propaganda costs practically nothing compared to the conventional television spots of recruitment - it has declared to the BBC the expert in defense Gordon Mackenzie - instead, inevitably they have some political message, since in a specific form they justify the raison d'<0xC3><0xAA>tre of the military actions decided by the government.
The Americans made a video game.
The army is also concerned about the fact that, in addition to the suspiciously edited and censored recordings, amateur videos also appear in the distributor, for example on the death of soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, a little hypocritical, the officers speak at most of losses, without however presenting the bloody part of the fighting.
In addition, from the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan numerous videos recorded in real operations have been uploaded to the Internet, but the British army is only recently taking advantage of this opportunity.
Americans use a slightly different form for recruitment with the free downloadable shooting video games, called America's Army, in which in the middle of a more or less real situation the player can directly put himself in the place of the soldiers.
Tombola and salty cake at the ministries Christmas party
Labour Minister M<0xC3><0xB3>nika Lamperth does not seem very sentimental: instead of the Christmas party, she will hold a working meeting for her colleagues who will be able to say goodbye to 2007 with salty cake and coffee.
There is a ministry that will celebrate your party with live music, in another will create the Christmas atmosphere in the hearts of public officials with a raffle and a toast.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet - this is how power is entertained.
State offices are also preparing for Christmas.
The biggest Christmas party will be held at the Ministry of Defense, but not for Ministry workers.
On Orphans’ Christmas the children of fallen soldiers will receive gifts and on Missionaries’ Christmas the relatives of soldiers currently on missions abroad will be invited, as well as a reception for the press.
This portfolio will allocate 25 million for the festive atmosphere of the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (ANF) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (MET) will celebrate a luxurious party with respect to the parties of the other portfolios
The MET party will be held in the House of the Future, with a total budget of 4 320 000 HUF and of the six hundred workers of the ministry the presence of approximately three hundred and fifty is expected.
At the wallet party there will be a Christmas atmosphere, artists will also perform and there will be a raffle.
The ANF Christmas cost 4,700,000 HUF and was held on Wednesday in the building of the National Council for the Administration of Justice (CNAJ) with musical concerts and dinner.
Renting the room cost one million HUF, the rest of the budget was spent for the more than four hundred guests.
We have information that the workers of one of the ANF departments are also invited to another Christmas party that will be held by a tender management company called the Hungarian Center for Economic Development of Community Funds.
For this purpose they rented the entire building of the Comedy Theatre.
The information has not been confirmed by CHDE SA, as we are unable to communicate with the competent person.
You can attend without a suit.
The CNAJ building not only hosted the ANF party, but also that of the Ministry of Justice and the Police, which instead of Christmas celebrated the Lucia Day dance on December 7.
The CNAJ of them did not charge anything for the use of their facilities.
Five hundred people participated in the dance.
The party began with the minister’s words of greeting and after dinner there was live dance music.
Answering [origo's] question they reported: to attend the dance it was not mandatory to wear a suit or evening dress.
Health, work and local government portfolios are preparing for modest celebrations.
The Ministry of Public Health will organize a program and a party for its workers in its own building with a budget of 400,000 HUF.
Instead, Labour Minister M<0xC3><0xB3>nika Lamperth does not wait for her colleagues for an official Christmas party, but for a year-end work meeting.
One hundred and eighty guests are expected to drink only coffee and savoury cake, so the party will cost no more than HUF 350,000.
The minister for local governments, Gordon Bajnai will instead simply toast with his colleagues in the Ministry’s classroom for Local Governments and Territorial Development.
The Ministry of Finance (MF) will hold a Christmas party in its own auditorium with the participation of 436 workers.
The Christmas party will have a budget of 2500 HUF per guest - from this budget the reception with buffet and a toast will be paid.
Since János Veres is the minister, the workers of the MF every year celebrate Christmas in the same way.
On the other hand, there will be no festive atmosphere, the official character will be given not only by the ministerial speech, but also by the schedule of the afternoon of its celebration.
The agriculture portfolio will offer a New Year reception on January 20, in the Ministry will not celebrate Christmas.
The reception will be held in the Vajdahunyad Castle of the Municipal Park and according to the portfolio, there will be a budget of 1000 HUF per person for the one hundred guests.
This - according to the press department - is going to be a very simple standing reception, to which only specialized diplomats, accredited in Hungary, will be invited.
These receptions, which are held every year, begin with a brief greeting speech from the minister and conclude with a modest meal.
The Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Education and Culture will not celebrate any Christmas parties - this is what the corresponding press departments told [origo].
In the press department of the environment portfolio could not report on the budget of the Ministry's Christmas celebrations.
What is known is that for the party to be held in the Museum of Applied Arts was invited more than four hundred people.
The forces of the giant strike are gathering
The League Trade Unions and the National Federation of Workers’ Commissions will constitute a strike commission on Friday to coordinate Monday’s strike that will last indefinitely.
A protest rally will be held on Saturday, while on Monday - the day when the final vote on the public health law will be held - the work stoppage will begin.
This action will certainly cause great difficulties in transport, since the railway traffic will stop completely and until 1 p.m. the workers of the Budapest Collective Transport Company will also be on strike.
On Friday afternoon, the League Trade Unions will report on the details of their strike on Monday, which will be held jointly with the National Federation of Workers’ Commissions.
The strike commission of the LIGA and the National Union of Machinists that will coordinate the actions of Monday will also be constituted.
A protest rally will be held on Saturday, while on Monday the participating unions will go on strike indefinitely, if an agreement is not reached with the government.
This means that - on the day of the parliamentary vote on the public health law - they did not report on the date of the end of the strike.
If the National Assembly disapproves of the public health law, the unions will immediately withdraw their call for strike action.
Instead, if the law is passed, strike committees will meet and decide on the future.
On the basis of Monday’s agenda of the National Assembly, it is also possible that only the public health law will be voted on in the late-night hours, or perhaps around midnight.
As a result of the strike that will begin on Monday, there will be significant difficulties in transport: railways will stop working indefinitely, in the morning part of the Budapest public transport and more than half of the intercity bus transport of the Volán companies may stop.
Simultaneously, in many parts of the country there will be closure of half of the roads.
Numerous unions and civil organizations have joined the strike, their names being constantly updated on the League’s website.
Some unions announced their strike for an indefinite period, others for a definite period.
Until Thursday afternoon the State Railway and the Free Union of Railway Workers (SLTF) could not reach an agreement even on the minimum services, although, as the Christmas holidays approach, more and more people travel on trains.
According to information received so far, from the beginning of the day until 1 p.m. the workers of the Budapest Collective Transport Company, the Budapest Airports from 7 to 9 in the morning, will hold a four-hour strike the LIGA Trade Unions of the Electrical and Thermal Energy Industry, the Trade Unions of Educators called a strike of 2 and the Democratic Trade Union of Educators 8.
The Hungarian Association of Doctors will take a national strike at alternative times and the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers (SDTSSS), which is part of the Forum of Trade Union Cooperation, will hold a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands made by the League is for the government to withdraw its public health reform proposal and submit a new conception to social debate.
The second demand is that they gradually introduce the new way of calculating pensions that will come into force next year.
The third is that they ensure, even before 2010, in the case of advanced pensions, the possibility that occupations that deserve it can enter the system.
The fourth reason for the strike is that the Free Union of Railway Workers (SLTF), which is part of the League Unions, do not accept the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport on the railway side lines and expect another different proposal.
Political Capital[b1]: In the country the risk is increased by the Hungarian Guard
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, formed in August this year with the support of the Movement for a Better Hungary, from various points of view has increased the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In the company's "risk warning" it is written: in relation to the activity of the Hungarian Guard the greatest political risk is the fact that "with the aggravation of ethnic tensions existing between the Roma and non-Roma population of Hungary, even in the short term violent ethnic clashes may occur".
The main reason for this is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is probably the provocation of an event of this nature - added the representative of the research institute.
They stated that all this is due to one of the main faults of the protagonists of Hungarian political life: "the protagonists of public life ceded the public debate of the Roma problem to the representatives of radical and extremist political groups, who were able to base their political strategy on the discrepancies between Roma and Hungarians".
This aggravates the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts erupting.
In addition to that, according to the research institute, the activity of the National Guard, as a result of the great attention of the national and international media, "significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary abroad, especially as regards the stability and democratic development of the country."
They remind us that: since the autumn of 2006 the reorganisation of the radical and far-right groups in Hungary has received increasing publicity and impetus, and that since the summer of 2007 numerous organizations have been formed in the country that define themselves as "associations of national self-defence".
“The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as civil organizations, while openly proclaiming the training of their members for defense – even armed – (civil defense, national defense, defense of public order), alluding to the ineptitudes of the police, the army, that is, the State,” they add.
They stated: all this is done in accordance with the method that tries to give a civil presentation to different political aspirations, based on the discontent of society with politics and with political parties.
For highlighting the civil and the form of association in the case of these associations not only serves to avoid the legal problems of legal registration, but is at the same time also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a risk factor also from the point of view of neighbourhood relations.
In recent months, in numerous neighbouring states, the Hungarian Guard was referred to as a potential danger, while ultra-nationalist political figures in certain neighbouring countries want to justify their own anti-Hungarian policy with the creation of the Hungarian Guard.
All this influences the political stability of the region," they added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not an isolated phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so political risks were increased throughout the region.
They wrote that the Hungarian Guard works in a similar way to, for example, the Bulgarian National Guard, whose constitution was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (UNB).
The constitution of the Bulgarian Guard is due to the mass riots of gypsies that occurred in one of the neighborhoods of Sofia (Krasna Poliana).
Taking advantage of this situation, UNB decided to set up the guard, arguing that the organization's goal is "national self-defense."
In his opinion, in the last 17 years there was "gypsy terror" in Bulgaria, but the state remained powerless and indifferent to the facts - recalls Political Capital.
They added: This initiative has provoked a lively discussion in Bulgarian public opinion.
As it was written, it indicates the increased risk of ethnic clashes that certain Bulgarian Roma organizations have announced that to resist, they will constitute their own guard.
As the functioning of the Hungarian Guard has so far shown similarities with that of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be excluded that Hungarian gypsies also react to the threat in a similar way, organizing their own self-defense - it can be read in the warning about the risks of Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, director of research at Political Capital, told the news agency: “Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, every year they publish their risk analysis and when they experience something that can influence the change of risk, they inform the public, as happened in this case, by publishing their warning about the risks.
The party is not always written in red numbers
In Hungary the law precisely defines the days that are written with red numbers in the calendar and it has already become a widespread practice that around the holidays - that next year will be less - the working days are reorganized.
Even in the EU or in North America, holidays are not unitary.
Hungarian laws make a difference between a national holiday, a state holiday and a public holiday.
The festive days are fundamentally related to religious festivals and historical ephemerides.
We celebrate the New Year too: both the last day of the old year, and the first day of the new year is a holiday - the latter especially so that those who spent celebrating the old year can rest.
Throughout the year we have eleven holidays written with red numbers on the calendar.
It is a national holiday on March 15 in memory of the 1848 revolution and on October 23, the day commemorating the 1956 revolution.
On August 20 we celebrate the founding of the State, on May 1st the Labor Day, on November 1st and 2nd we remember our deceased family members and friends.
In addition, in our country there are two-day feasts Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
According to the calendar, our state, national or religious holidays rarely coincide with a weekend, so it is often bridged when before or after the party there is only one working day.
In exchange for the long weekends like this, during the previous Saturdays you cannot be absent from work or school.
It is the minister of labor who regulates in his specific decree when it is necessary to work exactly in exchange for the day directly preceding or following the feast.
This legal norm is mandatory for all employers and their employees, as well as for employees and public officials.
It is not mandatory, however, for companies and service institutions that, due to their function, work uninterrupted even during holidays.
This year the order of work can be altered only around the holidays of the end of the year: from December 24 practically stops life in the country, since according to experiences, most people "bridge" during the days between Christmas and the end of the year or take their holidays during these days.
Next year several of our parties will coincide with mid-week or weekends, so there will be fewer changes in working hours than this year.
First the agenda will be modified around the work party so that then, for four successive days, workers can rest.
Saturday, April 26 will be working day, so that in return Friday, May 2 is a holiday.
The other change relates to the feast of October 23: on Saturday, October 18, work will have to be done instead of Friday, October 24.
On the other hand, next year during the end of the year party you can rest, since from December 24th you will not work almost anywhere, even if the last day of the year is a Wednesday.
Six Little Deterrents to Bitter Your Colleagues' Lives
Emails that we forget to send, sound messages that we never receive, innocent lies that pass us by without us realizing it: all of them are part of our everyday "Folklore" at work.
You have to decide whether to adapt to the little annoyances or consciously avoid the confusing situations that can irritate others.
Advice.
Sorry, I forgot to let you know that you have been sought from the marketing department," says one of your colleagues.
That's why you didn't go on a date?
At best he feels it and tries to fix the issue, maybe he calls the marketing department to tell them that he forgot to give you the message (this is the least usual solution).
Most of the time the issue is resolved by apologizing.
Before proceeding to embarrassing explanations, it is worth meditating on the things with which you can embitter the lives of your colleagues and consciously strive to avoid them.
Borrow something that isn’t yours?
There is nothing more irritating than when you want to pick up a document, an office tool or your phone and you can’t find them.
Do you remember yesterday you put the stapler on the table, but by this morning it's gone?
Do you find your pen lost on the desk of one of your colleagues?
Don’t take anything away from your colleagues without asking them, because they will rightly be angry with you for taking their things away.
Do not take envelopes or post-it notes from the office because it can be unpleasant when you need them immediately and they sell out ahead of time.
Do you gossip about the private lives of your colleagues?
There is no good solution to stop rumors that are already running.
Who, what is he doing and with whom?
Where and why?
Don’t pass on to everyone the information (conjecture) you have about the private lives of your colleagues!
Don’t abuse your colleague’s trust when they share their innermost secrets with you!
Bury in yourself what you have heard and do not gossip about your colleague in his absence, even if others also know the things about him.
Are you going on sick leave unjustifiably?
When you call the office on the phone and say that you are sick and your head hurts excruciatingly, you feel bad or well, you feel that that day you prefer to rest; think about what others should do your work, your unpostponable tasks, your work for term.
Don't bother your colleague!
If you already know in advance that the next day you will not go to the office or something may happen to you, so you must stay at home, communicate them, so that your colleagues or your boss do not have to confront your absence the next day.
Rattles, giggles, phone calls
Are you involved in your work, but do you suddenly get rid of the giggles of your colleagues?
Have you inadvertently overheard a phone conversation that would have been better off not overhearing it?
Do not annoy your colleagues with your humming, singing, loud conversations (except when you do them above their head), kicking, constant blasphemies, expressing your discontents out loud.
All these can be annoying, even if they are not deepening at the moment in a project (writing, planning, organization).
Do you blame others for a mistake?
Don’t blame others if you haven’t finished something on time, forgot to send an important letter or message!
Don’t allude to the chaos that eventually reigns in the office, or to the noise that your colleagues make!
You must recognize if you have made a mistake that harms others and you must repair the fault!
Ask how you can fix your fault!
Do you feel too much at home in the office?
Jogging and sneakers: very comfortable habit for the house, but not suitable for the office!
Do not wear a comfortable jog even if your occupation allows it!
Don’t be clumsy, respect your colleagues and yourself by wearing everyday, elegant and beautiful clothes when your occupation demands it!
You lose interest if you want to meet the public’s expectations
The car moves slowly in the usual morning traffic jam.
A strange beat sounds on the radio: violin with electronic effects.
I turn up the volume.
It changes the rhythm of the music and to the previous tones the bass is added and then the voice of a female choir like a real jewel intervenes.
The mr2 channel plays the song Wings of Love by Zagar.
The national musical life did not spoil us much with quality electronic pop.
But now this jam feels totally different when you’re listening to Zagar’s new record.
Yonderboi appears. Some new and interesting songs of the underground [b2]digital [b3]national are gradually changing the image and although garage style rock is in fashion again, it breaks guitars, the national electro pop has shown: there are novelties under the Sun.
Balázs Zságer started his career in the city of Pécs, he played in the Yonderboi ensemble until he began his independent career perhaps because both can not be protagonists of the same ensemble.
With his project (Zagar) and his music, a mixture of jazz, danceable electronic music and pop, he tried to succeed, when he was asked for cinematic soundtracks [b4] (pl.
Ferenc T<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>k Szezon).
The wider public got to know the group that initially acted only in small clubs when the magazine wan2 selected its first album released in 2002 among the fifty most important national albums, classifying Zagar, along with Yonderboi as almost the only national trend-setter, able to be sold also in Western markets.
There is no doubt that Zagar and his ensemble are in fashion, but no one has asked them whether or not they gladly wear this label.
The ensemble reacted the way it should: it prepared a new and even better record.
The newly released album, titled Cannot Walk Fly Instead will be able to open new paths for them, although the title itself aims to establish continuity with the initial years in the city of Pécs.
For this title was one of the lines of the old set of Balázs Zságer.
The reference to the airy, the flight, is good, but in addition to the airy of the music, now appeared - in accordance with the spirit and trend of the time - the guitar that sounds louder, the effect of rock and roll.
With these songs he presented the album at the Millenáris Gy<0xC3><0xB6>rgy Ligeti, the singer who currently works in England with the ensemble The Puzzle.
The album includes a true success of the mr2 channel Pet<0xC3><0xB5>fi that lately broadcasts from morning to night popular music. This station brought to the ears of radio listeners the high-flying music of Wings of Love, recorded with six Hungarian singers (Divas Underground).
Everything is in order (?).
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: After this new success the question arises: what are you performing, to what extent is a music dedicated to a select audience?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of a select audience means little to me.
In my opinion there are two types of castes in light music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and sincere.
Also the so-called underground alternative music can be boring, meaningless and can be composed equally only for sale, which makes it commercial.
But also a good pop song can come from a sincere inspiration.
Also the attitude of the listeners works in this spirit, regardless of languages and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference between the reception of your music by Hungarian and foreign audiences?
B. Zs: Abroad, especially in the West of us, light music has bigger traditions.
There not only the fifteen and twenty-year-old generations attend the concerts, but also the older ones.
They pay much more attention to the changes taking place around them in light music, because they consider it part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the public play in your work?
Do you care who they are, where they are from, and how many people are listening to your music?
B.Zs: Naturally I feel good to see more and more people attending our concerts.
But we have never composed music for the market.
We don’t compose music for some purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the audience is rather felt in concerts where there is a reciprocal influence, but this is only in the inconceivable changes of the moment.
And yet, I realized that if you want to meet the public’s expectations, you lose their interest.
hvg.hu: To what extent do you intend to follow Yonderboi’s example?
He works alone and made his career rather to the west of us.
B.Zs: We don’t go his way, even though they sometimes try to compare our music to his.
We rather work as a team, rely on the musical presence of the other and let it unfold.
At first it was inevitable that they would compare our works with the music of Yonderboi, since many of us started our career in his group and from there we embarked on another path.
hvg.hu: In mr2's hit list Pet<0xC3><0xB5>fi Wings of Love is in first place.
Many people first heard Zagar's name in connection with this song.
Did you consciously open with this style to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We did not intend to write great hits and sell our album with these hits.
This song is more than that.
We added it at the end of the record, trying to relax after the sonic orgy of the record and the heavier tracks.
hvg.hu: How did you select the six singers?
Why exactly to them - what was the main reason?
B.Zs: The idea was to create a gospel-style choir.
Then came the idea of creating this choir of good-voiced soloists from our own national music scene.
Thus was created that chorus of six women - namely Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enik<0xC3><0xB5> Hodosi [Neo] and Juci Németh - which was later baptized as Divas of Underground.
hvg.hu: Did you compose the song exactly like that or did the girls change some things?
Zs.B.: This song existed a long time ago in instrumental version and when we already had all the material of the album, we thought that something is still missing.
The chord attracted the chant.
Even that night I recorded the song that the girls later learned.
It all came practically on the first try and in an incredibly spontaneous way.
I remember, I was very excited then, but naturally I also needed the Divas.
With my voice, it wouldn't have worked so well.
hvg.hu: Both in the concert and on the record it seems as if the girls are in the background.
There are no soloists (except for Judy Jay's short solo), they have no role of their own, they sing all together and no louder than the music, so the music doesn't just accompany their singing.
They are also on stage in the background.
Intentionally?
B.Zs: They are in the background simply because of technical problems.
Instead we consciously did not want to distribute soloist roles.
The song is also about it, about forgetting for a while our ego, the one who has come from where and where he is going, let those wings, the wings of love lift us up.
I would have wanted others to feel that euphoric mood that we felt when this song was born.
hvg.hu: Which one did you do the most work for?
Zs.B.: In the musical composition actually none, rather at the time of mixing there were more difficult pieces.
For example the Dorian Gray's Dilemma in which I'm playing on a concert piano or the Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where for a long time I did not want to work the groove and then, little by little everything was put in its place as in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite song on the new album?
Zs.B.: This changes constantly with the concerts and because I have already "released" the album.
The Prophet is a Fool, the Escape from the Earth, and the Never the Same.
A Treacherous Stock Broker Risks Billions for His Inferiority Complex
A disloyal embezzler.
This is how he points to his former employee, Jerome Kerviel, the French banking giant of Société Générale, who also owns the Czech Trade Bank.
He lost about five billion euros.
However, it seems rather that Kerviel was a great player who wanted to compare himself to his colleagues and, undoubtedly, with good abilities.
He sensed long ago, unlike all the big Czech banks, the crisis in the American mortgage market.
"He has a fragile character" was heard from his superiors, the same ones who sent him to the police.
But what emerges from Kerviel’s answers according to what the French media, such as the daily Le Monde, show is that he was a man who at the end of last year had a profit of more than 1.6 billion euros thanks to his businesses.
Crisis not just in America
“All I wanted to do was make money for my bank,” he says in his responses.
In fact, in the summer, it managed to earn 500 million euros during the American crisis.
This opportunity already saw it coming at the beginning of the year.
In February, some news began to be heard about so-called sub-prime mortgages being offered to low-income customers or those who in the past had problems with payments and that those customers would start having problems.
However, this crisis should not influence the entire economy.
Kerviel did not believe it and bet correctly.
And then, at the end of the year, its profits exceeded 1.6 billion euros.
“When I made my first $500 million, I didn’t know how to report it,” Kerviel confesses, adding that he has left nothing for himself at all.
Throughout the interrogation he stated that he had falsified the records in such a way that their discovery would not be reached.
He even went so far as to deceive the bosses, even as the Eurex Exchange began to take an interest in his business.
The risk became the benefit.
Were you afraid it would be discovered?
Rather, no.
“I thought I had made $1.6 billion for the bank and that from that simple fact, that would make them happy.”
Where did he get so much willpower to take that risk?
In my position I had to work gradually.
He joined Société Générale in 2000, exactly after finishing his studies in Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
Two years later he was already an assistant stockbroker and in 2005 he became a stockbroker with an annual salary of $90,000.
Still, I knew I would never win as much as the others.
“In my first interview in 2005, I noticed that they were looking at me cautiously.
Because of my education and also my professional and personal progress," Kerviel told the researchers.
But shortly after I joined the company, the first big success came.
Thanks to the actions of Allianz won, during the bombings in London, playing down a title of 500 million euros.
And this was a start-up mechanism, and he wanted more.
If you win, we'll let you
"This is like a snowball," police said.
But it is said that the bosses knew all this or rather suspected it.
"While making money, they closed their eyes."
Only then came the blow earlier this year.
In one day he lost a billion euros.
After the weekend in mid-January he wanted to erase all traces.
When he arrived at work on Monday, he was no longer working at the bank.
And two days later, the bank announced that it had lost 5 billion euros because of it.
And how did they manage to locate him?
He became suspicious after his vacation.
“I only chose four days for the past year.
The runner who doesn’t have a vacation is a runner who doesn’t want anyone to look at his record,” Kerviel said.
The Czech Republic has the possibility to get 365 billion
Ministers of the government of the Czech Republic signed yesterday with representatives of the European Commission a total of nine operational programs of which the Czech Republic can get 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion crowns).
This is almost half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels for the years 2007 to 2013.
Approximately 125 billion kroner will come out of seven operational programmes for the regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain around 100 billion crowns from the Enterprise and Innovation Programme.
Most of the money will go to transport, up to 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the largest of the operational programmes and represents up to 22 per cent of the resources that the Czech Republic can get from the fund.
This money increases the budget of the state fund for transport infrastructures that next year will have the amount of 90.8 billion crowns.
The Business and Innovation program should serve entrepreneurs and companies to obtain resources in business innovation.
Companies should get funding for the acquisition of new technologies, for industrial research and for the implementation of more effective organizational methods.
As far as the current use of EU funds is concerned, the Czech Republic is among the newcomer countries that use them the least.
Twenty-year sentence for former president of Nicaragua, decreed the court
The Nicaraguan Court of Appeals on Thursday imposed a 20-year sentence on the country’s former president, Arnaldo Alemán, who was convicted in 2003 of embezzling $100 billion (nearly 1.8 billion crowns).
Despite this, some time later, he was released from prison to go under house arrest on his estate not far from the Nicaraguan metropolis.
It is not at all clear at this time, according to the AP agency, that the then head of the Central American state between 1197 and 2002, is again behind bars.
According to the president of the Court of Appeals, Ileana Pérez, it will be up to the prison officers if they let Alemán finish his punishment at home or if they make him return to prison.
Four years ago, the court demonstrated how Alemán constantly transferred government money to a Panamanian company account.
This society was fictitious and the account belonged, in fact, to his closest relatives and supporters.
Part of this money ended up in the fund that Alemán created to finance his campaign in the 2001 elections.
This is how the budget was approved.
That's right.
The state budget was approved.
Why is this budget special?
It is the first one drawn up by this government and accepted by the majority of the coalition without the support of the opposition.
This year's budget was already approved with the support of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, because it was prepared by Minister Sobotka and <0xC4><0x8C>SSD could not afford not to accept it.
Apart from different debates before the vote on the vote of confidence in the government, this time, nothing dramatic happened.
The parliamentary assembly, in this traditional but most influential view, quietly passed the new law.
It is a great paradox.
Every government starts and ends with every chapter and budget line item, whether they like it or not.
The budget is an important part of politics but it hides the power rivalry between the government and the opposition.
It is important for the media and that is why they devote special attention to it.
Political discussions are much more interesting than simple numbers.
The State Budgets of the last governments of the Social Democrats suffered from three defects that for this year of 2008 it is not possible to solve so easily:
The first of these is the high share of mandatory laws, called as spending by the presidents who are not only pensions but also social benefits that already last year were approved before the elections by the "silent" coalition of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and KS<0xC4><0x8C>M.
The second is the deficit in the economy as a result of the first defect.
The third limit is the deficit of public funding, such as the municipal and community budget deficit.
Despite this, the greatest risk is not found in the state budget deficit.
It is public and relatively under control.
The time bomb, however, is in the deficit of the municipal and community budget.
Many mayors in order to obtain other sources of investment, apart from money from taxes, fees and credits from banks, often issued, without meaning, obligations with which they disproportionately indebted to their municipalities.
In recent years they managed to pay these debts through the massive sale of energy shares and other development networks they received from the state and privatization.
They do not currently have this resource.
If we stick only to the official and verified facts, we find that:
Our economy, already a few years ago, goes through phases of growth in the same way as the rest of the world, of which <0xC4><0x8C>SSD boasts.
This was the ideal occasion for his government to put the finances of the State in order.
Instead, however, the state continued to borrow.
The rest of the countries, with the exception of some like Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, saved much more reasonably than our republic.
It is a great shame that falls, above all, on the previous government.
We belong to the nations that within the global measures we are less threatened by poverty.
That is why there is no need for massive social programs that, unfortunately, in recent years have been uselessly inflated with gigantic measures.
And although they managed to eliminate some of the incomprehensible populist spending approved this year before the elections, if the retirement age and pension reform do not change soon, then it will be the end of any policy in this country, and whoever governs will only be a simple bureaucracy.
Exaggerating a little we can say that the politicians who govern will be transformed into civil servants, mechanical distributors of most of the tax money for retirement and social benefits.
That is why this year’s budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can stop the pressure of the normal expenses of the presidents’ expenses.
The planned deficit of more than $70 billion for 2008 would have been absolutely unnecessary, if the past government had not squandered what they could in the last ten years.
We would not want the politicians who govern to become only civil servants, so we must be patient and give this weak coalition government, which realizes that the state can only spend what it is able to get from taxes and fees, the peace of mind for the preparation of other reforms of the laws.
Only this will enable the gradual achievement of a balanced State Budget.

The banks want to solve the crisis.
The US Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian Central Banks decided to fight together against the financial market crisis.
More than one hundred billion dollars will be received in the Monetary Marking through tenders.
In these tenders, banks auction the interest rates at which they are able to lend money.
For example, the American Fed will send forty billion dollars to tender, and then another twenty-four billion will be provided by the central banks of Europe and Switzerland.
After the September 11 attacks, it is the first time that central banks from different states have agreed on this coordinated process to protect and mitigate the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step must solve the biggest economic problem, namely the continued growth of the free capital shortages that banks could lend," wrote Bernard Baumohl of the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group in his report for clients.
“This coordinated action by central banks likely reduced the U.S. recession from 65 percent to 50 percent,” Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already spent sixty billion dollars on unpaid loans, mostly in the United States.
Economists still expect billions in losses.
“Central banks must be really afraid of what still awaits them when they decided to take this step,” said Kieran Davies, chief economist at ABN Amro.
"It seems that the situation is really bad," he added.
Central banks fear that they have the same problems of access to loans and that therefore they will have to lend more expensively to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the American economy into recession with different impacts on the growth of the world economy.
The central banks thus decided, after they failed to reduce the so-called LIBOR rate, London interbank rate that is used for the loan of money in the interbank market.
This means that banks were constantly afraid to lend themselves money even when the central banks of the US, Canada and Britain lowered their interest rates several times during the fall.
"It will have the same effect as another fall in interest rates," Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some economists are not surprised that the step taken by central banks contributes to igniting the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem that is the fall of the real estate market in the United States.
Klaus: The debates of environmentalists are incredible
Global climate change mainly affects developing countries.
President Václav Klaus spoke again on the issue of global warming.
The criticism now arose with the closing of the UN international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, Not Green Planet, he commented that the debates of environmentalists are incredible.
According to Klaus, it is unacceptable not only the structure of the conference that creates a strange mix of government representatives and non-governmental organizations but the fundamental difference between the rhetoric used and the reality.
“There the debates are barely structured, they are fireworks of words, substitutes for the solution to the current problems,” Klaus said.
The Czech president during the presentation of his book stressed that this issue is very important to him and that is why he is interested.
He also expressed his joy to discover his book translated into German because as he said "many times I only find the caricature of my ideas".
Now interested parties can find out about their varied opinions.
Klaus recalled that he is not a climatologist but that he has, in his opinion, enough assumptions to write a book like this.
He is academic, able to follow and judge a specialized dissertation, has experience with statistics and is also an economist.
At the main moment of the closure, he expressed his thoughts that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are normal, that there is no agreement on global warming among scientists, that the consequences of the current changes are not so great and serious, nor do they represent possible disasters, and that attempts to influence climate development are useless, ineffective and costlyly unacceptable.
Moreover, as a man experienced with totalitarianism, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he feels is a dangerous way to limit the freedom of others.
To the questions of those present he repeatedly explained that he is not against "reasonable defenders of the environment but against environmental activists who do not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits."
Klaus spoke on the same subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayes Institute.
600,000 people failed to change their driver’s license
Six hundred thousand drivers were passed the date and therefore did not manage to change their old driver's license whose validity ends at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can request the change so that officials can give them time until the end of the year to issue the new card.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that after New Year there will be hundreds of thousands of drivers on the roads without a valid driver’s license.
According to traffic, the license has not changed mainly those who no longer even want to drive.
While in the villages they announce a rapid decline of the change of card, the offices of the metropolis are full of applications and the interest for the new card has increased.
The City Council estimates around 2,000 customers per day.
In the queues wait half an hour.
Around 140,000 drivers have not yet been issued a new driving licence in Prague.
The issuance of a new card lasts twenty days.
However, it is possible to request the issuance of the card within a shorter period of five days.
But in that case the driver must pay five hundred crowns.
Drivers who must change their license and do not reach the end of the year, but will go out on the roads without a valid card will risk a fine from January.
The offender will pay a maximum of two thousand kroner.
The officer can fix the violation with a reprimand.
If it is an administrative offence, the fine will amount to 2,500 kroner.
According to the above information, a person who does not go anywhere could receive a fine.
They could presumably pay up to 30,000 kroner.
The Ministry appealed to the offices for moderate fines of up to 1,000 kroner.
According to Karel Hanzelka, a spokesman for the transport ministry, fines of 1,000 crowns do not threaten anyone.
According to him, the driver’s license is a document in which people can decide whether they want it or not.
It is not the identity card that every person must have valid.
People who don’t want to drive should hand in their driver’s license.
Just bring it or send it by registered mail to the municipal offices.
At the end of the year, the cards issued during the years 1964 and 1993 are no longer valid.
However, drivers will have to gradually change the other types of driver’s license.
People with the document between 1994 and 2000 have up to three years to change it.
The validity of the card that was issued between 2001 and 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka it is about 2.6 million more documents.
The court reduced the sentence to Berdych's accomplice detectives
Former policemen Josef Opava and Petr Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k accused of complicity with the criminal David Berdych will spend between thirteen and ten years in prison.
The High Court of Prague decided as a final deadline to reduce the sentences, the first to one year, and the second to two years.
The detectives of the department of Prague against organized crime were going to fall, in the beginning, between 14 and 12 years.
Today's decision can no longer be appealed, only by revocation by the High Court.
Berdych is also indicted in this case, but the verdict of the Court of First Instance awaits him first.
In other cases, however, he has already been sentenced to a total of 16 years.
He can't get any more.
In January, the District Court recognized the involvement in the robbery of 19 people and the High Court today revoked 16 of them.
Most of the defendants’ allegations were rejected by the investigation because they were fabricated causes.
According to the Central Bohemian Senate, members of the police in agreement with Berdych passed information from police sources to the criminals, covered up the robberies, and helped members of the criminal group avoid penalties.
These criminals handed over 30 percent of their theft to Opava and Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k.
The indictment refers to the criminal acts carried out by the group between 1999 and 2001.
As for the theft, their victims suffered serious impacts on their health but they are also accused of the abuse of power as public agents and without weapons permission.
At the home search, police found pistols, steel-core ammunition, a laser-guided gun and a machine gun.
The group of criminals, according to the indictment, stole tens of millions of crowns from them.
With the exception of nearly 20 men in this trial, the court has already found Berdych and other defendants guilty.
Other men related to Berdych’s case are still testifying from other trials, and in some cases have yet to appear.
Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> P<0xC5><0xAF>t and Maro<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0xA0>ulej, who have so far avoided trial, are in prison in Ireland where they await the final decision on their surrender to the authorities of the Czech Republic.
One account for changing a few children: 12 million
The lawyer of the affected families, Igor Veleba, wants from T<0xC5><0x99>ebi<0xC4><0x8D> hospital 12 million kroner in compensation plus the costs of the trial.
For each of the mothers, three million, for the fathers, two million, and for the children, one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
The hospital’s legal representative, Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Dostál, does not agree in principle with Veleba’s proposal.
"Such a demand we do not approve, it is too high," Dostál said after today's meeting.
"In order to get an idea of this counterproposal, we need the report of the specialist that the counterparty sent to investigate.
We'll find out if it has any rescission value.
We remain in the opinion that there will be hundreds of thousands for everyone," Dostál stressed.
The amount should move between 100,000 and 200,000 kroner for each parent.
At the beginning of the cause, Jablo<0xC5><0x88>'s family wanted, for every month they did not raise their biological daughter, one million crowns.
Velaba was used as a basis for negotiating compensation for the specialist's report, only that it was drawn up at the Motol faculty hospital in Prague.
According to specialists in psychology and psychiatry, the girls’ parents suffered from psychological impact and stress of different levels and depth.
The stress situation was better supported by the men although they fought with recriminations for the change of the girls.
Women carry it worse with the trauma they are currently experiencing and with respect to what is happening today, Veleba completed.
Veronica and Nicola were exchanged by nurses at the T<0xC5><0x99>ebi<0xC4><0x8D> Maternity Home last year, on December 9.
Last week, the girls returned to their biological parents, Nicola to the <0xC4><0x8C>ermákov<0xC3><0xBD>s in P<0xC5><0x99>ibyslavic, and Veronica to Libor Bro<0xC5><0xBE> and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jablo<0xC5><0x88>.
The governor of Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina, Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Vystr<0xC4><0x8D>il, at the end of October gave each family 100,000 kroner as compensation expenses for the mistake made in the T<0xC5><0x99>ebi<0xC4><0x8D> hospital that the region administers.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured by law as liability for damages.
In case of errors they must draw from the reserve fund and can extraordinarily ask for help from the administrator.
The court has to date awarded them proportionately low compensation, sums which were calculated according to tables counting in the hundreds of thousands and extraordinarily one million kroner.
Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka lost the Kingdom of Wallachia
Bolek Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka lost the lawsuit over the trademark Kingdom of Wallachia.
According to the judge of the Ostrava provincial court he was the first to use the brand Kingdom of Wallachia but the project was created for many years by Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> with whom the actor collaborated.
Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka did not appear at the oral hearing today.
According to your lawyer, the case is probably not over and your client will appeal.
"The lawsuit is that Mr. Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team are parasites on the popularity of Bolek Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka," Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka's lawyer said after the trial.
For him, before the words Kingdom of Wallachia, everyone gets the image of the actor and comedian.
The same idea also has Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>.
“We’ve had about 10 years of work behind us.
Searching for money and inventing activities," he said.
For him, the cause of the lawsuit is in the money.
"After years I have realized that the project is successful and that therefore I could also receive something.
They want to live as parasites of our work," he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court the brand Kingdom of Wallachia was first used by Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka in his TV show.
In 1993 he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohat<0xC3><0xBD>.
Then it was not a question of orienting him towards the creation of a fictitious kingdom.
Some years later Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> decided to edit the passport of the Kingdom of Wallachia.
From this comic origin resulted a lucrative business and entrepreneurial activity from which Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> later created the Kingdom of Wallachia society.
In 1997, Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka agreed to use his name and signature on passports and even offered his holders discounts to visitors to his farm and attendees of his shows.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge today also ruled that Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> only used a simple idea that Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka made public on stage for his own business benefit.
"It is clear that Bolek Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka helped the popularity of the Kingdom of Wallachia," the judge said.
He added, however, that in the spirit of the project is Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team who were fully dedicated to it.
The collaboration, between the now decomposed parts, continued until 2000 when Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> organized for Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka the official coronation in Vset<0xC3><0xAD>n.
From that moment on, conflicts between Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka and Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> began, culminating in the overthrow of "King Boleslav I, the Chosen for Ever".
The leading role in the kingdom, through Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, led to the singer Jarmila <0xC5><0xA0>ulaková, as queen mother.
In 2002, Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka filed an indictment against Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his society, which to this day has been rejected by the court.
Something clear could bring in the litigation, the tournament for the throne with its princesses, which Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> is already preparing.
Out of him should come the new king.
He did not want to reveal more data or dates.
“We are in no hurry.
It would have to be something like the king’s road to Moravia.
The king would have to be elected on a specific date.
Even Mr. Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka can run," Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> added.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: prejudices overcome
I’ve never really liked the Peugeot 206.
Its running characteristics were never anything special, the quality of the gearbox, maneuver and also the product could be characterized as below average.
But now there is on the market its successor, the Peugeot 207, and this one, it is much better.
This Combi called SW is a little more advanced and for me, I can only think better.
When I tried the classic five-door Peugeot 207, I complained, for example, about the headroom in the back seat.
But this would be the only complaint because the body of the Combi means in this sense, that I will not suffer in front of the two meters in length.
Flying around the world
I pass through the interior quickly so as not to repeat it too much.
It is an elegant design where the only defect is the poor central tunnel.
Here I would value more the design invention although already the car looks quite elegant.
The seats are comfortable, there are the times when we complained about short seats and backs.
Also unlike the 206 model, the lateral steering has improved considerably.
What about the space?, and here you can feel how the body measurements have grown.
In the Combi disappears the aforementioned shortage of space in the header.
Suitcases to the trunk
But the main thing in this vehicle is its trunk.
I must rate it as very accessible (thanks to the folding rear door) and a well-distributed storage.
The dead spaces are equipped with rubber straps that are an ideal solution.
They do not disturb, and can extend to the point of holding heavy objects.
But let's stay in the warehouse.
According to the tables, in basic regime it has a capacity of 428 liters which compared to the competition is rather an average value.
But not compared to the best-selling vehicle of the same type in the Czech Republic, the <0xC5><0xA0>koda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the Mladá Boleslav model, we find that the Peugeot lags behind with its noticeable 52 liters.
While on holiday abroad or when placing the child's stroller its value is critical.
But if I had to comment something positive then I must quote the floor that remains quite flat after knocking down the backs of the second line.
120 horses in four gears
Our tested car was equipped with a four-valve injection ignition on a capacity of 1.6 l. and a force of 88 kW.
And to tell the truth, that's what a 1600 should look like that belittles the familiar five-door.
It is silent, consumes little and above all, has momentum.
If I compare it to the <0xC5><0xA1>koda era back then, which seemed as if the exhaust pipe was plugged by a rag, I can say that I can be impressed with this one.
The prices respond
The price of the car is not for every pocket.
We must, however, keep in mind that we have tested a vehicle elegantly equipped and with a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with injection ignition of 1400 by 329,900 crowns, can still be.
Our aggregates put it from 410,900 kroner, which is already too much.
The tested Premium rate already reaches another 80,000 kroner.
Only that we would still have airbags in the headers, automatic air conditioning, automatic windshield wipers, automated rear windows...
That is, the car with everything in it, costs 531,900 crowns.
It is a lot, but count on the complements of the team in the Fabia and it will reach a fairly similar number.
It is now up to us to decide which of the two brands.
Slovak students do not integrate into English schools
English schools are attended by children from Eastern European countries, and as a result, locals fear more changes in schools.
The integration of Eastern Europeans for now only brings a number of problems.
Even British schools register those cases where conflicts between emigrants and native children increase in violence.
The problem of the integration of Eastern European children into British schools is well illustrated in the northern city of Kent where conflicts between natives and Slovak emigrants are beginning to grow.
Discussions, extortion and arguments between students have already reached even the parents themselves.
The situation has gone so far that police in Chatmam arrested a Slovak woman who was beating a ten-year-old student with a green stick.
In her defense, she said the girl was insulting her son with racially charged insults.
The police also had to act after an attack by two underage girls on a Slovak migrant.
The girls treated him with racist slurs and threw stones at him.
“As we were going home, a boy came up to us at the bus stop and started spitting at us.
When I told him to leave, he gave us the gesture of throwing apples and pears at us, and then he pulled down his pants and showed us his butt," the Slovak student's mother told The Times.
The complaints are from both sides.
One of the natives even designated the conflict with the emigrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The cases already mentioned above, show us how the environment in English schools begins to be quite tense.
In Great Britain there are 70,000 Slovaks registered who came here for work reasons.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak students attend English schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors it is really the island of freedom.
Anything you expect from your vacation can come to pass, as long as you choose it correctly.
Sandy and golden beaches, big waves or a calm sea like a pond.
the palm trees and all enclosed with waiters offering pizzas on the beach, ice cream or varied cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the island of the Caribbean Sea you can find all this and much more.
Only on one island can you find much more, and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of all the islands of the Greater Antilles.
In the time of the Spaniards, Cuba became the bastion of the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a warehouse and cargo port for the treasures that the Spaniards extracted from America and brought to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional grew in the late 1920s.
He was ordered to build one of the heads of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, since everything about criminality in the United States (and therefore prohibited) was welcomed and supported in Cuba as drugs, gambling and prostitution.
Among his guests were, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana tall buildings emerged, wide avenues ran the cars that were a symbol of worship in the 50s of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a hacienda in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojimar he had his yacht.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio left their signatures the stars of the show business and politicians from all over America.
What about today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita abánense you can also leave your autograph.
In the bar of the expensive Hotel Nacional they mix cocktails according to your wishes.
And those cult cars of the 50s, to this day still work in Havana, because those Lada and Fiat that arrived a long time ago have rusted among these humid and salty winds.
Even though Havana, especially the old quarter, is deteriorating noticeably, there are not as many wonderful colonial monuments in the surrounding area as there are.
Other places metamorphose into beauty, for example, Trinidad.
Because tourism brings so much necessary money, its development is guaranteed.
In the last fifteen years new hotels have grown not only in Havana but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holgu<0xC3><0xAD>n and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a curiosity that is unique in the world and that is highly valued by railway lovers.
Sugar cane is transported from the immense plantations to the sugar factories by narrow tracks in steam or electric machines.
Their garages for decades were not discovered and are now there, machines that work and whose sister models in other parts of the world are only found in museums.
Where to go?
The place best known to most visitors does not change.
And for this reason, it is not necessary to talk more about Havana or Varadero.
Perhaps, just remember that in the aforementioned Hemingway estate there is a museum that for those who are lovers of the writer, should not miss visiting it.
The Vi<0xC3><0xB1>ales Valley is the most picturesque corner of Cuba to the west of the island.
Exuberant vegetation that grows on limestone rock lands.
Mogotes, limestone pylons and rocks of steep elevations in the valley falls, and in their caves fertile lands acclimatize thanks to which rock formations are formed that hide dense vegetation.
The valley is the place where probably the highest quality tobacco is grown in Cuba.
Visiting one of the Havana cigar factories you can find its final product.
Perhaps someone finds it interesting that the Chilean part of the series, Major Zeman, was shot there.
Trinidad
It was founded not long after the Spanish colonized the island.
Slavery and sugar brought her fame and wealth.
Wealth became beauty with the constructions in the small town.
Spanish colonial architecture, especially influenced by later French settlers, has hardly changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Escambray mountain range, is a place so remote that even in the 50s of the last century there was no road that connected it with the rest of the country.
Such isolation helped her stay out of the rest.
Nothing new was built and therefore nothing was destroyed, because each person was happy to have somewhere to live.
If you have more time to be in Trinidad than a single afternoon, it is worth knowing interesting places in the nearby surroundings such as Ancon Beach or the valley of the sugar factories.
the night belongs to the House of Music, which animates with its music the silence of the mornings.
Baracoa
A small town on the western tip of Cuba, it is considered by some to be the most beautiful on the island.
Surely that opinion is already confirmed by the road itself.
The two roads that arrive there from Guantánamo must pass through high and broken mountains, as well as a nature that barely knows the action of man.
This eastern place of Cuba has been inscribed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO thanks to its intact nature.
There they make the best chocolate, in their church they have the cross of Columbus (actually it is a cross that arrived 100 years after the landing) and from the hill, where the castle was located and now there is a hotel with the same name, you can see the mountains and among them the best known, the Anvil.
Coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra, the Bay of Pigs and the island of Pines, the Cabaret Tropicana, the patron saint of Cuba, the Virgin of Charity of Copper, Santer<0xC3><0xAD>a, an African religion practiced by the descendants of those slaves, could fill many pages.
As they say, it’s best to see it sometime.
Allies are passive in Afghanistan, say Americans
Few soldiers and insufficient equipment is what is influencing the progress of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO, according to US Defense Minister Robert Gates, should design a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not working as expected, agreed in Edinburgh (Scotland)the representatives of the countries that have troops in the southern part of the country.
At the same time as conflicts with the Taliban movement are growing, today, the eight participating states are discussing the allies’ plans and coordination.
While the United States this week through its defense minister, Robert Gates, encouraged NATO forces to step up, Britain sees strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and the sharing of development aid as a priority.
“The development in Afghanistan is palpable but the armed forces can only be one of the solutions.
The next step is to make it possible for the population to start economic and security development on their own," Defence Minister Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan rebels according to the US military is higher than in the last five years.
The number of violent actions grew compared to the last year by 27 percent, and in Helmand province up to 60 percent.
NATO countries have around 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, a quarter of whom are in the south of the territory.
However, for the United States, the allies have reached the same limit in terms of organization and equipment of the units.
They are calling for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
“We’re going to have to think seriously about concrete goals for the future and how we’re going to achieve them,” Gates said.
In a similar vein, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop also spoke today.
“I’m not happy to know what we have on earth and heaven in Afghanistan.
We have ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment that we would need, and that’s not much,” De Hoop told Reuters at the end of a three-day meeting with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is Passive
Among the countries attending in recent months, there is a controversy over whether all allies are doing their utmost in Afghanistan.
For passive was criticized, for example, Germany.
"The Germans have a relative number of replacements in Afghanistan.
But they are in a zone of minimal violence and the demands of struggle there are not as high as in ours, in the southern and eastern part of the country," Gates said.
The tabloid Sun this week called the German soldiers vague.
"Afghan rebels discover that the Germans are playing while our boys are fighting," Sun wrote in a piece accompanied by photographs of German soldiers playing table tennis.
Germany's Bild responded to the attack and posted a photograph of British troops playing a rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
State debt will reach 1 trillion in 2009
For every Czech the state owes 84,000 kroner.
The total debt in September amounted to 842.7 billion kroner.
This year the government planned to lend 159.2 billion kroner.
However, at the beginning of December the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns thanks to the improvement of the evolution of the economy of the state budget.
The state debt of the Czech Republic grew at the end of September to 842.7 billion kroner.
In nine months of this year it increased by 40.2 billion kroner.
However, since June it has decreased by 13.4 billion kroner.
So today, the Ministry of Economy confirmed its data on the state debt of early October.
For every Czech, the debt corresponds to 84,000 kroner.
For the whole of last year, the state was in debt with more than 111 million crowns.
“For now it seems that thanks to next year’s low deficit we could cross the trillion-kronor border into 2009.
Next year the debt should move between 900 billion and 1 trillion kroner," Patria Finance economist David Marek told iHNed.cz.
Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Pikora, an economist at Next Finance, said: “We could pass the billion mark during 2009.
Exactly when that will depend on the next budget that we don’t yet know.
If the situation on the political scene was seen to change and politicians were able to save, then it could be delayed to 2010.
But I don’t see such a change,” he added.
Doubt is growing
State debt creates debts in the central government and arises, above all, from the accumulation of the state budget deficit.
The state debt is paid through treasury bonds, government bonds, direct loans or for example loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state’s domestic debt grew this year from 38.5 billion kroner to 719.4 billion kroner.
Foreign debt has so far grown from 1.7 billion kroner to 123.3 billion kroner.
The so-called negotiable state debt at the end of September contained 803.3 billion kroner since June reduced by 13.7 billion kroner.
The average maturity of the state debt increased by 6.5 years.
“The total year-on-year debt from the first to the third quarter creates 13 percent which is huge given how the economy works.
It is interesting that the growth is generated mainly from bonds where there is a growth of 20 percent.
It’s bad that the debt is growing but on the other hand it shows that it’s going to be negotiated until there is a pension reform,” Pikora said.
Better than expected
From the strategy of payments and management of the state debt for 2007 it is drawn that the government planned this year to lend 159.2 billion crowns.
At the beginning of December, the ministry decreased the plan by 152.8 billion crowns thanks to the improvement of the evolution of the state budget.
The amount is composed, above all, of the deficit of the state budget that this year will be 76 million crowns instead of the expected 91.3 billion crowns.
The remainder consists of planned maximum resources for the Czech Consolidation Agency with some 13.3 billion kroner, the reserve of 10 billion kroner for pension payments, 43 billion kroner to finance state bonds and 1.8 billion kroner in loan payments from the European Investment Bank.
He compared today in front of a court to Khartoum for having given a name to a teddy bear
The British professor tried in Sudan for insulting Islam has been sentenced on Thursday afternoon by a court in Khartoum to 15 days in prison and expulsion, said his lawyer.
The British woman was accused of having allowed pupils aged 6 to 7 to give the name of Mahomet to a teddy bear when any representation of the prophet of Islam is illicit.
He was liable to a penalty of lashes.
The 54-year-old British schoolteacher from Unity High School in Khartoum, Sudan, was arrested on Sunday at her home and charged with assault on Islam and sedition under article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, following several complaints by parents of pupils to the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story actually goes back to September, when this teacher asks her students, 6/7 years old, to choose a name for the class’s teddy bear.
“Eight names come out of children’s mouths, like Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed,” says school principal Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a class vote, 20 out of 23 children have chosen Mohamed as their preferred name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children have made a book for the class with the photo of the bear with the following legend "My name is Mohamed".
The bear himself bore no label with this name, but the problem is simply that of the depiction of the prophet regarded as an insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, a teacher at the same school in Sudan, said that he knew her well and would never have done anything that could be insulting to a religious faith, "I'm sorry only that I asked the children to vote for a name", it is according to him only an "innocent mistake".
This view was shared by many of the school teacher's students, who described her as "very attentive to her students" and "never talking about religion in class".
Remember that the name Mohamed is also the second most given name in Britain, it is written in English with 14 different modes.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules concerning the use of this name?
Can we give it to a toy, for example?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
They did not reach an agreement on Wednesday on the future status of the province, during the last session of negotiations in Vienna.
In the end, failure.
The Serbs and Kosovo Albanians on Wednesday morning ended a sixth and final session of discussions in Baden, Austria, without having been able to overcome their differences on the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach an agreement on the status," European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger said during a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was " at stake " , his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their efforts to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of negotiations.
“We do not foresee violence for now but we are entering a very difficult period,” he added, noting that “obvious tensions exist.”
End of mediation on 10 December
The mediators of the troika, which regroups the European Union, the United States and Russia, will go one last time on Monday to Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the 90% Albanian-populated province could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko return their relationship to the UN Security Council by December 10.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and final session of negotiations since the troika was tasked with a new UN mediation last August.
Americans and Europeans expect their mediation to end on Dec. 10.
The Russians, who have already blocked in the Security Council the granting of independence in Kosovo, they insist on a pursuit of the negotiations beyond this deadline.
"Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," Botsane-Khartchenko said.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of UN administration in Kosovo, the West sees independence under the supervision of the European Union as the only viable solution.
Pristina feels prepared to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council does not resolve in its favour.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached," the president of Kosovo's autonomous authority, Fatmir Sejdiu, announced at the Baden hotel where these "last-chance negotiations" had been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future prime minister of the province, has given part of his regrets.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade "belonged to a past that has led to homicides and deportations."
" Domino Effect "
Serbian President Boris Tadic, for his part, considered that a compromise was always feasible, warning the Albanian majority in Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of independence for the province.
Belgrade says it particularly fears a " domino effect " in a region still weakened by the wars of independence of the 1990s.
"For Serbia, he said, this does not mean that a compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision should belong exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian ally has a veto.
" The Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word "
"Only a solution in the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia," Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
" These negotiations have lasted two years.
They must end as they began: in the Security Council.”
To journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had replied that " the Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word on the status " , adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanians would be made " in concert " with the Westerners.
Bush signs an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced, during the opening of the international peace conference he convened Tuesday in Annapolis, Maryland, that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a common declaration.
He said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately enter into negotiations with a view to finding a final settlement to the 60-year-old dispute between their two peoples.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must dismantle " terrorist infrastructures " and Israel must end its colonization activities, Bush said, reminding both sides of their obligations regarding the path to peace they accepted in 2003.
The White House chief stressed that negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would attempt "to conclude a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues, without exception, including core issues."
This designation covers the three main problems at the point of contention between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees expelled from their homes during the 1948 conflict.
Speaking after the American president, Abbas insisted that the upcoming negotiations be "global and deepened" and refer to all aspects of a regulation, citing "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among other things."
Upon his return to the rostrum, Olmert pledged that the upcoming negotiations would be "direct and continuous" and to make "an effort to conclude them in the course of 2008."
Bush set the end of 2008 as the end of the implementation of his Palestinian and Israeli " vision of two states " .
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had obtained a commitment in this sense from Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the beginning of a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, that proposes peace to Israel in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a point of confrontation in the history of the Middle East, more particularly because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects," Prince Saud said in his Arabic newspaper interview with Saudi capitals.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened last Sunday?
As well as each time in this type of events, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation of the General Inspectorate of the French National Police (IGPN), a police car was circulating on Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m., rue Luisa-Miguel, to Villiers-le-Bel.
"He was not on patrol, but on patrol, and was driving at 40-50 km/h, without a rotating headlight," a police source explains.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, "unapproved, i.e. not authorized to circulate on public roads " (read below) and driven by two young people without helmets, was circulating " at full throttle " .
"He hit the police car on the left side, after a breach of the ceda the passage to the right ", specifies the police.
The breathalyzer control practiced on the occupants of the vehicle turned out to be negative.
The condition of the car (front broken, windshield cracked, bumper torn off) testifies to the violence of the crash.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the procurator of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thér<0xC3><0xA8>re de Givry, announced that he had entrusted an investigation into " acts of involuntary manslaughter and denial of assistance " to the IGPN, coddled with the Val-d'Oise Department of Public Security.
In the afternoon, during a press conference, the prosecutor pointed out that the IGPN investigation, at this stage, ruled out the responsibility of the police.
According to the magistrate three witnesses of the accident, understood on Sunday afternoon, confirmed " the version of the policemen, namely that this minimotocycle came relatively quickly to his left ".
Yesterday, a type of groove, undoubtedly caused by the rubbing of the footshoes on the ground, showed that both vehicles had been stuck for the time for the police car to brake.
The vehicles have been confiscated and will be subject to a technical inspection.
The bodies of both victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened right after that?
Yesterday, a rumor circulated quickly through Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the policemen would have left the site very quickly, thus not providing relief to both young people.
The IGPN, being prudent, would also rule out " any serious fault " on this point.
"It's the most difficult aspect of the investigation, which needs more investigation, on which you have to be very cautious," said a police source.
Liberation found an eyewitness to these few moments that have followed the accident.
One of its windows that precisely overlooks the scene.
“We went down at once, with my cousin who is a nurse at the hospital, to try to resuscitate them,” says this witness.
There was nothing to do.”
Then he saw " a police officer completely terrified, limping.
Two others were trying to resuscitate one of the young men, the room was talking on the phone.”
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and, it seems, with the certainty that people were present of the unexpected situation of the young people, the policemen have been taken by car by colleagues who had arrived at the site.
According to this witness, the rescuers arrived "about twenty minutes after the policemen left".
They also practiced cardiac massages, in vain.
" I will not suggest that the police did not provide assistance to young people.
These young people have been rescued.
The firefighters arrived immediately.
Everything has been done to try to save them,” the prosecutor stressed.
Tensions rise in Pakistan
Pakistani police on Monday repressed the first demonstrations since the establishment of a state of emergency two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the eastern city of Lahore, nearly 2,000 lawyers protesting against measures taken under the state of emergency have been injured by tear gas grenades used by law enforcement, according to witnesses.
The latter responded with stone-throwing, wounding policemen.
At least 350 lawyers have been arrested.
Scenes similar to Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police charged and injured lawyers.
Many would have been questioned.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court lawyers called for a general strike and announced demonstrations as a result of a wave of some 500 arrests over the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
Streets leading to the Supreme Court were blocked Monday morning to prevent the gathering.
Other demonstrations were reported to have taken place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (north-west).
The lawyers’ movement on Monday picked up the support of the religious parties regrouped in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance whose president “urged the population to send flowers to the judges who spoke out against the state of emergency and the waste to which they were sworn in before Musharraf.”
" The promise of Musharraf no longer fulfills "
The Pakistani Supreme Court is directly concerned by the emergency measure proclaimed on Saturday afternoon.
He was due to rule in the coming days on the legality of President Musharraf’s re-election on 6 October by indirect suffrage.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has been removed and replaced.
“Everything we witness is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the rulings of the Supreme Court,” the judge told The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the head of the army and become a civilian president "values no more" after the establishment of the state of emergency, he told Assistant Minister of Information Tariq Azeem on Monday.
He was expected to leave his military uniform by November 15, the date of the end of his first presidential term.
The assistant minister of information also confirmed that the January elections could be moved.
On the other hand, the Pakistani government denied insistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf had been assigned to residence by his deputy head of the armies.
More than a third of pregnancies remain unplanned.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as unplanned or unexpected births.
Even today, more than one pregnancy in three (36%) is not expected, reveals a study conducted by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the vote of the Neuwirth law that liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as unplanned or unexpected births.
Different methods of contraception such as the pill or the sterilet still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, estimates Ined.
The liberalization of contraception allowed however a better "control of fertility", according to the institute that notes that the rate of pill use among women from 20 to 44 years has gone from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
At last, eight out of ten births would be well planned today.
Even calculated little more or less per month for a couple out of five and if possible for spring, season judged as the most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
It will have taken astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crewmates from the International Space Station (ISS) more than seven hours of work in space to carry out the spectacular repair of a torn solar panel and indispensable for the continuation of the scientific activities of the station.
A risky exit that accumulated the records because of its duration, its distance from the habitable modules, the speed with which it has been imagined, instruments "punched" by the astronauts to carry out the repair.
The problem appeared on Tuesday when the astronauts had released from the shuttle Discovery the module Harmony, a thick cylindrical piece in charge of hosting soon the European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is a type of landing platform for the laboratory modules.
We need to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was to move a module of electricity production with solar panels weighing 17.5 tons, already present on the ISS, in order to put it in its final position.
After having moved it, the crew began the reorganization of the solar panels of the module that have a wingspan of 76 meters.
And it is where one of the panels, which unfold like accordions, has been damaged in a little more or less than a meter by a cable that was jammed.
The deployment has been stopped so as not to damage the panel further.
The astronauts, who had initially to make a control exit from the shuttle Discovery, and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it is Scott Parazynski who has been chosen to go to snail at the end of the 30 meters long remote control arm of the shuttle added to that of the station to carry out the repair.
It is one of NASA's best spacewalkers.
Tall, strong, very skilled, has a very developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, this training doctor has been commissioned to "operate" the "wounded" solar panel.
After having precisely inspected the damage, he cut the fallible cable and installed types of "tablets" in the damaged area.
He had been helped by the second " spacewalker " who had stayed near the airlock and, from the inside, by other astronauts such as Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini-hockey stick wrapped with an isolator to prevent electrocution on solar panels that produced several hundred volts, has been conceived and “punched” by astronauts aboard the station.
Once the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before taking inventory of his instruments and returning to the interior of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts were taking advantage of a midday rest before today, seven astronauts return from the Discovery shuttle for the return to Earth scheduled for Wednesday.
EADS Title Sanctioned on the Stock Exchange
EADS shares are currently in sharp decline on the Paris Stock Exchange, after the aeronautics and defence group announced it will have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to cope with delays on the A400M.
EADS loses 4% to 21.96 euros currently on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group has been forced to revise its operational result forecast for 2007 in response to delays engendered by the slow progression of the A400M engine development, which conditions the aircraft’s maiden flight.
The cost to alleviate the delay in the delivery of the military transport aircraft, announced in October, amounts "between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros of which more than 1 billion for Airbus ", announced the parent company of the European manufacturer EADS.
Due to these charges, EADS will be forced to announce new operating profit (EBIT) targets for 2007 during the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, it adds without any further precision.
The group also indicates that the estimate of new charges is consistent with the six-month delay.
It should be recalled that EADS’ operating result failed by 86 % in 2006, mainly due to burdens linked to delays from another programme, that of the very thick A380 carrier.
Initially, the group planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of status quo
No surprise on Sunday, at the exit of the polls: the Russians will massively opt for the party of President Putin, United Russia.
Confirming his aspiration for stability, even authoritarianism, after a very limited campaign.
Three days before the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today sends a televised message to voters about public broadcasters, already registered but whose content is kept secret.
He does so as the leader of the list for United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory proves overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president allowed nothing to transpire by welcoming foreign ambassadors, contenting himself with delivering a new charge against the West accused of meddling – his theme of predilection during the campaign.
"We know the price of a true democracy and we want honest, more transparent and more open elections, elections without incidents," he added.
According to the opposition, we are far from the truth.
He denounces a campaign marred by pressure.
Communist leader Gennady Ziuganov says there have never been "so dirty elections, even in Yeltsin's time".
After the repression of the demonstrations last weekend, former chess world champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstration, visits are prohibited according to his lawyer.
"The Russians kept the mentality of the Soviet homo"
Behind these unsurprising legislative elections are two much more open questions:
Who will succeed Putin as president?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, March 2, 2008; the candidates have until December 23 to make themselves known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot run for a third consecutive term.
Then no successor emerges.
What role will Putin play after March?
The Prime Minister?
Head of the parliamentary majority and the very powerful United Russia party that would elect the government and the president?
Whatever it is, in legislative and presidential elections, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians kept the mentality of homo sovieticus, they do not feel masters of their destiny," estimates sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent center Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov, of St. Petersburg State University, goes back further: civil society lagged in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; the famous spirit of the community delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, “Putin re-established the model of a paternalistic state, perfectly accepted by the population since this new paternalism has not been followed by terrorism, but by a certain economic relief,” estimates Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians " give up of their own free will the personal responsibility " of those who had briefly proved themselves after the break-up of the USSR.
"Why reflect?"
The phenomenon touches all social layers, including the world of affairs.
And the administrative elite plans to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 heads of Russian regions) head the local lists of united Russia.
The new freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
Opinion prefers stability.
The Russians will not vote for the extremists.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, 54-year-old professor: "Why reflect?
Those in power aren’t too bad, why change them?”
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of secrecy, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which describe the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are freely accessible.
The 47 million archive documents, stored on 27 km of shelves in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were not so far searchable only for a "humanitarian" purpose, that is, individually and nominally, at the request of a former victim or his heirs.
The eleven states in charge of its management – such as Germany, France, Israel and the United States – agreed in May 2006 to open them up to seekers and historians.
Since the process of ratification of this agreement by all States has been completed, the opening is effective as of yesterday.
Sensitive information
Historians’ access to Bad Arolsen will make it possible to search “particularly on the movements of prisoners, the population of camps and the state of health of forced workers,” explains Reto Meistern, the director of these archives managed by the International Commission of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, a number of States, such as Germany, had opposed the opening to the public of these nominative documents, owing to the sensitive nature of certain information.
As well as the supposed homosexuality or mental handicap of certain victims of deportation.
The records of the concentration camps or of the arrest warrants issued by the Gestapo had been gathered after the war for a practical purpose: to find the citizens deported or subjected to compulsory work and, eventually, to provide them with proof of their internment, in order to open the way to their compensation.
Even today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees process tens of thousands of individual requests.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
"There is nothing fundamentally new to expect from these documents," said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Research Centre on Antisemitism at the Technische Universit<0xC3><0xA4>t Berlin in 2006.
The European Union and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
Currently, bilateral Indo-European trade already reaches about 60 billion euros per year.
The European Union is India’s largest trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India expect to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, said EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath.
The European Union's foreign ministers had given their approval to the European Commission in April to start negotiations to sign free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The European Union is India’s largest trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the European Union’s 9th trading partner, according to European Commission figures.
"A free trade agreement will dope both economies a lot" and "India would improve its entry into a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans", said Peter Mandelson.
Europe represents the first or the second market for each of the first ten products exported by India, said the European Commissioner. The Asian and European giants exchange annually for " 47 billion euros of goods " and for " ten billion euros of services ", had declared this week Dani<0xC3><0xA8>le Dura European Union President. Dani<0xC3><0xA8>le European President, Prime Minister of the European Commission presence in New Delhi, feeling that bilateral trade "has not yet reached its potential".

Bank of England takes note of concerns offering <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion in five weeks
The Bank of England on Thursday was concerned about easing the current turnaround of credit concerns, and announced a <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion bid at the 5.75% base rate in five weeks, an offer of an unusual duration.
“To alleviate concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in how they will organize their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its planned reserve contribution during the maintenance period beginning on December 6 in the form of an open market operation over five weeks,” the bank said in a statement.
The bank says 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be put on the market as well on December 6 at 12:15 GMT, at the base index and until January 10.
It is the first time that the Bank of England BoE appears to put liquidity on the market for five weeks in an open market operation.
These are usually done within a week.
The BoE adds in its communiqué that it is " prepared to take further measures to keep interbank loan indices up to date with its base index.
The interbank daily index was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The index after three months was set at 6.6 percent, the highest since Sept. 18.
Since the start of the summer financial crisis, the sums put on the market by the Bank of England were combined with a major penalty rate that had deterred banks from resorting to it.
According to certain rumors, corroborated by the evolution of the exchange rate of the pound in relation to the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the sums brought to the market by the European Central Bank, to the most advantageous indices and with a more assured discretion.
UMP and NC parties deny examination of PS party proposals on purchasing power
The UMP group and the Nouveau Centre refused on Thursday to discuss articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which amounts to a rejection of the text.
Inscribed in a socialist "niche" (session for the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined a dozen measures adopted on Tuesday by the national office of the PS among which the increase of 50% of the bonus for employment, the restoration of the floating TIPP (internal tax for petroleum products), a transport check or restrictions on rents.
Since UMP and NC have voted against consideration of the articles (180 votes to 115), the session has been adjourned at the end of the general discussion that led to exchanges, sometimes alive, between majority and opposition to some hours of the televised intervention of Nicolas Sarkozy on purchasing power.
The leader of the PS deputies Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the integrity of his proposals in the form of amendments to the amending finance bill considered by the Assembly next week.
A new festival comes to light
As a result of numerous rumors regarding the creation, by C3 Presents, of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with Festival Republic of the British producer Melvin Benn.
“For our company, it’s an honor to work with a person who inspired, no less than, the current festival movement in America,” C3’s Charlie Jones told Billboard.com.
C3 produces Chicago’s Lollapalooza festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer camping destination.
The festival would take place Aug. 8-10 on a 500-acre private farm approximately 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Formerly known as Mean Fiddler, Festival Republic director Melvin Benn is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took the helm of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts about 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio then, in 2006, the Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival at Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organisation of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Calling Glastonbury the “most inspiring event” he has ever attended, C3’s Charlie Jones says his company and Melvin Benn’s are working in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
“We had chosen Philadelphia as a market and were working persistently with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a downtown Philadelphia festival,” says Charlie Jones.
" We were in negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
“Unfortunately, we are stuck in low-level politics because of the current administration,” Charlie Jones said.
“Fortunately, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we prepared to create a magnificent festival on an exceptional site that will ultimately take place in Philadelphia.”
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at Chicago’s Grant Park, having demarcated itself in the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded respective gross revenues of $9.8M and $11.3M in 2007.
These two festivals take place in an urban environment.
“Melvin Benn’s European model is a country festival, while ours are more in urban green spaces,” says Charlie Jones.
The goal is to merge, in one way or another, both formulas to give both an impression of country festival to the European way and urban to the American way. "
Vineland is roughly halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The Vineland community, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports the celebration of this event,” says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, but states " that they are interesting enough to allow investing in such an event and hosting a festival that, we hope, will have a long life. "
Charlie Jones says that the hotel offer of this festival is "very large", as the example of the 80,000 people of the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that invitations have been issued to the groups, but that nothing could yet be confirmed at the time of going under the press.
“Vineland will have the taste of rock, but the music will be varied there, hoping to attract all kinds of spectators,” says Charlie Jones.
His fellow C3, who received the Top Independent Promoter award at the last Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces the Terminator
It’s not easy to lure Hollywood movie plates to Montreal when nothing but Terminator opposes that...
This mission of seduction is part of the functions of delegate.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger denounces "runaway productions".
Is it difficult to compete with the "Governor"?
“You have to be careful, it’s the industry that decides where it goes.
If you find that conditions in Montreal are favorable, you will go there.
Our role is to offer the ones that will judge the best,” he says.
The Race to the Festivals
At the moment, Denis Turcotte’s priority is nevertheless the promotion of cinema here.
The race to the Oskars is on.
All festivals on the West Coast, be it Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will have to present Quebec films, give them value and ensure that filmmakers do interviews.
The Dark Ages had a good image at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a year-end rally on the stock market? The experts, divided by the 'subprime' crisis.
With less than five weeks until the end of the year, investors are already rubbing their hands waiting for the traditional year-end rally to arrive.
However, this year the experts are not so clear that this is going to happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December on the stock market usually has a positive behavior.
However, it is not advisable to make forecasts based exclusively on statistics, especially because in the current context, uncertainties lurk in the markets, at least in the short term.
Although they are not in favor of the stock market taking a beating in the last weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the stock market is sustained by the existence of liquidity, willing to invest given the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the fleeing effect towards quality values in both long and short sections".
Therefore, they believe that the stock market will have a rather lateral behavior, not exempt from volatility "especially because the impact of the probable decline in the Fed's rates is not known, given the high level of crude oil and the danger of stimulus from inflationary tensions".
Javier Barrio, head of BPI sales in Spain, agrees that this is not a good time to venture out and say that there will be a rally.
“It’s not the case for a lot of joy,” says the expert.
The Ibex has lost about 4% since the highs set on November 8 when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
However, not all experts have such a negative view.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes that the Ibex 35 could close the year closer to 16,000 points thanks to the restructuring of the portfolios and the traditional contributions to the pension plans that occur every year at this time.
However, the expert qualifies that things will be somewhat different this year as he believes that the rally will be ahead of the second week of December, after the bridge of the Constitution.
The analyst does not consider that volatility will affect the market trend.
For his part, Federico Olucha, analyst at Inversis Banco, appreciates that we are close to technical levels and "therefore we could see a rebound of the index that could be boosted depending on the news coming from the US regarding the consequences of the crisis in the credit market".
The analyst is confident that these are positive.
Analysts agree when choosing the values that will be responsible for taking the Ibex to new maximum levels.
Solana, of Intermoney, says that "this year it's up to the big values".
The expert would include in the portfolio the two big banks and some construction companies "because when the date arrives, the electricity sector will be very expensive".
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha, of Inversis Banco, says that the increases will come from the banks and the industrial sector.
Builders will also be able to benefit from this rally, should it occur.
“ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we expect other construction companies such as Ferrovial and FCC to follow the same path,” explains the expert.
Cyclical consumption will be the protagonist in the latter part of the year due to the increase in sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology will also do very well although in this case there is not much representation in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, only twice has December been a bearish month.
The real year-end rally was lived in 2003, an exercise in which stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the puncture of the technological bubble.
This year, in which the Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, December registered a rebound of 6.68%.
We will have to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of profits (for the moment the Ibex rises by 8.36% since January) and if it manages to count on its year-end rally.
Popular will open 200 offices 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
Popular has decided to renovate a large part of its offices.
In total 200, located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Popular Max brand, represent a major change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish entities, since it is the first group that decides to take the leap to bet on the uninterrupted opening of its agencies until 20.30 in the afternoon, and open on Saturdays from 10 am to 20.30 in the afternoon.
Another group that has also reiterated on several occasions that it wanted to extend the hours of its branches, BBVA, has not yet decided to take the step.
Meanwhile, it is about to close a deal with unions to close 75% of its offices on Saturdays in exchange for opening one afternoon, though not to the public.
The results of the Popular experience will be decisive for other entities to sign up or not to this initiative that follows the schedules of the shops.
This is precisely the goal that Popular pursues with the project.
Capture private customers who move through these areas to make their purchases, to SMEs, self-employed and shops of the streets chosen to open.
The bank wants to have these 200 offices open throughout Spain in about 18 months, since they are not new openings but remodeling of the existing ones.
For this, the entity will modernize the branches it already has in commercial areas, adapting them to the profile presented by the customers of the different streets.
In this way, the extension of the hours is accompanied by a different conception of the space of the branch and a new design, more current, with brighter colors.
The head of commercial banking, <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivera, says that this restructuring does not involve a large investment, although a greater hiring of staff, since it goes from having about six employees per premises to eight or nine.
The offices, which will even have spaces for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its initiative in three offices in Madrid.
And the experience has been positive, according to <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivero.
The branches of Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran V<0xC3><0xAD>a streets in Madrid have been chosen, and it seems that with success, according to Rivero.
Popular currently has 2,500 branches.
And another 60 that operate under the Mundocredit brand, specialized in immigrants, also with very wide schedules, which even open on Sundays and holidays.
In these PopularMax locations they will not repeat the BBVA model, where several of their offices have a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
“We don’t want to compete with our customers,” Rivero says.
At the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica to sell mobile phones, with staff external to the bank.
Telecinco doubles for the first time the stock market value of its rival Antena 3
We've made it.'
With that phrase yesterday expressed his satisfaction Paolo Vasile, CEO of Telecinco, at the close of the market, when he found that the chain he runs doubled the value of its rival, Antena 3.
Only one aspect tarnished his joy: 'it is what hurts me, not because we have grown more but because we have come down less,' he said.
Still, he stressed that in a weak market, “we have fallen less.”
Telecinco ended the day yesterday with an advance of 2.54%.
That profit puts its loss in what we have been doing for the year at 15.66%.
The value on the stock market of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and held by Vocento (another 13%) thus reaches 4,488.88 million euros, according to Bloomberg data.
Its rival Antena 3, which yesterday gave up 1.52% and accumulated a drop of 40.5% since January, costs half, 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other listed communication companies amounts to 3.571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2.518.53 million Prisa (publisher of Cinco D<0xC3><0xAD>as) and 1.779 million Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is because 'we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do, in the same market, at what cost and how we monetize it in terms of audience.”
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become the first television network this year to exceed 1 billion gross advertising revenues, according to Giuseppe Tringali, the CEO of Telecinco and Publiespa<0xC3><0xB1>a, the subsidiary that manages the group's advertising.
If this announced data becomes real, the television network would record this year an increase of 3.6% in its advertising turnover compared to 965.4 million in 2006.
On the other hand, Antena 3’s net turnover increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (to reach 734.4 million) while television’s net revenues grew by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that point analysts to the best relative evolution on the Telecinco stock exchange is the high pay out that it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a distributed 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile says that, although it is early to make the decision, this ratio could vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol in association with its parent Mediaset.
"We have an official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always stated much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to please our shareholders, who we have already valued with 33% of Endemol.
According to analysts, the market is showing signs of some fatigue at the moment.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its profit estimates on Telecinco in 2008 by 4% and in 2009, by 7%.
It is due, they explain, to the fact that projected revenue growth has been cut from 10.5 per cent to 8.4 per cent in 2008 and from 5.5 per cent to 5.1 per cent in 2009.
This same firm has lowered the profit forecast of Antena 3 by 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.

Congress approves the transposition of the Mifid, which entered into force 1 November
In parallel to its parliamentary procedure, which ended today with the vote by the Congress of the amendments incorporated into the bill in the Senate, the Government has submitted to a public hearing the regulations that will develop the new law, with the aim that both enter into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the different groups agreed to highlight the effort made by deputies and senators to negotiate and agree on the best regulations in order to guarantee the protection of investors and regulate in detail the activity of the entities so that the markets work efficiently.
The MIFID, which modifies the Securities Market Law, involves the modernization of financial markets, while strengthening investor protection, improving the supervisory powers of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promoting cooperation between the various supervisors of the European Union.
The new regulation will allow the provision of financial advisory services to both specialized firms and natural or legal persons and creates a new type of financial services firms (ESIS), financial advisory companies (AFIs), which join securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, it expands the number of systems for the execution of transactions on financial instruments, so that regulated secondary markets are added to multilateral trading systems and order internalization systems, which will compete with current exchange managers.
The Act also requires investment firms to disclose information on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and risk management practices to the market and requires them to keep a record of all transactions they undertake, to facilitate oversight by the CNMV.
In its passage through the Economy Committee of Congress, several modifications were incorporated, among which it stands out that the securitised debts are considered as a "complex" financial instrument given their high danger to the investor, which has been demonstrated with what happened with the debt of US subprime mortgages (subprime).
In addition, the transposition of the directive was used to legally delimit the functions that can be performed by graduates in Economics and Business 30 years after the Royal Decree that delimits the professional functions reserved for economists was approved in 1977.
For its part, the Senate incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as the mediator, who will work for others, will not require the authorization of the CNMV and will be able to provide its product marketing and customer acquisition services to different investment companies at the same time.
Harmonized CPI rises five-tenths in November to 4.1%
This indicator, which is then used by Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides an advance on how prices evolved in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) to provide data comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The advance indicator is calculated using the same procedure as that used for the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate information not yet available at the time of publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advance indicator is only indicative, so it does not necessarily coincide with the final data, which will be released on December 14.
“The CPI will continue at relatively high levels.”
Second Vice President and Minister of Economy, Pedro Solbes, has said that the rise in 4.1% of the CPI in November is a "temporary figure", but at the same time he has predicted that the price index will continue at "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes has pointed out in the halls of Congress that "even if the figure is not good" the inflation differential of Spain with respect to the monetary union remains "more or less" the same as in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there was less surprise" than in the previous month, when the government did not have such a high rise.
"We expected a figure of around 4%," said the Minister of Economy regarding the figure advanced today.
Virgin plans to raise $42 billion from Northern Rock in three years
Northern Rock’s deposits have fallen more than 50% to <0xC2><0xA3>12 billion since it went into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from the Bank of England.
At the time, it was amassing record deposits of more than <0xC2><0xA3>25 billion, a figure that has fallen progressively in two and a half months due to the distrust of its customers and despite the guarantee of one hundred percent of that money offered by the Government and which it will maintain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which would rebrand the entity as Virgin Money, needs to capture around a quarter of the revenue at British banks that will be deposited over the next three years to raise the remaining <0xC2><0xA3>18 billion to reach the <0xC2><0xA3>30 billion target.
The group of tycoon Richard Branson, known for his eye-catching advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) annually on advertising and marketing to achieve its purpose.
Northern Rock this week named the Virgin consortium’s bid, involving three other companies, as its favorite to bail it out of bankruptcy.
The mayor of Totana arrested for alleged urban corruption plot
The Civil Guard has arrested today early in the morning the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana (of the Popular Party) for his alleged relationship with the plot of urban corruption uncovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the consistory and the chief of police of the municipality have also been arrested.
José Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez Andreo replaced last May Juan Morales, current popular deputy, and until then councilor of the municipality, and according to research sources consulted by Cadena SER, could be the 'head' of this plot.
The agents continue to register the municipal units and the Ministry of Urban Planning and no more arrests are ruled out in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales, the main suspect in the plot of urban corruption uncovered earlier this week, has been charged.
As the Cadena SER reported yesterday, the lawyer of the 'popular' deputy Juan Morales, therefore capacitated, was stopped leaving the home of Morales with important documentation related to the plot.
Moreover, the object of the investigation, according to sources of the investigation, is the alleged collection of commissions from Morales in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a Galician construction company to redevelop 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, eight people have been arrested.
Bono agrees to lead the candidacy of the PSOE for Toledo and preside over the Congress if they win the elections.
Former Defense Minister José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and General Secretary of the Socialists, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero, to head the list of the PSOE for Toledo for the next general elections and to be president of the Congress in the event that the Socialists win the general elections.
This was announced at a press conference by the Secretary of Organization of the PSOE, José Blanco, and Bono himself, after the meeting held this noon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The head of the Executive has justified the offer to the former minister because "it is important to have the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
In addition, he has pointed out that "it seems" that the politician from La Mancha will be the candidate of the socialist group to preside over the Congress if the socialists win in the next elections.
Bono would replace as president of Congress Manuel Mar<0xC3><0xAD>n, who made public on November 15 his decision not to stand for the next general election and to abandon his career in active politics to dedicate himself to fighting climate change in the university environment.
The former minister has acknowledged that the President of the Government has not stopped insisting that he return to the political vanguard since he left it two years ago.
In addition, he pointed out that, just as citizens know who will be the economic vice president if the PSOE wins the elections, his party has wanted to announce who will preside over the Congress, in an "act of transparency".
If he takes office, Bono hopes to turn the House into “the house of respect and not of insult or yelling” and make it “look more and more like citizens.”
"Sometimes unfortunately it seems that the only place in Madrid where you can not speak with tranquility and calm is the Congress, the president of the Government on one occasion was interrupted in the Senate 26 times."
Likewise, he has had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Mar<0xC3><0xAD>n and "his good work" and has not wanted to be seen already occupying his position so as not to fall into what, as he has pointed out, his opponents could see as "prepotency".
Climate Propaganda
Since the climate change movement mercilessly persecutes both the skeptics of its predictions and those who prioritize other political and social battles, it is bound to show an iron coherence.
And more a leader of the movement who is president of the Government like Zapatero and believes that this fight is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and even intends to sign a "new contract with the planet".
That approach forces him to explain why his government’s action, or inaction, has contributed decisively to Spain leading the EU in non-compliance with Kyoto.
Who is responsible for the breach, in which sectors it has occurred and why his government, that of the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
In addition, it requires him to explain with maximum clarity to the Spaniards what are the measures he will take to curb climate change.
What companies will be affected, what citizens’ habits will have to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings we will be obliged to make, what economic consequences it will have.
That is, who will sacrifice and who will pay to save the planet.
But there have been and will be no such explanations.
Precisely because it is a question of sacrificing and paying.
The measures against climate change, the real measures, are unpopular.
Expensive, inconvenient and threatening to the accounts of companies and individuals.
Even the penny of gasoline suggested by the PSOE has seemed so electorally dangerous to Zapatero that he hastened to deny it.
In other words, it is a question of saving the planet with nothing, with pure propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With shocking phrases, commissions, committees, protocols, new positions.
With contracts with the planet, that gentleman so useful for electoral campaigns that he neither speaks nor denounces nor demands, but adorns the rallies and inspires tenderness.
Provided that it is limited to being a purely virtual contracting party and does not intend that we travel by bicycle or refresh ourselves with the fan.
The mayor and the head of the local police of Totana arrested for an alleged plot of urban corruption
The Civil Guard has arrested the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the "popular" José Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez Andreo, the head of the local Police, the secretary of the City Council and a hospitality entrepreneur for possible urban crimes, sources of the investigation said today.
The mayor was arrested at his home and has been transferred to the Consistory, in whose dependencies he is currently together with numerous agents, who have also gone to the Department of Urbanism and the municipal company for the management of Industrial Land and Housing.
These three arrests are in addition to the six made last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation related to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of rustic land in urbanizable so that the Galician company Nuaria built 4,000 homes, after the payment of illegal commissions during the last legislature.
In addition, two other people were not arrested but are charged in the summary, which instructs the Court number 1 of Totana.
The first six detainees have been taken to court today.
According to the sources, the former councilor of Totana and now an autonomous parliamentarian of the PP, Juan Morales, is being investigated.
In addition, the former woman, owner of a real estate agency registered today in Totana, has been charged, as has the current girlfriend of the former councilor, who resides in Murcia capital.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and businessman Manuel N.A. from Vigo, was arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as was Pablo José M.G., director of Soelo de Inmonuar, an agency integrated into the aforementioned Group, through which the bribes would have been made.
The investigation is carried out by the Urban Crime Group of the Central Operational Unit (UCO) of the Civil Guard, whose agents, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven searches, most of them in companies related to the detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
A single person was then arrested in Totana, specifically the owner of a well-known poultry products company in the region, who could have acted as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was in charge of developing what would be the largest residential complex in the Murcian municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 homes, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company acquired in Totana 2.2 million square meters of land that were requalified and its project would double the population of the municipality, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group includes companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, dedicated to real estate development; Conycase, which manages the Vigo car parks on Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a streets, Venezuela and Plaza de Fernando el Cat<0xC3><0xB3>lico; Hogartel, dedicated to the direct marketing sector; Preconiza, focused on the promotion, sale and installation of construction elements.

Our Finnish correspondent provides us with this comment yesterday in the most important newspaper in Finland (by the way at the head of the PISA report on educational level in the world), the Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day that there appeared, curiously, the criticism of Blackburn’s book:
"The content of the signature of Philosophy has jumped to public opinion as a result of the tragedy of the school of Jokela.
The culprit of the deaths, a high school student, cited in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
From the pages of the Helsingin Sanomat newspaper, Pekka Elo, the Councillor for Education in charge of the subject of Philosophy, demanded that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Plato and affirmed that studying Nietzsche is not essential in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in institutes.

A colleague gives information on the introduction in the Criminal Code of crimes on Internet downloads:
A. Downloading a song would be a criminal offence with a penalty of six months to one year.
On the other hand, if you steal discs worth less than 400 euros in the store, it is considered simply missing (article 623.1).
B. If you steal up to 1,000 euros in the store, the theft is already a crime, but the penalty is still lower than the one imposed on the discharge (article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty is still less than the discharge (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the exchange of compacts.
Participating in a tumultuous quarrel is punishable by three months to one year (article 154 of the Penal Code) and the exchange would be punishable by six months to two years
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a movie on DVD, according to article 184.2 of the Criminal Code.
F. The distribution of films protected by copyright and without the authorization of the authors is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (art. 186).
Anyway, if my colleague is right, someone's hand is going away, a very long hand.

My family doctor has written me an article about rare research entitled: 'Money causes brain activations, especially if others receive less'.
That is, the feelings generated by the monthly pay of the workers depends on what the colleagues earn.
The study has been performed using tomographic magnetic resonance imaging at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the Neurocognition Imaging group at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: "The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his partner failed."
The researchers observed that if both hit the same pay, the activation was moderate, but if one received double, the activation was greater.
I don't know if it required that much science.
The Prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly prosecuting war criminals in the Balkans for eight years from the prosecution office of the Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, located in The Hague.
His term ends at the end of the year and Carla will leave with a bittersweet taste, because the main perpetrators of the Srebrenica massacre - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were killed -, former General Ratko Mladic and former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, are still at large.
Their names are on that list from which the documentary by Swiss filmmaker Marcel Sch<0xC3><0xBC>pbach takes its title, ‘Carla’s List’ (2006, not released in Spain) which, with the rhythm of a police thriller, follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York to pursue the fugitive criminals and pressure the governments involved to tighten the siege.
What insurance is right for me?
Car insurance, which covers the driver in case of possible claims, involves a significant expense that will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, the age of the card, marital status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use of it, among others.
Having a car is just the beginning.
Choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
First of all, we need to be clear about what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insured.
This commitment is embodied in an insurance contract, which states that the company receives the value of the agreed premium in exchange for being responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a claim.
The premium is the price of the insurance, which is established taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, the age of the card, marital status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use given to it, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices based on statistics, so that the more likely you are to suffer an accident, the higher the fee to be paid.
It is for that reason that both those over 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, since statistics reflect that they have a lower accident rate due to their prudence.
In addition, companies have concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use given to the vehicle will influence the frequency, and with it the probability of having some type of mishap.
Increasing the frequency increases the odds.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when setting the premium price.
That is why, the driver must study the situation well to choose the car insurance that best fits his profile.
We will expose here the most significant variables when choosing one or another type of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insured, offers a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 face several disadvantages when it comes to taking out insurance at an affordable price, such as limited driving experience and the age of the card.
Although the ideal to be well insured is an all-risk insurance, there are other cheaper options.
The most cautious drivers can opt for an all-risk with franchise, so that they get the coverages of an all-risk insurance but at a more feasible price.
This type of agreement would mean that the customer pays a part of the amount of the claim.
"The part of the amount of the claim that the customer contributes will be pre-established based on the value of the premium, which will be higher the lower the amount", specifies Luis Noguera, head in Spain of First Europa, online insurance mediator.
Another option is an extended third-party insurance, so that the customer ensures protection against damage caused to third parties, but not against those caused in their own car.
In addition, it would be covered for theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
A word of advice.
If you are under 25 years old, try to be careful and avoid claims as much as possible, as this will affect the bonus, and may reduce the cost of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction on the base rate owned by the company.
In contrast, a penalty is a surcharge on that base fee.
"Bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and the company's profit.
If the company has had a good year, it can afford to increase the bonuses,” Noguera said.
After the age of 25, drivers have it easier to take out insurance, since the accident rate is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
For this reason, it is best to take an all-risk franchise.
"Normally young people can not make use of the experience previously acquired when making use of an accident, and even when driving," says the director in Spain of the European company, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of driving, once the 'fear of the novice' has passed.
However, if the client is married but does not yet have children it is preferable that he negotiates insurance at all risk, as long as his economic situation allows it, of course.
On the other hand, marriages with children are considered by insurers as the public with the lowest accident rate, so the surcharges will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be an all-risk insurance with a deductible (this could be 300 euros), or, when a high level of bonus is available, one to third parties extended from the third year of life of the vehicle.
“They have a more relaxed driving style and they have more purchasing power to afford to take on a larger franchise amount,” says Luis Noguera.
For retirees it is recommended an all-risk insurance with franchise (being this one of 150 euros), or one to third parties extended when you have a high level of bonus.
It must be said that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver in case of possible claims, but also because it represents an important expense, which is why it is essential to properly study the insurance that best suits us according to our personal situation.
Celtic are looking for a point in Milan that is worth the eighth.
Milan and Celtic are measured this Tuesday in San Siro in search of the point that they lack to achieve their respective objectives in the closing of the league of the 'Champions', since the Italians serve to be first and the Scots to sentence their classification.
The Italians have ten points and already certified in the fifth round their pass with a draw in Portugal, while Celtic has nine points, but still needs another to ensure that Shakhtar, with six, and that receives Benfica, who has four, does not ahead.
These two matches of Group D will be played one week before the end of the sixth day, as Milan has to play the Club World Cup in Japan, where it debuts on the 13th in the semifinals in search of a place for the final of the 16th.
Thus, this group will be closed before the rest and the draw at Giuseppe Meazza seems the most expected result, although the two teams will try to go for a victory, since the Italians will not want to speculate at home and Celtic knows that winning would be first and would ensure a better cross in the eighth.
Gordon Strachan's side could even qualify for a defeat if Shakhtar do not win, but it cannot be trusted because at nine points the pass is for the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanistas will try to embitter the night to the Scots, who hope to get into the round of 16 for the second time in the restructured Champions League and consecutively, after they were defeated in that round last season with a goal by Kaka in the extra time (1-0) after the 0-0 of the first leg.
Waiting for the victory of the 'rossoneri' will be the Shakhtar who is only worth the victory, in the event that Celtic lose, both to get into the round of 16 and to continue in UEFA.
And is that Benfica, despite being last and without options to continue in the top European competition, could reach third place with a victory, with what would play UEFA.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls tour in Vancouver
The Spice Girls have kicked off their first tour since disbanding in 2000 in Vancouver, Canada, in front of about 20,000 spectators.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) declared shortly before starting their concert at Vancouver's GM Place stadium that the group's reunion is "brilliant".
About 20,000 people sold out to watch the concert, which included a video telling the story of the group that made a splash in the late 1990s.
The reunion and the world tour coincide with the release of a new album that includes their main hits as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which EMI publishes in Spain.
The five Spice Girls members took to the stage wearing bracelets given to them by 'Posh Spice's' husband, British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was among the crowd cramming the GM Place, even though Victoria’s nerves had barred him days earlier.
Beckham said the British star "hasn't seen our costumes at all, so I'm nervous about what he's going to think of the show."
Sporty Spice, whose departure from the group in 1998 "because of the differences between us" caused the dissolution of the quintet two years later, also expressed his nervousness during a meeting with the press, two hours before the start of the show.
“I was scared.
I was nervous but I saw that the feeling of the world has changed, the feeling for the Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, so I’m glad I made the decision,” Chisholm said of the group’s reunion she disbanded nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time, "things have been fixed and we all love each other very much."
But much has changed since the Spice Girls last performed together in 1998.
For starters, according to CTV television, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines plane.
Upon arrival at the airport, an army of nannies was waiting for them.
Among the five are seven children.
Following the Vancouver concert, the group will perform in California (USA), San Jose (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
They will perform in Madrid on December 23.
New fears over gas between Russia and Ukraine
The growing dispute over the price of gas between Ukraine and Russia, increases the risk of it affecting the export of fuel to Western Europe by Russia.
Most of the gas exported by Russia to the European Union (EU) is directed through Ukraine, so every brush between the two nations is a source of attention.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price of gas, Russia will have to pay higher transit rates.
An earlier dispute last year reduced supplies to EU states.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscow came with the Ukrainian government and the Russian state, monopoly gas owner Gazprom, trying to agree on the amount of money Ukraine should pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom said it would charge Ukraine more, as it has pledged to pay an extra 50 percent in 2008 for gas coming from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say it could be that Ukraine pays 40% more for Gazprom’s imports.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important transits for gas during the talks," Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinakh told Reuters news agency.
“Changes in gas prices should not be related to our arguments about the levels of transit rates [to western Europe] via Ukraine.”
The last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom cut off supplies to Ukraine in January 2006.
This meant a drop in exports to Western Europe, which quickly raised prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the EU’s supply.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but much of it is not yet fully developed.
As a result, Gazprom supplements its own supply with gas from Turkmenistan and other former Central Asian Soviet nations.
NHS 'must test foreign workers'
The Scottish NHS needs to monitor the criminal records of employees from outside Europe, a watchdog said.
The recommendation by auditor general Robert Black came after a foreign doctor was found to be linked to the Glasgow airport attack in June.
Black also expressed concern that the Scottish NHS has no exact idea of how many foreign staff it has.
However, his report pointed to other checks being carried out correctly through a sample of five health authorities.
The auditor general checked the number of foreign staff hired outside the European Economic Area, following the attacks on Glasgow airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at Paisley’s Royal Alexandra Hospital, was arrested at the airport after a jeep crashed into the doors of the airport’s terminal building.
He was one of three doctors who performed at the Old Bailey by video conference in October, charged in connection with the alleged car bombings in the UK.
The NHS hopes to conduct pre-employment checks on applicants to ensure they meet the qualifications, experience and authorisation to work in the UK.
Although the Scottish Health Board uses “Disclosure Scotland” to conduct criminal background checks, the agency has no jurisdiction to obtain this information outside of Great Britain.
The auditor general’s report recommends, among other measures, that boards should rely on guidance from the Criminal Records Bureau, which helps employers with criminal controls in many countries outside Britain.
“Although we found some of the personal records with evidence of these controls, this is not a routine review,” the report said.
Black states that the Scottish NHS has a high level of compliance with its own employment policies, but notes that: "our report highlights areas that can be improved to ensure that the necessary information is available in the number of foreign NHS staff."
BMA Scotland president Dr Peter Terry said it was “very unlikely” that pre-employment checks could identify potential NHS employees who might commit terrorist acts in the future.
“The report suggests that pre-employment checks work in NHS Scotland but it is not clear what the added value of the recommendations made is,” he explained.
Scottish health authorities say they currently have 1,161 foreign nationals, most of them doctors and nurses.
But the auditor general cautioned that the number may be higher, in part because boards have trouble identifying which employees have indefinite residency permits.
The investigation also found that the verification procedures established by the NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian were being widely complied with.
This includes passport checks, work permit checks and skills checks.
The Scottish Government is currently reviewing the pre-employment policy and guidance of foreigners in the NHS.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: “It was in my great interest that this work be carried out in the wake of the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport.
He added that the Scottish government, in conjunction with the health boards, could consider the recommendations of the reports and that this will be reflected in the updated pre-employment control guidelines for all working groups – including foreigners – which they planned to publish next month.
Joy Division dominates the film awards
Control, the biopic about late Joy Division vocalist Ian Curtis, has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including Best Picture.
The trophies were also given to protagonist Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse until he was cast in the role of Curtis, for director Anton Corbijn and co-star Toby Kebbell.
Actress Judi Dench was named best actress for the thriller "Notes from a Scandal."
And Bond star Daniel Craig won the Variety Award for putting a British film on the international stage.
The awards were presented at a ceremony at London’s Roundhouse.
Control follows Curtis' rise to fame with Joy Division, until his suicide in 1980, at the age of 23.
The black-and-white film, which features soundtracks from The Killers, David Bowie and New Order, was produced for just <0xC2><0xA3>3,000.
Dutch photographer Corbijn, already known for the iconic cover of U2’s Joshua Tree album, won two awards – for best director and best debuting director.
Rock music was the focus of another award-winner at the ceremony — Julien Temple’s film about Clash frontman Joe Strummer won the award for best documentary.
The best actor award went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as a chauffeur for a Russian mob boss in David Cronenberg’s Eastern Promises.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing hard, received the Richard Jarris Award for his contribution to British cinema.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the Indiana Jones sequel “The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.”
Winstone said he was proud to receive the award, named after the Camelot and Harry Potter star Harris, who died in 2002.
“It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors for people like me,” he said.
“I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a couple of times.
He was a great guy, a great actor of our time, it’s really an honor.”
The independent film awards, known as BIFAS, are selected by a team that includes filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Supporters and patrons of the Bifa festival include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia Arrests 208 Terrorists
Saudi Arabia has arrested 208 terrorist cell militants planning an imminent attack on oil facilities, as well as attacks on religious and security forces.
State television of the world's largest oil supplier said one of the cells was planning to smuggle missiles.
Al-Qaeda sympathizers have mounted a campaign against the local monarchy, in alliance with the United States, since 2003 following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants made up of foreign residents was planning an attack on an oil facility in the eastern province, the TV report said.
Saudi Arabia created a force of 35,000 troops to protect the facilities of Abqaiq, the world’s largest oil plant, after a failed al-Qaeda attack in 2006.
The report, citing a statement from the Saudi Interior Minister, said 18 of those arrested belonged to a cell led by a “missile launch expert” who has entered the country.
The minister said the militants had planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the country.
Another 22 of those arrested were planning assassinations of religious leaders and security forces.
The government warned religious leaders that they must be more active in stopping Saudis traveling to Iraq from joining al-Qaeda militants to fight against allied forces and to back the Shia Muslim government, which is considered a heretic by the most extreme Saudi Sunnis.
Al-Qaeda militants are targeting many religious in Saudi Arabia who have been appointed by the authorities to support the policies of the royal family, which dominates the government.
The militants — recruited by calls from Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born leader of al Qaeda, to harass the country’s pro-Western government — targeted government-associated alien residences, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This was a big effort by the security forces, for five months of work," the interior minister's spokesman told state television.
Those arrested also include a 16-person “media cell” in Medina, whose goal was to promote “takfiri thinking” — the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims that supports violence against Muslims considered infidels and apostates.
The arrest includes 32 other people accused of giving support and financial support to the militants.
Venus's climate may give an idea of Earth's future
Venus may once have been an appropriate place for life, scientists said yesterday.
Data from an orbiting European spacecraft showed the planet more closely resembling an Earth twin than had previously been observed.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
The two planets are similar in size and occupy similar orbits, although Venus is slightly closer to the sun.
Millions of years ago, Venus may have had conditions similar to those that made Earth a habitable planet, scientists now believe.
But the effects of carbon dioxide and the greenhouse effect, atmospheric erosion by solar radiation and slower solar rotation sent Venus into a very different kind of development.
Today the planet has no water, the surface temperature is enough to melt lead and is eroded by hurricane winds and lightning storms.
The results from the European Space Agency’s Venus Express, which has been studying the planet for a year, offer a snapshot of how Earth might develop catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor, from the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: “It is becoming clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that on Earth, when they are two planets so similar.
"Our new data make it possible to construct a scenario in which Venus began as Earth, possibly with a habitable environment millions of years ago."
Police confiscate "enriched uranium"
A kilo of radioactive material, which they declare to be enriched uranium, was seized yesterday by Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said three people were arrested and the material was examined.
The cash could not confirm whether it was enriched uranium but said it could have been sold for $1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>480,000).
Still remains open
Mitt Romney says it’s not worthy for presidential candidates to answer a snowman’s questions.
However, Republican presidential candidates eventually agree to hold a debate on YouTube, in which ordinary voters record video questions and send them for dissemination among the candidates.
None of the questions presented Wednesday afternoon were more ridiculous than that of the snowman who asked Democrats about climate warming in the YouTube Republican Party debate.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected a lot of the state of the Republican party ahead of next year’s election.
It’s not known exactly how CNN’s producers, who co-sponsor the debate, chose the YouTube videos to show the would-be candidates.
But the first half-hour of debate, the longest devoted to a single issue, focused on immigration.
The issue is one of the most powerful topics for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of undecided voters to raise the bar when they heard ideas they liked: Broadcasters noticed approval spikes when candidates spoke with extremist arguments.
The night’s toughest word exchanges were between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Mr. Romney, who has been a pointer in the crucial Iowa and New Hampshire polls.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to ruin Romney’s reputation because he was soft on illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former Massachusetts governor of hiring illegal immigrants to work at his home.
Both responded aggressively when asked if any candidate could support an “amnesty” (allowing illegals to regularize their situation and giving them the chance to obtain citizenship).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, got agreement on the issue.
Neither has the word to be nominated, but both remain in the race perhaps because both alerted on the issue of immigration before the others.
At least in immigration, and in general terms, the candidates share views: increased surveillance at the borders, intolerance of illegal immigrants.
This topic, along with fears of toxic toys from China and other concerns abroad, helps Republicans forget, or minimize, divisions between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate turned into uncomfortable when other issues came up.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he had supported gun control in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney debated whether water immersion should be considered torture.
One person asked if the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to stumble toward the position that while the Bible was his favorite book, he did not literally believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another person asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee — now, against all expectations, first and foremost in the most recent Iowa poll, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism — said the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When pressed to answer whether Jesus would be in favor, he laughed that Jesus was too smart to be a candidate in the election.
The race is still unusually open.
Mr. Huckabee ramps up in Iowa, coinciding with liberal Ron Paul’s fundraising campaigns, and his heated statements from Wednesday’s debate.
The two of them have come out from the bottom, because the two wings of the party did not agree on the most famous and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, one candidate united the party early and convincingly with a winning message about America’s greatness, satisfying both wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Dolores Laboristas
Gordon Brown has discovered another hole to sink into; but it still emerges
As political scandals continue in England, this one is not particularly interesting.
No influences seem to have been sold, no exorbitant hotel bills in Paris, no extramarital finger sucking.
But it has been revealed that a wealthy businessman has masqueraded contributions to the British Labour government party of more than 650,000 pounds ($1.3 million) for about four years using false names, and that the party did not report him.
Two months ago, when the prime minister eluded to call an election, stupidly insulting British intelligence by declaring that opinion polls did not influence his decision, the hope was that it would provide a strong and efficient government.
But instead, like Vince Calbe, the liberal democrat leads with increasing ingenuity, because the dreaded Mr. Brown has gone from being Stalin to being Mr. Bean.
The bailout of Northern Rock, a troubled bank, demonstrated regulatory weakness and poor judgment in times of crisis.
Bad proposals to change the tax code has pitted business groups, together, against the government.
The tax authority lost 25 million personal data that revealed an unimaginable administrative blip.
A trio of retired generals started a mutiny in the House of Lords, protesting against cuts in military spending: being ministers of the armed forces is, they claimed, a part-time job.
Now it’s David Abrahams’ multiple donations; Peter Watt, the Labour secretary general (and former accomplice) has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is irrevocably walking toward the exit.
Governments can reach a tipping point after they find themselves unable to govern.
People don’t believe them as politicians, but they usually suspend their disbelief when a new batch takes over.
Once it is clear that the prime minister cannot improve things, that he does not have much time left, that suspension is too much: public officials begin to fail; cabinet ministers expose themselves; the press looks for bad news; and the government gets defensive and does not focus.
On the one hand, Brown’s position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders he cannot defend himself by arguing that he is new.
Although he wanted to disown Tony Blair, he was his senior lieutenant.
The Northern Rock problems and the authority registration tax are related to the decisions Brown made as chancellor of the treasury.
And even though it’s not directly involved in Blairish mishaps — or “partner cash,” the research of political party funding — voters can assume that it is.
However, Mr. Brown’s situation is not as bad as it seems.
The plates aren't as bad as the Tories want to show.
As in Mr. Bean, no one has died, nor has anyone been directly scammed.
And the remedy, though painful, is to give what Mr. Brown’s naturally Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable and brutal government.
The new political scandal of donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, who likens his donations to charitable giving, says he does not want public recognition for his benevolence.
This may be so, but the decision is not made by him.
The laws against anonymity for big political contributors are clear and exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who is buying access to those in power.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew of Mr. Abraham’s deal, and that it was not illegal, will obviously face Jon Mendlesohn, the fundraising chief who was asked about the donations in October.
But Mr. Brown is so far uninvolved: there is nothing to suggest that he knew of these performances, although the bulk of the payments were made after he took control of the office in June.
So far the Prime Minister has done half the work.
He has been quick to condemn his party for breaking the law, but is diluted in decision-making by a family matter, a commission of inquiry into the matter — led, to a large extent, by a judge and a bishop.
In this case, the morals are not complicated.
If the law has been violated, it is a police matter.
In addition, there are other things Mr. Brown must do, such as finding a permanent and independent head for the Standards in Public Life Commission, as he has not had one for six months, and he must also push for genuine reform of party funding.
This will require hard cooperative labour with the Tories, and perhaps a renunciation of the special financial situation with the unions – bitter measures for a partisan like Mr Brown.
But he must face some partisan facts.
The Conservatives now have a good level of support in the polls; he has two years to win voters; and the only way he can move to victory is by acting with impeccable probity and solid competition.
Sharks Cards
Is the subprime mortgage crisis infecting the U.S. credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, it is natural for some dorsal fins to swim excitedly around.
Today when the American housing market is in crisis, predators have their sights set on the country’s credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs estimate that credit card losses could reach $99 million if the subprime mortgage crisis spreads other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of contagion can be seen.
There is an increase in both card charges and crime rates, which measures the proportion of balances that have not been amortized or that are more than 30 days overdue respectively.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken a 1.4 million charge in its American consumer finance business, in part due to weakness in card borrowers.
However, it’s too early for panic.
Delinquency and delinquency are at low levels.
According to Moody’s, a ratings agency, the third-quarter crime rate of 3.89% was nearly one percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
A change in the U.S. personal bankruptcy law (2005) resulted in a sharp drop in bankruptcy applications, which in turn represent a large loss on credit cards; the number of applications (and therefore, delinquency) would be growing again, or it may happen that conditions for borrowers were getting worse.
The industry also reports solid payout rates, which show how much of their debt consumers pay each month.
And confidence in credit cards and asset-backed securities is pretty firm, despite paralysis in other financial areas.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research firm, predicts that issuance volumes for 2007 will be about 25% higher than last year.
The direct channels of infection crisis between subprime mortgages and the credit card market certainly exists: consumers like to charge debts to credit cards now that credit institutions are expiring.
But credit card issuers look more at cash flow than asset values, so falling prices don’t necessarily trigger a change in borrowers’ creditworthiness.
They can even work to outperform the emitters.
Incentives for consumers to continue amortizing the mortgage decrease if properties are worth less than the value of the loan; and as a result, the payment of card debt climbs the priority list.
Card issuers can also respond quickly and flexibly to the difficult conditions that mortgage lenders face, by changing interest rates or altering credit balances.
That in theory should reduce the risk of rapid asset re-assets.
“We’re not going to wake up one day and reassess all the loans,” says Gary Perlin, Capital One’s chief financial officer.
If a sudden subprime infection in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained decline are much more real.
If house prices are lower and a credit crunch pushes America into recession, the industry undoubtedly faces a more severe future.
We need to keep an eye on those dorsal fins.
British Bankers Plead Guilty in Enron Case
Three British bankers who went to trial for their responsibility for fraud with Enron’s former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, were found guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally found not guilty of seven counts of fraud for colluding with Fastow in a secret financial operation in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of employees.
They were sent to trial in January.
But during the hearing before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., each was convicted of fraud collusion.
The three former executives of Greenwich Natwest, a unit of the Scottish PLC group at the Royal Bank, became a cause cél<0xC3><0xA8>bre in Britain for extradition proceedings that lasted two years.
In the United States, his case marks the sluggish end of an investigation launched after the Enron meltdown in 2001.
Initially, the charges against the bankers were that they alerted Fastow in 2002 that he was the target of a government investigation into Enron’s downfall.
The indictment against the bankers — dubbed the “NatWest Three” — alleges that they came to Houston in 2000 to concoct a fraudulent scheme with Fastow and his former top aide, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of an Enron corporation controlled by Fastow, who was the mastermind behind a myriad of frauds at Enron, which helped its spiral into bankruptcy.
In 2002, the bank valued the subsidiary’s interest at zero, but the three Britons knew it would appreciate.
A company under Kopper's control bought the subsidiary's bank interest for $1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for interest in the company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely represented Enron, as the energy company would pay Greenwich NatWest $20 million for its shares of the subsidiary.
But the 20 million was left in the hands of the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers collected $7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received about $12.3 million, according to the indictment.
In January 2004, Fastow was convicted of two counts of conspiracy in the Enron collapse.
The trio of Britons were arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a 6-year sentence in a Louisiana federal prison.
Kopper is serving a three-year, one-month sentence in Texarkana.
Each of the three British bankers was required to pay $1 million to live in the United States while the trial was taking place.
Enron, one of the nation’s seven largest companies, filed for bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks, could not hide debt from millions or make its failing businesses seem successful.
The collapse lost thousands of jobs, more than 60 million in market values and more than two million in pension plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling were indicted last year for their roles in the company’s collapse.
Skilling is serving a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay’s conviction for conspiracy, fraud and other charges was suspended when he died of a heart attack last year.
Neither down nor out in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough fuel capacity to fly direct from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
But this is a small expense for some of the rich Russians.
“It has capacity for up to 18 passengers,” says Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
“But no one asks for that model of so many seats because it is for family private flights or for presidents of a company.”
Mr. Firer was in charge of Gulfstream’s booth last Friday at the Millionaire’s Fair, a four-day orgy of consumption held at an event center near the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, another 200 luxury suppliers had set up their exhibition stands, hoping to lure wealthy new Russians into all sorts of products, from mahogany-crafted yachts to diamond-encrusted car grills, worth 50 cents.
Mr. Firer looks cautiously at a bright orange Porsche on the stand next to his."
“It’s a beautiful car, but it’s nickel and cauldron compared to us,” he said.
“After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private jets.”
Fueled by the oil boom, the Russian capital resembles Dallas when it was at its peak.
“We lived through the same thing in 1890, when some wealthy Americans came to meet in Europe, where they were seen as materialistic,” says Marshall Goldman, a senior professor at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
“Like the Saudis in the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, Russians are emerging as the world’s largest consumers and spenders.”
The world’s most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their piece of the pie.
Elsewhere in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry will be held this week with Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the president of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell luxury goods in markets such as Russia.
(The conference is organized by the International Herald Tribune, owned by the New York Times company)
Russia has 53 billionaires making a total of $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, the second-degree rich include 103,000 Russian millionaires whose money reaches $670 billion, according to a study of the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, written by economists at the Center for Economic and Financial Research, a local think tank.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8 percent of Russians were below the subsistence level.)
“There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow – and that’s why we’re all here,” says Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative for David Morris, the London jeweler.
She attends the fair for the first time together with the Russian distributor of the brand, the Soho Jewelry group.
“Women are impeccably prepared and men are very worthy.”
Visiting the fair on Sunday night, dressed in evening dress, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, described their clients and themselves as millionaires.
“I was looking at the cars and I’m trying to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche,” said Yumatova, who re-elected off the design suit she wore as a red carpet veteran dishing with Joan Rivers.
The fair aims to attract the nouveau riche, the kind of buyers who would be willing to stay several hours in a warehouse that mixes brands from Cadillac Escalades, platinum pen cutters, M<0xC3><0xB6>venpick ice creams, tables for custom pools, Dubai apartments and Gund teddy bears.
The general public can buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
“The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and the best,” said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotically on a stand of Delft’s royal Dutch porcelains, in front of a wall-sized reconstruction of a Rembrandt painting, made of hand-painted tiles.
“Of course, Russians are more interested in bling-bling.
In fact, sellers said the wealthiest Russians with more track records (10 to 15 years, by Russian standards) have changed their tastes from flashy logos to limited-edition brands, which would not be exhibited at a trade show.
However, several thousand people – cash millionaires, emissaries of millionaires or tourists – fill the halls every day.
And some of them buy.
On the first night of the show last Thursday, Roman Ershov, general manager of King Koil beds, said he sold two $70,000 mattress systems each, made of silk, cashmere and cotton interwoven with gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that equips high-end cars with ad hoc alarm systems, said the company had sold the bright orange Porsche, for $170,000, to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that customizes luxury cars, said it had sold three chain bracelet-shaped car grills for Rolls Royce Phantom for $55,000 each.
He showed the reporter a car wheel, designed for the owner of a Russian casino, with rays embedded with Swarovski crystals, so that it resembled a roulette wheel.
The cost: $22,000 for four wheels.
"The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich leather wheels or a portrait of his wife made of zirconium cubes, is not necessarily going to drive on those wheels," says Mr. Karapetian.
“He’s going to keep the car in his garage, along with another 30 or 40 cars.”
Even if many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Mr. Karapetian clarifies that the phrase “Russian millionaire” does not mean exclusivity, given the surge in real estate prices.
“If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you’re already probably a millionaire, at least on paper if not in cash,” he said.
“There are more of them than you think.”
Those who weren’t millionaires could at least pretend to be rich for the support of the Continental Alliance, a Russian asset management firm.
The company made four red (British-style) phone booths stuffed with stacks of fake million-dollar bills.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing manager, said his team had printed 500,000 fake tickets for the Millionaire’s Fair.
Visitors stopped to shake off piles of cash, asking their friends to take pictures with their phones while resting on heaps of cash, or pocketing a couple of million.
“You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire,” Karryev says.
'Chapuza' surgery could be cause of death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the window of the "A Little Healthier" restaurant and saw an ambulance ride up White Cape Cod, two doors down West Scott Avenue.
Suddenly, a car from the police patrol appeared.
And then another.
“Then I saw the ambulance come up,” Mr. Livingston, the restaurant’s supervisor, said that Wednesday.
"That's when I knew someone had died."
Authorities learned that the dead woman was 41-year-old Olga Arroyo, assistant to the Newark police department director.
Investigators are now trying to determine if she died due to a procedure performed by an unauthorized plastic surgeon, who is not yet identified by police, but who works at the 212 West Scott Avenue home.
Authorities have not yet determined what caused Ms. Arroyo’s death, but they are waiting for the toxicology test, although the results won’t be available for a few weeks, which will help solve the mysterious death that has plagued the upper ranks of the Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo had been an aide to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was familiar to many in the department.
“She was loyal, hardworking and tenacious,” Mr. McCarthy says of Arroyo in a telephone interview Wednesday.
“She was my guardian.”
She was protecting me.”
Mr. McCarthy said Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission, and that he left behind two children, ages 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, spokeswoman for County Union Attorney Theodore J. Romankow, said detectives are trying to determine if Ms. Arroyo died as a result of an unauthorized surgical procedure.
"That's one of the possibilities," Walsh said.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
Authorities said the house arrived about 3 p.m.
On November 21 and they found Mrs. Arroyo on a couch.
She was pronounced dead at the scene.
More than a week has passed and authorities have said little about their investigation or the owner of the house, named Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh could not say whether Ms. Castro has been questioned by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to determine which part of the house was used as a medical consultation.
On Wednesday, no one answered the door at Mrs. Castro’s home, where a withered rosebush sits at the front of the house, and a barking dalmatian at the back.
A blue drum labeled “vanillin ethyl” – used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfumes – was found at the garage door, next to a door leading to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hang from hooks on one side.
Mr. McCarthy said that when she arrived in Newark after 25 years in the New York Police Department, Mrs. Arroyo was invaluable in getting to know the new island city and its harsh political culture.
“She would say, ‘You have to watch with this one or that one,’” he said.
“She was always here when I was, and also when I wasn’t.
It's embarrassing."
The Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates to raise the stock market.
Shares jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after the market expected the Federal Reserve to ease lending conditions with interest rate cuts, which were boosted by reassuring comments from the US central bank’s vice president.
Stock markets sagged in London, New York and across Europe after Ben Bernanke’s No. 2 Donald Kohn declared that policymakers must be “flexible and pragmatic” in responding to the continued strain on financial markets.
In a clear effort to reassure markets amid rising samples of credit exchanges, Mr Kohn said recent turbulence was "partly reversed by the improvement in the market at the end of September and during October".
If the upward trend persists, it would increase the possibility of further adjustments in financial conditions for real estate and business, Kohn said.
The comments were taken by investors as a sign that the reserve is ready to inject fresh capital into U.S. markets and to make further interest rate cuts to stabilize credit conditions.
The observations also helped calm Wall Street amid bad news for the U.S. economy, such as home sales hitting a record low in October.
The fallout from the financial turmoil was accentuated by a warning from Bear Stearns, an investment bank that will cut 650 jobs, equivalent to 4% of its total workforce, in an overall cost reduction to offset losses on its investments in U.S. sub-prime mortgages.
Only 20 of those positions are expected to enter London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 331 points, or 2.55%, at close to 13,289.40, while the broad-based S&P 500 index rose 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose 165.5 points, or 2.7%, at close to 6,306.2, adding more than <0xC2><0xA3>39 billion to the value of Britain’s top companies.
Germany’s Dax index rose 2.6 percent, and France’s CAC40 was above 2.3 percent.
Earlier, the resurgence of credit stress in the markets was highlighted after strong demand at a three-month auction of funds from the European Central Bank, which considered those loans to European commercial banks at 4.7%, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the performance of the Federal Reserve and the ECB and inject extra funds into the stock markets in London, strained credit and three-month "Libor" loan rates among British banks, the biggest rise since September, 6.59%, after a steady rise since November 12.
England takes suit against Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each as difficult as the other.
Who should hit No. 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, no one is less important in the face of the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the president of the team that is on loan – with that particular title at least – is here to help Peter Moores, the coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to decide; and also because the desk of Hugh Morris, director of England, is beginning to fill with offers to become a national selector, and if not, a part time.
He who fails to get the sixth batting spot will be unfortunate, but life is often unfair and so is the sport.
It is not easy to throw away what one man does at the top of his profession, while another never goes beyond the lower level, sometimes for want of luck rather than for ability.
Not only in cricket the choice is difficult, because it requires judgments that always end up being subjective.
Is it the right time for Bopara to get up?
Is it fair to Shah if he does?
The same question could be asked in another respect if, says John Edwards or “Tubby” Banerjee, two bright young executives with good degrees and who know the business well, were to be promoted to the board: there is only room for one of them.
Who should say what a good level is for a cricketer, unless they give him a chance to sink or swim to the next chance?
Figures naturally have a big influence on decisions, but so do opportunities.
Within a team, a cricketer has to catch the captain's eye at the same time taking a "wicket" and a batter to get chances to change the order if he wants to make an impact as a player someday.
But catching the eye of the selectors is more complicated.
There were many who improved last season, for example, James Anderson, who surely plays in the first test even if Stephen Harmison declares for "fit and bowls" as the wind in the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets in 33 runs for each to win a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 on the same average, but both have had their highs and can expect more from these.
The games of Shah or Bopara at the Asgiriya stadium may be only a matter of opinion.
The choice can break or make a man’s career, or it can make a small difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every test and did well in the first, with 5 wickets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, struggling to establish himself at the same time who came to become a major player, and despite scoring a double hundred against Australia in Australia, can still be underestimated.
The likelihood is that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after one more discussion in today’s session at Asgiriya Stadium, will follow their conservation instincts and favor Shah’s greater experience over young Bopara’s exuberance.
There are arguments for both.
In favor of Shah is his brilliant and valuable debut test of early '88 in Bombay, 32 first-class hundreds against only 6 of Bopara, who, at 22, is seven years younger, and has excellent track records against spin bowling.
But Shah made only ten runs in his two rounds in May against the West Indies in the test at Lords, his home as a player of Middlesex, and that caused an immediate rejection of the selectors when Vaughan claimed his place for the next match, he seemed to have taken from his "batting" some momentum that in Bombay.
On the contrary, the Essex team has joy in living on swords.
He gets caught up in nothing on the cricket pitch and his attitude was summed up as when he overturned his vehicle at an exhibition for England’s car sponsor, Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and presumably a shock, but the first thing he did was pull out his Vodafone (sponsored, of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate looking into the distance, to say excitedly, “Did you see that?”
Bopara is the best player, he is including his slippery pass to have effects on his plays that seem to satisfy him, as he bats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the best time is another.
Perhaps that is the true art of selection.
My inclination would be to give Bo for his chance, which doesn’t mean Shah doesn’t excel, as the tea leaves suggest, it’s he who plays here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work – and to the fight against Al-Qaeda
The first buses carrying Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday, expelling the exiles who ran out of cash, had no visa extensions and were waiting for the city to return to normal.
Some had even returned to fight the militants who drove them out of their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy composed of a dozen buses, the terminal was full of refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned by private transport.
“I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad,” says Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
“I came back today from what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspapers, about what happened in Baghdad and it’s safe now.”
"They say that the Mahdi army stopped killing people," he says, referring to the Shiite militia of clerical militant Moqtada al-Sadr, who ordered his troops to a momentary halt.
Qassim al-Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher in the Sunni Amariyah area, returned with her two children because it was impossible to renew her visa in Syria because the regime does not want Iraqis working in their country.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him on the phone to tell him that an allied U.S. force helped drive al-Qaeda out of its stronghold west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of Jordan’s newcomers was the head of a Sunni and Shiite tribe that had been driven from its home in Sleikh north of Baghdad by a grenade attack, after it urged citizens to rise up against al-Qaeda.
He had come to fight.
“Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had started an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and that of my colleagues.”
"That's why I came back today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many said they were drawn to the growing calm in the capital as U.S. troops entrenched groups of “concerned citizens” armed and working in cooperation with the U.S. military to defend their neighborhoods.
But many said they had returned because of visa denials and a lack of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have settled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old father of three, voiced the common suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister, asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on refugee visas to force people back.
More than two and a half million people believe they have fled the country because of sectarian death squads.
"We were fine until al-Maliki visited Syria and urged the government to stop granting visas to Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq," the Sunni said.
“I can’t believe in a government that supports the criminals who set my house on fire after I left.”
Part of the reason for the cessation of violence is that Sunnis have been driven out of Shia areas and vice versa, relaxing the tension.
There is a fear that a sudden surge of refugees will re-ignite sectarian tensions and start the fight.
Little Sarre, good education.
The smallest federal state is the first in vocational training and even shines by the international orientation of its high schools.
As in the whole country, Sarlandeses lack only an educational field.
"Yesterday I explained for the fiftieth time to a non-Sarlandian that we are not French" - that was the ironic move on themselves of the smallest federal state for its fiftieth anniversary.
At the same time France and Luxembourg have a great role in the Saar education system which in a study of the Institute of German Economy (IW) called "Bildungsmonitor" occupied the fifth place.
In this way, high schools by tradition have good relations with neighboring countries.
The University of Saarbr<0xC3><0xBC>cken was founded in 1948 by the French.
Until today, students can finish their university career here with two or three diplomas.
As a result, the percentage of foreign students is high, at 15.6 per cent.
However, the number of students from the Saarland is higher than average in high schools, many of whom do not have a baccalaureate.
"In the Saarland, the vocational education system is exploited," says Axel Pl<0xC3><0xBC>nnecke, the education sector expert at the Institute of German Economics (IW).
More than five young people complete their baccalaureate at the Vocational School, which means that the Saarland is 7 points above the national average.
On the contrary, the range of possibilities for a professional-academic education is very wide.
The offer of double races, in relation to the number of population, is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical vocational training and a growing demand, the number of engineering science graduates has dropped by a third in recent years.
That was the reason why the Saarland Ministry of Education forced higher schools to advertise more for Engineering Science majors.
“After the first PISA study, we carried out some reforms in general education schools,” says a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education.
Thus the government introduced comparative tests throughout the country.
In order for the children to start studying the last year of the project called "Kita-Jahr" as soon as possible, it has no cost. In the meantime, this model also imitates the other federal states.
The comparison with the next studies will show if the performance of the students has increased.
According to the 2003 PISA report, the number of students behind in school development decreased from 29 to 20 per cent.
But overall, the Saar did not improve as much as other federal states.
In Bavaria, students know how to calculate better.
To the chagrin of the Sarlandes, the PISA report does not compare knowledge of foreign languages, although in this field they could achieve good results.
Although the Sarlandes are not French, the language of the neighbours is a compulsory subject in secondary schools.
Chavez changes the time.
Soon in Venezuela there will be another time zone different from the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chavez allows to change the schedule in the South American country by delaying the clock by half an hour.
Currently Chavez is staying as a comedian in Spain.
As reported by the Official Gazette of the Venezuelan State, according to the new law, the hour will pass at least four hours GMT.
In this way, the South American country will have a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Among other things, Chávez, as an enemy of the United States, justifies his decision by saying that the United States once imposed an obligation on the world by changing a full hour.
In addition, on Wednesday (local time) Chávez announced the rupture of relations with his neighboring country Colombia because of the hostage-taking action.
The left-wing nationalist said he would have no relationship with either the head of state or the Colombian government until conservative <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Uribe remained Colombia’s president.
“My dignity doesn’t allow me to do that,” says Chavez, who is pushing for constitutional reform where the oil nation’s citizens must decide in a referendum on Sunday.
With this reform, his power in the country could be greatly expanded.
The reason for the conflict was Uribe’s decision to withdraw Chávez’s mandate in negotiations with the Marxist guerrillas over the release of the hostages.
Chavez said on Sunday that Uribe’s decision has offended Venezuela.
There is also a lot of talk about Chavez in Spain.
A new ringtone causes a sensation in the country: "Why don't you shut up?", is the phrase that half a million people have already downloaded.
This phrase was uttered by the King of Spain who was upset by the continuous interruptions on the part of the left populists at the last Ibero-American Summit.
In 2007 the decline of the real wage threatens the Germans.
According to one forecast, a decline in the real wage this year threatens German employees despite a strong conjuncture.
Experts present a lot of reasons for a pessimistic prognosis.
According to the calculations of the Hans B<0xC3><0xB6>ckler Foundation, German employees should have a lower real wage account in 2007 than in the previous year.
“The fault for that is the weak evolution of wages, the increase in value-added tax and the pull in food and energy prices,” Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Business Cycle Research reported in the Bild newspaper.
New unemployment insurance charges may also apply to employees.
Finance Minister Peter Setinbr<0xC3><0xBC>ck told the Neue Ostanbr<0xC3><0xBC>cker Zeitung newspaper that given the current situation, the intention to reduce the unemployment insurance burden by 3.3% from one year to the next is fair and reasonable.
Naturally, the labor office does not have to get back into an unpleasant situation, asking for credits and subsidies from the Federal State, in the words of a politician of the German Social Democratic party.
On Tuesday it was made public that the inflation rate with the explosion of prices in the food sector and the oil derivatives sector reached the highest level for 13 years.
When comparing prices with last year, they are up 3%.
Venus: Earth's twin brother.
Although its atmosphere is not suitable for life, Venus is the planet most similar to Earth, something that until now had not been raised.The European probe "Venus Express" discovered rays in the atmosphere and swirls at the poles, the same ones that also appear in winter on Earth.
For three decades now, researchers had suspected that there might be lightning on Venus.
But now the European probe has brought new evidence: it has discovered electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere. On Venus the rays are silent from a height of 54 kilometers from one cloud and behind another, says Cris Russell of the University of California in Los Angeles to the scientific journal "Nature".
According to the famous model of the origin of life of Urey-Miller, the rays caused life on Earth: storms may have caused reactions in the ocean that, in turn, would have given rise to amino acids that are the basic components of life.
On Venus it’s not like that: if there were ever life there, that would have to be in one of the earliest states of evolution,” explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution of Washington.
Today, on the surface of Venus there can be no life: the atmospheric pressure is almost 100 times higher than on Earth and on the surface temperatures of 500°C reign, oscillating in such a way that sub-zero temperatures can be reached.
"Possibly, Venus is a 'diabolical' twin of Earth, but it's still a twin," Russell said.
The main goal of the Venus Express mission is to answer the question of why Venus, so similar to Earth in mass and size, has evolved so differently.
Since since the nineties there were no special missions, only for research of this planet, the launch of "Venus-Express" in November 2005 was a very important step for the research of Venus.
The latest research results to be presented in many Nature papers, according to the researchers, underscore not only the uniqueness of Venus in the Solar System.
“This also shows that neighboring planets have more characteristics in common with Earth than we had previously assumed,” says ESA.
Despite the already known tempestuous winds at the North Pole, the researchers discovered in the south polar region also a vortex formed by the clouds that rotates faster.
This phenomenon is reminiscent of wind flows in the high atmospheric layers of the Earth's poles, as described by a team of researchers from Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Special Astrophysics and Space Physics.
The second planet of the Solar System has the mass almost equal to Earth and with its equatorial diameter of 12,000 kilometers is almost as large.
This planet also called dawn star or evening star orbits the Sun for almost 225 days.
But its rotation period is slower: one day on Venus equals 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus with its surface temperatures of 460 degrees and atmospheric pressure of 92 bar does not closely resemble Earth, scientists assume that both planets had formed under the same conditions.
On the two planets had agglomerated water that on Earth stayed in the oceans, but on Venus was dissociated in the universe.
While on Earth carbon dioxide had turned into carbon stones, on Venus it forms most of the atmosphere.
Koehler defended Merkel’s rally with the Dalai Lama.
Koehler, the Federal President, insists on the end of the fight between the parties for the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Federal Chancellery.
He indirectly criticized the German Social Democratic Party for its attacks on the Federal Chancellor after the rally in September.
Horst Koehler, the Federal President, cares about Germany’s reputation and so demanded that the grand coalition end that fight for the reception of the Dalai Lama.
“In this case we should not present ourselves as ONE divided nation,” Koehler told the Handelsblatt newspaper.
At the same time Koehler showed his understanding regarding the reception of the Dalai Lama by Angela Merkel (Party of the Christian Democratic Union) in September.
“While I have great respect for the difference between cultures, human rights are absolutely valid for me,” Koehler said.
Everyone knows that Germany has to act with great balance in terms of foreign policy, underlines the Federal President, defending Merkel for the reproach she received when carrying out a new policy with China.
"The Federal Chancellor did not distance herself from the traditional course of One China policy.
China knows that too," Koehler said.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the Minister of Foreign Affairs (Social Democratic Party), had indirectly expressed his displeasure at the reception of the Dalai Lama and was therefore attacked by the members of the Union.
Among other things, Steinmeier criticized the Union for its ineffective foreign policy.
The reception of the Dalai Lama at the Federal Chancellery caused great misunderstandings in Sino-German relations.
Thus, the Chinese government not only withdrew the invitation to Peer Steinbrueck (Social Democratic Party), the Minister of Finance of Germany, but also, according to information sources of the magazine "Spiegel", froze the so-called strategic dialogue of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of both countries.
Wen Jiabao, the Chinese head of government, demanded that Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel recognize this reception of the Dalai Lama as a mistake.
Affirming China's position, Wen Jiabao said China would not accept European politicians to receive the Tibetans' religious leader in their official position.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lama showed that he is trying to divide Tibet and the other Tibetan region of China, which now includes other provinces as well.
Schaeuble warns that there will be riots like those in France.
Battles with the police in the streets, shootings, burning of cars: Wolfgang Schaeuble warns that there will be riots as was the case in France.
The Federal Minister demands that every effort be made to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not spread to the streets.
Barricades were set up, vandals shot at the police: after serious riots by young people in France, the Federal Minister for Home Affairs, Wolfgang Schaeuble (Party of the Christian Democratic Union) fears similar trends in Germany.
“We also need to make sure that our country’s social problems don’t take on a violent form.”
"We have to take that seriously," he said in the "Neue Presse" newspaper, published in Hannover.
Not all young people are engaged in the constant change of social reality.
The federal state, federal states and municipalities are already working with emphasis to solve these problems, Schaeuble said.
This is not just about the integration of immigrants.
"From the Integration Summit to the Conference of Islam: all this is already bearing its first fruits."
It’s still early to take for granted the end of the alarm.
At the same time Schaeuble indicated that German suburbs do not have the same building and sociological problems as in France.
The youths staged serious riots in the streets with police north of Paris last night.
In Toulouse, cars and public buildings were also burned.
Kenan Kolat, the president of the Turkish Community in Germany demanded greater efforts from the Federal Government for integration.
Kolat, in view of the riots in France, warns of an imitative effect.
It is true that the situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France.
In spite of everything, actions are necessary.
Kolat indicated that the unemployment rate among young people of foreign origin under the age of 25 is above the average.
It is necessary to ensure that there are more vocational training posts.
Kolat stresses: “We have to give a perspective to young people.”
The president of the Turkish Community added that in Germany more than in France "there is a great social control in families", greater than the French country.
In addition, most young people of foreign origin do not want to destroy what their parents had built here.
Kolat says: "But in spite of everything, we have to be careful."
It is necessary to "provide the opportunity for young people to receive a job or vocational training more quickly".
Meanwhile, the night in the Parisian suburb of Villiers-le-Bel passed peacefully.
Hundreds of police participated in the action, a helicopter with headlights flew over the territory.
The authorities responsible reported three arrests, as well as garbage and burned cars.
Since the day before, a team of almost 1,000 police officers is taking care of security.
After seeing a suburb, Michelle Alliot-Marie, the Minister of Home Affairs, announced that police will take rigorous action until it is necessary.
On Monday night, around 80 police officers were injured by riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The riots continued the next night in Toulouse.
The riot began with a traffic accident on Sunday, in which two young people were killed.
According to information provided by the prosecution, the death of the young people was not the fault of the police.
In the kingdom of Angela Wolke.
The performance, far from the reality of the Federal Chancellor, shows that the coalition in terms of content has reached its last point and that nothing more should be expected of it.
But in what country does the Chancellor really live?
After her desperate performance, indifferent and without much content in the general debate of the Lower House it must be said: she does not live in the country that would have to be governed by her.
As for the reproach that was made to him for having repeatedly dedicated himself to actions in foreign policy, the Chancellor rejected it with a presumptuous phrase.
He said that would be a provincial way and thus showed that he does not want to understand what interests critics.
In the Lower House it was stated very clearly to all that this reproach was appropriate.
There was not the slightest interest or feeling for the problems of the country.
But instead, Angela Wolke presented herself in this way: a very high policy that runs away from foreign policy and stays there without achieving anything in particular.
One example: the prevention of climate change: she praised herself a lot for the decisions made in Heiligendamm, but says nothing about how these goals should be achieved here in climate issues.
In general, this way of praising herself - for two years the head of the Party of the Christian Democratic Union has not been able to afford such modesty.
For it is committed to expressions so that an impulse comes to the people.
And in this way it damages its public image by the pragmatic conception with which it solves problems without going off the beaten path.
But in Angela Wolke’s kingdom, inner problems are appearances of little value.
Child poverty and concerns about low-wage workers?
All he does is talk about it using subordinate sentences.
It’s impressive how many times you get it wrong when it comes to the children’s supplement.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three attempts to be able to formulate a more or less good phrase.
It begins to stumble "as if it had been in unknown territory," when it was a question of more concrete information.
The attack section.
The two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, clashed in a heated debate of YouTube’s Republican presidential pre-candidates and must now fear only one candidate from the outside.
From the very beginning, there has been tension between the candidates.
Mitt Romney blamed his opponent Rudy Giuliani for turning New York into “a place of refuge for illegal immigrants.”
Giuliani, for his part, responded with serious reproaches: "I would like to say that his own house was a "port" for illegals." Giuliani replies to the former governor of Massachusetts saying that he was the one who employed illegal immigrants without papers.
Candidates tend to attack: as so far the group of Republicans does not have a clear favorite, the eight presidential candidates take advantage of the debate on CNN, especially to discredit their opponents.
The small 30-second videos, shot by internet users who were sent to YouTube, also do not have much content.
“With this mode of isolation we let Hitler come to power,” was John McCain’s rebuke of his adversary Ron Paul, the only one in the meeting who insisted on immediately withdrawing troops from Iraq.
Romney also receives much criticism from Vietnam war veterans, when he refuses to recognize as torture "Waterboarding", a method of interrogation, by letting a person drown simulate his death.
The reactions of the audience in the room in St. Petersburg, Florida, show that in the meantime the most important issues of the campaign are others, not just the war in Iraq or the debates about torture.
The public always applauded loudly when they praised conservative values and denied raising taxes.
So you can better see where the weaknesses of both favorites are.
"At the time, I was wrong," Romney said, apologizing to people and television audiences for his advocacy of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the contrary, did not know what to say when asked what he thought about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
For the first time Musharraf governs without a uniform.
A day after his resignation as army chief, the Pakistani president was sworn in as president.
This is the end of eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
On Thursday, Pervez Musharraf, the president of Pakistan, was sworn in for a second five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live at the Presidential Palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to respect the constitution and act for the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday, he transferred his mandate as army chief to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thereby accepted international pressure, especially from the US.
Eight years after he seized power in a bloodless military coup, the former general rules the state for the first time as a civilian chief.
With his resignation as head of the Armed Forces, Musharraf fulfilled the main condition of the opposition and the West.
The other demand is the end of the state of emergency, which was proclaimed by Musharraf on November 3.
According to Malik Muhammad Qayyum, the state attorney general, after the oath Musharraf will very soon annul the state of emergency and fulfill the second condition of the west.
Since a state of emergency was declared in the Supreme Court, there have been many jurists who support Musharraf, and last week the country’s Supreme Court rejected all appeals before the controversial new election of the head of government on October 6.
Meanwhile, in an attack on a military convoy in the North Watyristan region, five soldiers were killed and four others were wounded.
According to the army spokesman, a bomb exploded on one of the streets on the border with Afghanistan.
The founders of Krautrock are back.
The most famous German band of the 70s continues its activity: three members of "Harmonia" participated in a concert in Berlin.
As a re-release it was made a copy of "Live 1974" which was written in the best time of the band.
In those days they were very famous in foreign countries.
The attendance of these three gentlemen at an official meal caused a sensation.
Each of them has in front of him his box, his cables and above all his buttons.
In the middle is sitting Dieter Moebius who is 63 years old and is dressed in a white shirt.
To his left is 57-year-old Michael Rother, who has his laptop and guitar.
On the right, looking out of the auditorium, is Hans-Joachim Rodelius, 73, who is very busy with the control panel.
Everyone contributes with their sounds, among them there is even rhythm.
Sometimes, without any intention, these sounds become a piece of music.
This doesn't seem to bother the gentlemen.
Something very exciting for Krautrock fans was the fact that the band Harmonia returned to make music.
The thing to rebel about here is this: Questions with precision have shown that the band’s name was ringing in people’s minds, but it wasn’t something so special that after 32 years the public missed it so much.
But why can’t the Germans also applaud their living legend of the seventies?
Especially because the Krautrock misconception was always valued more in England and the United States than in his own country.
When the entertainment industry awarded a "Echo" music award to the members of Cologne's band Can 2003 for their life's work, in the hall you could see the surprised faces of German pop artists.
And when Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the band La D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf und Neu!, everyone opened their mouths in amazement.
Later Michael Rother would spend time on stage during the Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts as if he had been an old friend (of the band).
Ignorance at home and recognition abroad are one and the same.
It is a problem to remember this band, because the trio only existed two years and in those times did not achieve a great effect on the public, however, it obtained it later thanks to the others.
Some time ago Moebius and Roedelius had made music with the artist Conrad Schnitzler and had a name, Cluster, which promised a lot of fame.
At first they played in the basement of Berliner Schaubuehne.
Then, for economic reasons, they worked with a music company in Duesseldorf that was patronized by a church.
For a time, Rother had a job at Kraftwerk and later worked as a guitarist in the band Neu! He managed to improve the fame of this German band that at that time was too radical.
In 1973 Rother followed the Cluster musicians into exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in Alten Weserdorf, which is a 16th-century ruin, they lived as refugees from the city.
The way of life was less ideological than in Common I, where Roedelius could complain about his position.
That was rather an artist’s life full of surprises.
As they say, one day an Ottenstein Harmony singing association pennant appeared in the trash, which turned out to be a good name for art.
There were also disadvantages in the use of the name Harmony.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia" and the second "De Lux".
Although the music was quiet and simple, the band had financial problems.
Life as an artist wasn’t just about getting to know yourself.
The CD "Live 1974" was recorded during a concert in Griessem. Someone remembers that in this recording almost 50 people participated.
Then Rother expressed his desire to propel Harmony and do occasional rehearsals.
For Roedelius and Moebius this demand is against custom.
In 1975, the band announced their separation.
Rother became involved in esoteric themes and secured his existence with albums such as "Flammende Herzen".
Cluster revived the 1980s and has since been more successful than Harmonia.
The live recording of the album in Griessmer, that is to thank Groenemeyer.
His music company Grienland set out to cultivate this German contribution of its own to preserve it as living music.
Like Roedelius' work, the band Neu! was also rediscovered.
The presentation of Harmonia as a band takes place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
The band was subsidised with public measures from the Wordtronics festival.
There is Julian Cope, the Englishman, the old punk and the author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also present Dr. Motte, the inventor of Loveparade.
Thus, all influences from Krautrock to the next pop music are present.
Harmonia takes the position of a super-band, a position that was empty.
Brian Eno's phrase accompanied by special music fills the room: "This music is the only true music, it belongs to the future."
There are photos where Harmony appears with producers on a farm.
The story of the legend’s development is shown in the black and white photo projections, where wired instruments are seen.
In the background are three veterans who started improvising again.
They do nothing more than attach the microphones to the organ and the drums in order to produce extraordinary tones with the help of the effects apparatuses they had built with their own hands.
Nowadays electronic music is as it should be.
Three people who delve into the technique.
But that doesn't change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, in a musical atmosphere one coughs, whispers and in a good moment of emphasis sings "Aaaaaaaah!".
Krautrock was always a term of English origin.
But it was never about rock.
The origin of the genre was not sought in the blues, but in music schools (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or fleeing artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Who here shouts "68!" is also right, but now Harmonia remains calm.
On the stage we reflect very well on what is already evident.
Where does music begin and end?
That can break one's nerves or give a few quick moments of luck.
Richard Gere just lacks more cynicism.
The two films "The Hunting Party" and "Moerderischer Frieden" are again dedicated to the war in the Balkans.
But the two didn’t have much conviction.
Either the concepts are very fixated on actions and shootings or the two films are too exciting.
Richard Gere with his "The Hunting Party" can't help in this case either.
At first there was good news: Karadzic and Mladic, the war criminals, are still hiding in the mountain of the Balkans, but precisely there, in the dark interior of the country during the Bosnian War, the actor Richard Gere was discovered again.
We had finally lost sight of the prettiest man of the eighties, because no one wanted to see him after his pleasant and unimportant roles in women’s films and after many press conferences on Buddhism.
Now, all of a sudden, Richard Gere is the most important storyline to perhaps see the movie “The Hunting Party – when a hunter becomes what he pursues” (Why do movie titles today have to be so long and silly?).
The film has a wonderful presentation for the eye: deep down, his role as a reporter in the war is the presentation of what Richard Gere could do, if fate and the film industry had not been so merciful to him. He was a man whose best times of life have passed, who as a monument to the ruin of his decadence retained until now most of his charm.
"The Hunting Party", despite this triumph, along with "Moerderischer Frieden" which is the German production and will also be presented this week, turn out to be just a series of unsuccessful films about the war in the Balkans.
The film "Moerderischer Frieden" can be narrated in a few words: it is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who want to save a Serbian from the Kosovo snipers, one of them acts very fast and that also leads him to fall in love with her.
The meaning of the film is lost by the actions and shootings, although we celebrate that the Serbs are not presented once again as the only culprits.
The film is like the German series "Alarm for Cobra 11" without a highway, but in a war situation.
In the example of "The Hunting Party" you can investigate, because in reality there was never a good film about the war in the Balkans.
At another time, with another director and another scriptwriter (Richard Shepard on two counts), the story about American reporters in the war leaving to spot a Serbian war criminal named “fox” could probably be a new “Apocalypse Now.”
Thus, the stories are surprisingly similar: the small teams go to the mountain twice to carry out something that the army can not do and each time it turns out to be a crazy trip.
One reason for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is when at the beginning we are introduced to Simon Hunt, who is not allowed to be simply a cynic with a heart.
No, the script also envisions a love affair with a Bosnian Muslim who they are going to kill later.
So "The Hunting Party" is far from reality, especially when in the last five minutes the reporters with impressive speed achieve what NATO, the CIA and all the headhunters of the world could not achieve for five years, which was to capture the war criminal and leave the Bosnian Muslims to take revenge in a fair way.
It’s so bad, it makes you want to appeal to the international court in La Hague based on crimes against cinematic logic.
However, the purpose of the film is, in reality, a deeply human one.
The film wants to condemn the fact that Karad<0xC5><0xBE>i<0xC4><0x87> and Mladi<0xC4><0x87> are still free, and highlights that the Americans and the French are not really concerned about pursuing them, because they have political arrangements between them.
Sometimes the good and the bad are so similar, that one comes to mind a very famous poem by Brecht.
In this poem it is about a mask of an Asian demon: "In the large wrinkles of his forehead I see, sharing feelings with him, how hard it is to be bad".
In movies like "The Hunting Party" there are also these demons but they show how hard it is to be good.
The problem lies not only in the genre of war movies in the Balkans.
Recently in a newspaper he published that all films about Iraq produced in Hollywood are fiascos.
It can also be added that there has never been a good film about South Africa.
There’s almost always a rule: when a star goes through a region of crisis or minefields, then something like “Rangoon” with Patricia Arguette, “On the Other Side of All Borders” with Angelina Jolie, or “Bloody Diamonds” with Leonardo DiCaprio pops up.
Possibly all of these conflicts occurred in a short space of time.
It takes at least decades for Hollywood to make a good film about the Holocaust with Schindler's List as an example.
Classics such as the Vietnam War plays "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jacket" in their time were not unanimously celebrated as the masterpieces.
Today we may know too much about world conflicts, and that is why in our times every massacre (Massenmord) is presented directly on two televisions at home.
And that’s because the scriptwriters have no qualms (which is necessary to be able to) to tell good stories.
“To be or not to be” or “The Great Dictator” turned out to be so good in the end, because Lubitsch and Chaplin still didn’t know how bad the Nazi regime really was.
Maybe you don't have to be a good person to make a movie.
Perhaps you have to be like the novelist Lawrence Norfolk, with his sarcastic and distant look of an artist.
When asked about the parallels between his historical novel "Lempri<0xC3><0xA8>re's Dictionary" and the war in the Balkans, he replied: "That's only because some things never change."
Big cities will always be in danger, men will always be cruelly murdered and war will always reign in Yugoslavia.
Von Beust received a negative criticism of the Olympic Games.
The mayor of Hamburg received much criticism from politics and economics for not soliciting the Summer Olympics.
Many want to keep fighting for competitions in the water sports section.
But Beust remembers that you have to be realistic when estimating the possibilities.
Hans-Joerg Schmidt-Trenz, director general of the Hamburg chamber of commerce, said on Wednesday that the resignation was "not good for the economic location".
In recent times no other project in the big city has fostered as much motivation as the idea of the organization of the Olympic Games.
“Without this goal, the political and sporting momentum could not be maintained at the same level.”
Schmidt-Trenz demanded the Senate not to forget this project, but to find a new long-term application “that refers to another time.”
On Wednesday, Mayor Ole von Beust maintained his statements that Hamburg’s ambitions in hosting the Summer Olympics would not be realized until at least 2028.
“Hamburg does not decide on the application for the Olympic Games, but it is decided by the German Olympic Sports Federation,” von Beust says in the WELT ONLINE.
It referred to the decision of the Sports Federation (Sportbund) expected in early December, on Munich's request for the 2028 Winter Olympics.
“This preference means for us that in this period of time, which until now we thought we would have until 2028, from the realistic point of view we will not have any opportunity.”
In spite of everything, this dream did not end forever, von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regrets von Beut's statements.
This gives the impression that in the next 25 years Hamburg does not want to apply for the Olympic Games.
"It's too early to let the opportunity be taken away, if at this moment the plans are ruined," G<0xC3><0xBC>nter Plo<0xC3><0x9F>, the head of HSB, said on Wednesday.
A waiver of the request is contradictory to the statement made by the head of the Senate at a reception on the occasion of the general meeting of the German Public High School Sports Federation (adh).
There von Beust designated the Hamburg application for Universities of 2015 not as "a replacement" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
Only last week the Sports Federation of Higher Schools named Hamburg as a candidate of the application.
The German Social Democratic Party (SPD-B<0xC3><0xBC>rgerschaftsfraktion) reproached the Senate for not taking advantage of the valuable time for the construction of houses in Hamburg.
"For many years the Senate was lagging behind the development of the small neighbourhood of Grasbrook, because it was planning for the Olympic Games or the construction of houses," said Carola Veit and Jan Quast, deputies of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD).
While the SPD always demanded an integrated planning of Olympia for the small Grasbrook and then the use of the houses built, the CDU stressed the importance of entertainment.
At that time, Hamburg’s bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics sparked great enthusiasm.
But Hamburg failed because of Leipzig.
It's not the wooden boxes.
Whoever relates the terms Sweden and wooden box, thinks of Ikea, but does not think of Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently the wooden boxes produced in Sweden are like the shadow that weighs on the list of Warhol’s works.
Most of the ninety-four Brillo-type boxes on this list are fake.
After a few months ago the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" cast doubt on the authenticity of Andy Warhol's 1968 Brillo-Boxes, the Moderna Museet Museum in Stockholm conducted internal research and came to disappointing conclusions: the six "Brillo-Boxes", which the former director of the Pontus Hultén Museum also gave to the Moderna Museet Museum, are fake, and came to disappointing conclusions.
Prehistory is too complicated with a confusing relationship between artistic and sponsored productions.
In 1964 Warhol created in New York his first "Brillo-Boxes", painted the wooden boxes red, blue and white, with the same sample that had cardboards of soap powder "Brillo".
According to Warhol, in the exhibition of his 1968 works at the Museet Moderna were exposed hundreds of Gloss-cardboard boxes. These were not made by Warhol (because of the expenses), but were brought directly from the cardboard factory of "Brillo".
These were not works of art, but examples (which were only objects) exhibited.
In the same year, 1968, Warhol allowed to produce in Sweden a Gloss-wood boxes, but they were not exhibited in the Modern Museet museum.
Witnesses of those times now speak of almost fifteen boxes, which at that time entered the history of art and auctions as originals of the "Brillo-Boxes" of "Stockholm type" authorized by Andy Warhol.
At auctions some of them were bought for more than $100,000.
The problem is that after the famous director of the museum Pontus Hultén made false statements that in 1968 in Sweden were produced and exposed almost a hundred of the wooden boxes that Warhol left to him.
But in reality, 105 boxes were produced in the same year 1990 in Malm<0xC3><0xB6> for Hultén and for the exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By this time Warhol had already been dead for 3 years.
Lars Bystr<0xC3><0xB6>m, the head of the curators of the Museet Moderna, investigated six Brillo-Boxes owned by the museum and also three of the Swedish private property that were manufactured in 1968 in Stockholm. First their tight silvers were printed and ground down and then oil-painted with the brush.
On the contrary, the structure of the copies of the year 1990 shows that the paint was applied with a roller without directly printing the tight silvers. In addition it is not oil paint, but acrylic paint.
“These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol’s Brillo-Boxes,” says Lars Nittve, the director of the Museet Moderna museum and adds that if the “Andy Warhol Art” Authentication Commission in New York does not reach some conclusion, the Museet Moderna museum will classify these six boxes as the copies/objects of exhibition.”
Already in July, the Authentication Commission formally announced that it accepts these "serious accusations" in the case of boxes of soap powder.
But from that moment on, everything remained absolutely silent.
Rebel soldiers surrender in Manila.
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers who had barricaded themselves in a hotel in Manila and demanded the downfall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo have surrendered.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who blames the president on corruption and election fraud, told a reporter he could not answer for shedding blood.
Soldiers loyal to the government had stormed the hotel using tear gas.
Nearly two hundred soldiers had barricaded themselves for a few hours in the building.
Almost half of them, including Trillanes, had a trial on Thursday for attempting a coup in 2003 that ended in failure.
He took advantage of the negotiations, to suddenly be able to deposit with about 30 sympathizers.
Evidently the military policemen who were to watch over him had passed into their ranks and continued their mutiny.
They entered the hotel "Peninsula" and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government troops blockaded the neighborhood around the Noble Hotel.
The president called for an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
Norberto Gonzales, the national security adviser, condemned the soldiers’ behavior.
"People are fed up," Trillanes said.
“We invite people to join our ranks.”
Gen. Danilo Lim, who previously led the elite Scout Reangers troop, said that before long the other military troops wanted to continue the march.
Big government critics called for a big demonstration against the president on Thursday.
For months his government has been accused of corruption.
In 2003 the financial district in Manila was a site that attracted all the attention for the mutiny that was attempted against Arroyo.
The uprising failed after about 24 hours because the army wanted to participate.
Since 1986 there have been at least seven attempted coups against the democratically elected government in the Philippines.
United Internet will be Versatel’s largest shareholder.
United Internet secured more than 20 percent of the shares of telecommunications company Versatel.
On Wednesday the company reported that the average price per share is 14.46 euros.
It has only 20.05 percent of the share capital.
There was a lot of speculation about the company’s absorption.
There are also options to further increase the financial part at Versatel.
United Internet reported that with this step it wants to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) market.
On Wednesday they already made assumptions about entering the business, after bank Brendenberg increased its stake in the Duesseldorf network operator by 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
In the financial market this means that the financial institution holds the equity securities for a third party partner.
United Internet already the previous day made the telecommunication company Drillisch participate with almost 10 percent.
Drillisch in the capital increase measure placed 17.4 million of the new shares that have a value of 106.4 million euros.
United Internet has bought 5.15 million shares of them for 31.4 million euros.
In addition, the companies began negotiations on DSL-product marketing cooperation.
"We are strengthening our collaboration," United Internet said in a statement.
The two companies founded a joint venture, MSP, to acquire competitor Freenet.
On Thursday United Internet reported that at the start, the two companies want to be happy with the ten percent stake in Freenet and do not make use of their right, that is, they do participate in 18.49 percent of Freenet.
That meant that both companies retained all options, especially the stake in the Freenet corporation.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership ended in mid-November.
This "game" with Freenet that will last for many months and is not very understandable is part of the consolidation of the German Telecom market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million customers with a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million with a DSL contract or a full contract.
So far the holding company of United Internet and Drillisch directly held 6.01 percent of the stake in Freenet.
Then they had agreed that Drillisch would get the other four percent.
The right to buy 18.49 percent of investment firm Vatas was already agreed in August.
