The triumph of right-wing populists in Austria: in total they have 29%
The perceptible weakening of both existing parties in the grand coalition and this marked strengthening of right-wing populist parties, led, according to preliminary provisional results, to early parliamentary elections on Sunday in Austria.
The Austrian People's Party (<0xC3><0x96>VP), within which the position of the current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously faltering, has suffered particularly heavy losses.
On the contrary, the electoral leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZ<0xC3><0x96>), K<0xC3><0xA4>rnten's sub-prefect J<0xC3><0xB6>rg Haider, is preparing a triumphant return to national politics.
According to the provisional results, the strongest party in the country remains the socio-democratic (SP<0xC3><0x96>) with 29.8% of the vote, compared to the last elections of 2006, but loses 5.5%.
Even worse went for <0xC3><0x96>VP, who lost with 25.6% almost 9% of the votes.
These are the worst results of these two great parties in Austrian post-war history and above all the literally catastrophic result of the popular ones, which resulted in early elections.
Even at the beginning of July, when the <0xC3><0x96>VP left the coalition, the people had a considerable advantage in their preferences over SP<0xC3><0x96>.
But the voters clearly punished them for sinking the government.
Already in the first reactions to the results there was speculation about the possible resignation of the party's president, Vice Chancellor Wilhelm Monterey.
Observers believe that it could happen as early as Monday during the extraordinary convocation of the party leadership.
This evolution should perhaps facilitate the path towards the increasingly likely way out of the electoral result, that is, towards the renewal of the SP<0xC3><0x96> and <0xC3><0x96>VP coalition.
With regard to the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the Liberals (FP<0xC3><0x96>) gained 18% in advance and the BZ<0xC3><0x96> 11% of votes - but the social democrats at the same time revealed the concern of another 1999, when the populists agreed with the popular side to the collective government, (then the FP<0xC3><0x96> was still united, in 2005 it revealed the concern of another 1999, when the populists even agreed with the popular side to the collective government, (then the BZ<0xC3><0x96> was still united, in 2005).
Haider, who has already declared that he is ready to collaborate with any party and presumes a return to Vienna in national politics, obviously plays on this evolution.
The Green Party also managed to enter the Parliament, but it fell slightly, falling among the Austrian political parties from third to fifth place.
No other party has obviously crossed the 4% threshold and has not entered Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India could cool down
If the problem could not be solved with Czech scientists who have been accused of illegal collection of beetles in India, according to Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, a certain cooling of Czech-Indian relations would take place.
The Minister mentioned this in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If it didn't work out, then it would, that would be some cooling," he noted after the meeting that took place under Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said after the negotiations that the executive branch can hardly meddle in legal matters.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr <0xC5><0xA0>vácha, who was acquitted and fined, the central government can negotiate with the local government in Dardjeeling, which falls under its jurisdiction.
"His problem could be solved," the minister said.
According to Mukherjee, it would be better for Emil Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era, sentenced to three years in prison, to appeal to a higher court.
Then he can ask for release on bail and wait for the sentence in freedom.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that, his partner expressed himself in the same way during the negotiations.
"It recommends the appeal to the High Court then it will be possible to get the pardon," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way in which the Czech side can enter into the matter, is to lend the convicts the "competent legal support", the Indian Minister argued.
At the same time, he said that such support is already being provided by the Indian side.
"We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relations that have been handed down for many years with India.
The Indians also admit it," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told <0xC4><0x8C>TK, in front of his partner he stressed that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really consider a profound error the imprisonment and prosecution of these Czech scientists," he said.
The minister avoided answering the question of whether he got the promise from the Indian side to take care of the thing.
"I've gotten relatively many promises," he just noted.
A Czech judge in the battle for the seabed
It approaches the electronic map on the wall on which Australia and the adjacent marine areas are drawn.
But he is not interested in the continent but in a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is at the same time as large as the continent itself, says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of a team of 33 OSN Division workers on ocean and maritime rights issues.
His boss, the Czech lawyer director of the Division, Václav Mikulka, is following his exposure and occasionally adds something.
The desire to work and enthusiasm dominate.
The seabed still hides a little-known world rich in natural resources.
It is possible to find oil, metallic minerals and other mineral materials, but also living organisms unknown until now that carry within themselves the key to the discovery of cancer medicine.
The largest seabed on the mainland
Coastal states have begun to take an interest in submarine territory.
According to the OSN convention, they take advantage of the laws on which they made an agreement in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf that often extends up to several hundred kilometers from the coast of the state in question.
That has according to the convention an exclusive right over all the resources of the continental shelf.
“In a nutshell, a continental shelf refers to that part of the seabed and its subsoil which is a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
The so-called exclusive economic zone extends beyond the territorial sea often beyond 200 nautical miles,” explains Mikulka.
The request for which the country submits to the commission for the definition of the size of the continental shelf must be accompanied by a very extensive technical-scientific documentation based on many investigations and expensive measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparation.
"One of our tasks is to provide the committee with legal and technical-professional help.
The committee has so far dealt with five requests, namely from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the last three nominees have been successful,” Mikulka adds.
Australia’s recent success in greatly expanding its marine holdings has had a global echo.
But New Zealand has also earned us — the seafloor area, which was assigned to it by the commission last week, of about 1.6 square kilometers, so roughly six times larger than the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
The profit, which will fruit in the future from the seabed, as they promise will be invaluable.
Other states will also gradually present their demands.
They can do so for ten years since the “Montego Bay Convention” has been ratified.
There, where the continental shelf ends, begins the area of the ocean floor that the convention declared a common heritage of humanity.
No one has an exclusive position here.
The right of extraction in this area is granted by this international institution established by the Convention.
"But the seabed is not Klondike," says director Mikulka exaggerating, "with the fact that its individual parts are legally demarcated and their regime contractually established."
The Czechs in the Pacific
Today, part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic.
If it shares it with other states of the former Soviet bloc within the framework of the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
This acquired in 1991 according to the convention, as well as investors from a few other states, the status of so-called "pioneer investor".
It has the right of extraction in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean between Mexico, Hawaii Islands and Kiribati.
The area explored by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is jagged, it is a near-submarine replica of Tatry.
"It is possible to extract on the total area of 75 000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich deposit of polymetallic agglomerates containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese,” explains another Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A worker from Macedonia’s Rober Sandev division brings with him a find to show it.
It looks like a small potato or with a little imagination, a legendary scheme, as in the legend of the awakening of the Golem.
German special units were present at the liberation of the hostages
The Egyptian government had requested help from Germany for the release of the hostages – the experts then arrived.
When the situation became critical, the special units were ready, but did not intervene.
On the circumstances of the release of the 11 European hostages seized, more and more detailed information comes to us.
The rescue operation, as mentioned by the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of the Interior, was attended by German special units.
In addition to the army specialists were present on site the GSG9 units, the Federal Avian Police, the Federal Criminal Bureau as well as the logistics experts of the technical institution.
As the ministry spokesman said on Monday evening, the German units did not intervene because the kidnappers, given the danger of a force intervention, released the hostages fleeing.
The Egyptian government accepted the help offered by the Germans, to join as assistance directly on the spot.
“We didn’t get there fortunately,” says a spokesman for the interior ministry.
The attackers kidnapped a group of travelers on September 19 in southern Egypt: 5 Germans, 5 Italians, one Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian companions.
After the kidnapping in a desert area in southern Egypt, the hostages were deported to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers until the end was kept secret as well as details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Those freed in the meantime arrived in good condition in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages are under the protection of the German embassy.
He did not elaborate on the details of the release.
In Berlin there was no information, for when they would return to Germany.
According to the newspaper "Bild" the 5 vacationers and special units are expected to leave in flight with an Airbus of the military air force and arrive Tuesday in Germany.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejects the bailout package.
The first chamber of the US Congress has just bankrupted the $700 billion bailout for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell to the bottom.
With 206 votes to 227 the American representative house rejected the government's rescue package for the financial markets.
Despite the appeals of U.S. President George W. Bush and leading politicians of both parties, there had not been a majority for the program, with which the chaos of the financial markets should have been contained.
In a dramatic move, supporters have tried desperately to persuade critics of the massive $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the leaders of the negotiations, urged MPs to agree, even though the plan was unpopular.
8. It is difficult to have gratitude to avoid something, which has not yet arrived..
While the suffrage was going on, the Dow Jones dropped more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The reason for investors’ concerns was that the state rescue package could fail.
It recovered before the end of the vote and then, after the announcement of bankruptcy, collapsed again.
Experts now expect more severe turmoil in international financial markets.
In order for the programme to enter into force, it must be approved by both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate.
Promoters register increasing numbers of bookings
It looks like it will be a good winter for German tour operators:
According to a study, the turnover on travel bookings for the coming months compared to the previous year has increased significantly - for the winter season even more than 30%.
Despite weak economic outlook the desire to travel of the Germans according to an investigation remains firm.
On bookings for the winter season travel agencies recorded a turnover increase of 31% compared to the same period of the previous year, as reported on Monday in Berlin by the German association for tourism DRV.
According to the survey of the market research institute GfK there are increased booking quotas even for the autumn months.
So the surplus of travel agencies for October compared to 2007 would have amounted to about 11%, said DRV.
The GfK figures are a prerequisite for these results, as it analyses the booking data of 1,200 German travel agencies on a monthly basis and produces statistical projections for the entire market.
Included would also be travel bookings made up to the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak price of the dollar, travel to the United States would be required in particular, DRV reported.
Here the increase in bookings would amount to about a third.
They would also be particularly popular travel destinations in Germany, Spain, Turkey, Greece, as well as inland locations in Germany.
Especially all-inclusive trips have a high price, explained DRV president Klaus Laepple.
Considering the rising costs for energy and food, the costs in this case would be "better calculable for customers than for an individually organized holiday".
Consumers could save money through, among other things, discounts for bookings made well in advance or all-inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
Even the summer months would have recorded excellent booking figures, so much so that compared to the year before there would have been a surplus of turnover again - although according to a further study the number of Germans who undertook a trip,compared to the previous year has fallen.
My first time at Oktoberfest
Ballermann hits, beer from one-liter mugs and vip in Dirndln graffiti.
A debut at Wiesn
Susanne Kronzucker and I actually have not much in common.
She is blonde, TV moderator and wears a custom-made Dirndl.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is second hand.
One thing, however, we have in common: just 3 minutes at the Wiesn, already the photographers launch themselves against us and take pictures until they fill the memory of the cameras – very flattering, and this at my first visit to the Wiesn.
That's how you make friends
The two-dollar Dirndl seems to achieve its purpose.
As a tourist of Wiesn and actually resident north of the equator of white sausages, the sense of well-being in the costume / dress to this day still remains within limits.
And once you get to the Theresienwiese, it's nothing serious.
Almost everyone wears Dirndl or leather pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed – all perfectly normal.
Only the apron of my Dirndl collects strange looks at the chocolate banana stand.
A nun points out to me that I would have fastened the apron wrongly: "On the left you are free, in the center you are a virgin, on the right you are engaged, behind a widow."
Suddenly, I put the bow from the back to the left.
All right," he says and laughs.
Others make less waste of subtle flirting techniques and wear sober felt hats, on which he heads "To drink to get dressed!" and pull the bare back against an uninvited one.
The boy with exhibitionist inclinations is called Bob, he comes from England and he also visits the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a "ooooo.".
This tells me, after he got rid of his beer mug from a liter drunk before.
Right next to one of these fire hydrants, which everyone thinks is a trash can.
Bob is one of those infamous Wildbieslers.
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At about 8 p.m. they walk in a herd on the square of the festival, the sanitary, who have to take care of the poor beoni
The nurses appear each time in a pack – always 4 at a time drag a stretcher covered from tent to tent.
This works as with most visitors to the Wiesn: you go empty, you come back full.
Who lies under the tarpaulin in this coffin from rate alcohol in the blood, is not seen.
"Des sind die, wos goarnimmer packn," one of the men yells at me and disappears into the gutter.
Victim of an accident identified by police
A 63-year-old woman who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle while walking in Essex has been identified.
Carole Paulson, of Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the incident on Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road in the city.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital, Romford, but died shortly thereafter.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on charges of inattentive driving.
He was released on bail.
Turkey is broadening its diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey tried to join the European Union, the European powers were eager to penetrate deep into the Turkish hinterland.
On the eastern side of the Bosphorus, perhaps 20 steps into Asia, lies one of the most beautiful relics of this failed imperial ambition.
The train station of Hydarpasha was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in neo-Renaissance style.
This is at least what the tour guides tell you.
The building is straddling the end of the platforms with a tower on each of its corners looking at the world like some German provincial municipalities.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building is slightly decayed.
But once inside the ticket office from the vaulted ceiling, there is no doubt about the magnitude of the enterprise of what was the most western passage.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a latecomer to the imperial game, wanted to realize its ambitions to dominate the Middle East by means of this railway that ran to Damascus, Baghdad and beyond in what is now Saudi Arabia.
But Germany’s imperial ambitions sank during World War I.
Its railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
The relative isolation from the surrounding region, generated by the icy borders of the Cold War, has passed.
British and dominating forces advanced out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And there was bad news for Hyderpasha station as well.
In 1917 an ammunition train exploded, destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then it has been slowly fading, largely overtaken by history.
But nowadays, this railway outlet for Anatolia and all points to the east, serve - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's ever-widening diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party – the AKP – has created a whole new foreign policy for the country.
Its relative isolation from its surrounding regions, generated by the icy borders of the Cold War, has passed.
Now there is a new policy of engagement.
Notably, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To estimate the parameters of this new foreign policy, I boarded the sleeping car for the Turkish capital Ankara, to visit one of the AKP’s leading foreign policy experts, Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a jolting race along the slopes that produced the ancient world cadences of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital - proposed as a new city for a secular state intent on turning its back on its Ottoman past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamic roots represents an exemplary shift in the Turkish consensus.
He suggested some suspicions in the West, most notably in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern structure of stone and steel - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by half-built shopping malls and power bakeries, where managers in business suits - both men and women - meet to make early morning contracts.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a center-right politician from almost every other political party in Europe.
Complete, tie, I'm sure he also had a Blackberry.
“The aim of the foreign policy party now is to reintegrate Turkey with its closest neighbors.
The Cold War was an anomaly," he tells me.
Turkey has been cut off from its hinterland.
Today it has to look east and west at the same time.
This was not the case for one or the other.
It must be both.
"But surely at some point," I ask, "will Turkey be forced to decide?"
"Turkey," he says, "doesn't want to face that choice."
Then he underlines a point that almost everyone I have spoken to here has recited by heart: the ties of not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus, and all around the Black Sea, are as beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, The whole of Europe can metaphorically travel those railway lines eastward through Asia and the Middle East.
Again at Hydarpasha station, after another blank night, I think of those two German gentlemen Herr Ritter and Herr Conu who had looked at this building built 100 years ago.
How surprised they would be to find that Europe’s Middle Eastern ambitions may now be, to a large extent, in Turkey’s hands.
And while I wait at the terminal for the ferry that takes me back across the Bosphorus, I remember that in those days Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe".
Then at least there seemed to be no doubt as to which continent should make claims on this fascinating country.
Remember Lives: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's music director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (Obituary, September 11) had been in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the choir.
As a member of his music scheme for the municipality, the following year he founded his wonderful youth choir, Proteus.
They were supposed to be under 21 but by the time the Proteus sang its finale in 1979, many of us were in our 20s – we simply refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological being-mutable) represented the good will of the choir and the ability to face everything the music presented to do, both madrigals and Messiaen, without accompaniment or with the whole orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often astounding, always exciting, and it was all because of that man’s inspiration and enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant through the years.
How often we were told by Tod to "let the music speak for itself."
He said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It’s all there, in the music.
So sing it!"
His technique in the use of the wand was absolutely clear and precise, though never dictatorial or flourished.
Whatever the musical standard was, it made it higher and higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If you were to name a knight a conductor would be Vernon Handley.
I knew him very well during the two decades he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
During the past 40 years and more I have covered more than 100 of his concerts and I can honestly say that I have never disagreed with just one of them - and many times inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of personal greatness and modesty.
He hated conductors who, in his words, simply “rided around the world one or two well-known warhorses.”
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary of William Woodruff (September 25) specifies that "in 1946 he resumed studying economic history at Oxford and in 1950 became a researcher at Houblon-Norman ... studying at the same time for a degree in science, one in letters and a PhD".
This follows from the author's note in Woodruff's Beyond Nab End, but is not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was Professor of Economic History at the University of Nottingham, at which time he completed a PhD thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J. D. Chambers, and subsequently published in 1958 as The British Rubber Industry.
He spent 1950-51 in the USA as a researcher at Houblon-Norman, and the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham permanently for Illinois.
Why Woodruff chose to cover this part of his career is unknown.
J. Vincent Resino at the Faculty of Philology
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino "Flamenco y vida", because his black and white photographs, in documentary style, are extraordinary.
They have drawn my attention to the simplicity and strength they convey, while treating the protagonists with particular respect.
An exhibition that conveys a lot of feeling.
Resino manages to capture magical moments."
Second round for Honda super sales
In November, Honda will begin marketing the second generation of the Jazz model.
If the previous model was already equipped with great habitability, this new minivan has an even larger interior space.
Added to all this is refined mechanics, which increases driving comfort and saves fuel.
Evolution versus revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Jazz has a line very similar to that of the previous model, the changes in this minivan are numerous.
Among others, it is worth noting an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
However, before proceeding to analyze the new model, it is useful to note that this new Jazz comes six years after the entry into the market of the first generation.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter time than those used by other manufacturers.
Although in Europe the Jazz model is less known than in other markets, it remains a unique phenomenon in terms of sales.
This is exactly the case in Japan, where Jazz was the best-selling car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
Almost one million Jazz units have been sold in Japan since its launch.
The second market was that of the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
Despite these numbers, Honda believes that the new Jazz will increase sales in the segment.
Thus, if in 2007 the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 units of this model, for 2009 the estimates are around 100,000 cars, assuming an increase in sales of 17% in the European market.
As for the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 units of Jazz since 2002, corresponding to 6.7% of Honda’s total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation, those responsible for the Spanish branch expect to sell around 2,000 units of Jazz over the course of a year.
The arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to significantly reduce the decline in sales in Spain.
In fact, the company’s managers expect to arrive at the end of the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, or 4,000 fewer than in 2007, with a decrease of 16%.
Despite the increase in sales, Honda has increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
In addition, the Japanese company expects to reach 2% in 2010.
To achieve this, Honda is confident in the arrival of another new model.
This is Insight, a five-door, compact-format hybrid - 4.37 meters in length - of which the Japanese company hopes to sell about 200,000 units per year worldwide.
For the markets, according to estimates made by the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of Insight sales will take place in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be split between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of Insight is planned for the first months of the year, immediately after the company’s presentation in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has grown in all its parts.
Its length reaches 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), the width 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the wheelbase 2.50 meters, with an increase of five centimeters.
The height, however, remained unchanged at 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in size, the habitable interior also expands.
This advantage derives on the one hand from the insertion of a new platform, and on the other hand from the introduction of the fuel tank in a central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz model.
In addition, the capacity of the trunk – equipped with a double bottom – rises to 399 liters, or 19 liters more than the capacity of the first generation.
It should be noted that these are the measurements of the 1.4 engine version, and that the boot capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
Other improvements - in addition to external elements, such as the rear LEDs or the possibility of mounting the panoramic glass - concern an improvement in terms of accessibility to the rear seats.
The doors that allow access to the rear positions, in fact, open at an angle of 80 degrees, compared to the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
In addition, the engines in this second generation of jazz are also new.
At the time of commercialization, this small model will be offered in models with 1.2 and 1.4-liter gasoline engines.
Both mechanics include i-VTEC technology that allows to lower fuel consumption, produce less carbon dioxide emissions, optimize the mechanics and at the same time keeps the engine torque high in all its phases.
The 1.2-liter model offers a power output of 90 hp at 6,000 rpm with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 rpm.
The propulsion – which in the previous Jazz reached 78 horsepower – uses 5.3 liters of fuel and produces CO2 emissions equal to about 125 grams.
Compared to the previous propulsion, which in the first generation model used 83 horsepower, 100 are now available.
The 100-horsepower Jazz 1.4 achieves a combination of 5.4 liters of fuel and 128 grams of CO2 emitted.
The "bee car" to avoid collisions
As part of the development of technologies for accident prevention, Nissan was inspired, this time, by nature, and in particular by bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, taking for example the flight of bees, knows how to avoid accidents.
It is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which is the first step towards collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at Nissan Motor Co.’s Advanced Technical Center have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Scientific and Technological Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, General Manager of Public Relations for Technology and Research and Brand Management Development, the BR23C is an expansion of Nissan’s four-area Safety Shield.
This robot is intended to improve the ability to prevent collisions in vehicles of the manufacturer.
During the flight, each bee creates its own personal oval-shaped space that is very similar to Nissan’s safety shield.
But the most important thing is the compound eyes of the bees, able to see in all directions with an angle greater than 300 degrees, and which allow the insect to fly without interruption in its personal space.
To recreate this visual functionality, the engineers developed what they called a Laser Range Finder.
This mechanism identifies obstacles that are in front of the BR23C for a radius within two meters and with a maximum amplitude of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to an on-board microprocessor that immediately prevents the collision.
“The moment it detects an obstacle, the small robot mimics the movements of a bee and immediately changes direction by turning on the wheels at right angles or greater to avoid collision.
The most obvious difference with any assisted system is that the evasion maneuver is totally instinctive.
"If this were not the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and lead engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot deviate up or down, or even diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and in the direction in which its wheels can turn and not exploiting infinite directions and ways as bees do.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot can avoid collisions.
“This device only needs to process information every few seconds, and act on that data.
It does not require the storage of information or the intuitive logic of previous maneuvers, for this it can work without interruptions and with only a couple of dozen KB of memory.
This may come as a surprise, but we’re not talking about gigabytes of memory, and we’re not talking about megabytes.”
It is the first step towards the development of new technologies for instant collision prevention, a technology Nissan hopes will be standard in cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and more durable than lithium-ion batteries.
Another potential future application of this technology could be the integration of the units with a GPS satellite navigation system to bring the driver to the destination avoiding obstacles in the path.
Trembling before applying for a loan
We must recognize that the U.S. Treasury Department, in addition to owning a lot of capital to intervene, is certainly not without ingenuity.
Faced with the crisis and to prevent Americans from committing to junk mortgages in banks with dubious insolvency, they have created a fun and educational game for users of the network: "Bad Credit Hotel".
In other words, the "Bad Credit Hotel"... or trouble.
The grim aspect of this accommodation and, in particular, of its receptionist serves to induce you to think not once, but two or even three times before asking for a loan.
And, above all, where to do it, which is probably the primary goal.
Certainly the information that the game provides is useful, but it is not detailed.
It’s more a page for teenagers than a site for the general public.
What happens if you complete the game?
Well, there's a songo room inside the hotel.
It is still something, because to buy a better house does not even speak...
Morgan Stanley opens its capital at MUFG
Morgan Stanley has entered into an agreement with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the largest bank in Japan, to invest $9 billion in a 21 percent stake in the company, following a sharp decline in its shares on the stock exchange.
A week after a tentative deal was struck, the two banks said MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley’s shares at an individual cost of $25.25, or $3 billion.
The fixed price is 19% lower than the book value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG will also invest $6 billion in the purchase of convertible securities at a conversion price of $31.25, ensuring a 10% return.
Morgan Stanley has specified that the global operation would be carried out on the basis of an average price of 29 dollars per share, that is a percentage lower than its current price of 28%.
By 5 p.m., Morgan Stanley was down 6.79% to $23.07.
“This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to a bank holding company,” said John Mack, Morgan Stanley’s chief executive officer.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which is expected to allow it to differentiate its shares but bring them under the control of the Federal Reserve.
Its alliance with MUFG also confirms how the current financial crisis is forcing the biggest names on Wall Street to adopt a much more cautious attitude than previously assumed.
The terms defined on Monday also show that in recent days the agreement has been modified: last Monday, Morgan had simply announced the sale of 20% of its shares to the Japanese giant for a sum of $ 8.5 billion.
A week ago, in Tokyo, Toshihide Mizuno, executive director of MUFG, explained: “We thought that our stake would be exclusively composed of ordinary shares.
But given the current state of the world economy and the market, we have chosen to minimize the risks and protect ourselves."
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will obtain Morgan Stanley securities at a price below their book value of 7%.
And the deal would result in an investment of at least 20% of equity on a diluted basis.”
The agreement provides that MUFG can convert half of its preferred securities into ordinary shares in a year if, during a given period, the latter are traded more than 50% below the fixed conversion price, or about $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital provided by MUFG would enable it to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
A spokesman for the group, however, declined to elaborate on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
Following MUFG’s investment, Morgan Stanley is expected to establish a Tier One solvency ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said it had "clearly" lightened its balance sheet from the end of August.
The last few weeks have put a strain on the group, which has seen the value of its shares halved while the cost of risk insurance has skyrocketed.
The cost that ebbed on Monday, however, remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" among the big Wall Street investment banks after the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the takeover of Merrill Lynch, announced that it had raised $15 billion, in part from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa in Quito on Monday.
To found the republic on a socialism proper to the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
On Sunday, following the example of colleagues and friends, it was the latter who gave voice to the draft of a new Constitution.
This was accomplished since, according to the official results, 64% of voters voted "yes" in the referendum, on a basis of votes equal to 80%.
According to these results, the "no" votes were 28%, while 7% of the votes were zero and 0.7% blank ballots.
In order for the draft constitution to be adopted, it would have to get half of the votes, plus one.
On Sunday, two exit polls and an estimate from a non-governmental organization announced a landslide "yes" victory, placing it between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed the night between Sunday and Monday the victory of his draft Constitution.
The "Constitution has triumphed gloriously," he assured, congratulating Ecuadorians within the governorate of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
As always, Chávez and Morales congratulated Rafael Correa, as did his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which took place calmly according to the election observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), was based on a text of 444 points aimed at consolidating the "new socialism" defended by the president.
This draft Constitution enshrines the power of the state over the economy, reserving it the "development planning" of a country that lives essentially from the oil extraction carried out by large foreign companies and consequently of their currency.
Conceived by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also grants more power to the head of state, who can be elected for two consecutive four-year terms, to have the opportunity to dissolve the assembly.
Correa has already announced his intention to take advantage of this amendment and to reapply for a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also affirms the gratuitousness of health and education services, which the president has begun to promote in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
It also prohibits the presence of foreign troops, a provision that will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American anti-drug operations.
19 hostages freed in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched the assault on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight escorts kidnapped ten days ago.
I'm in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions held captive in the desert for ten days were brought back safe and sound to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they had been liberated in Chad by an Egyptian commando.
Apparently in good shape, the hostages arrived at the military base in Almaza, near Cairo International Airport, around 3:30 p.m., aboard a special plane.
On board a helicopter, they were immediately transferred, without being able to give any interview to the press, to the hospital in Maadi, a residential suburb of Cairo, to be subjected to analysis.
They are in “good health” and no ransom has been paid “to the kidnappers,” Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna said on the airstrip.
Kidnapped on September 19 during a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, bordering Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been tossed from one hideout to another by 35 unknown kidnappers.
The group consisted of 11 tourists – five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian – and 8 Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of Aegyptous, the safari organizing agency.
An Egyptian security official said 30 members of the special forces, aboard two helicopters, had launched the assault during the night, just before dawn.
“There were gunshots, half of the kidnappers were killed, while the others fled,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
He explained that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the “lightning” unit were sent to Sudan, where they would be supported by German and Italian commandos.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini stressed, from Belgrade, the importance of the role of Italian secret agents and special forces.
We must admit that we achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of the men of our secret services, special forces," he said, without adding any other details.
He also denied paying a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese army said it had intercepted a 4x4 vehicle carrying the kidnappers and had killed six, including the Chadian leader of the kidnappers, and had captured two.
According to the army, the kidnappers are linked to a Darfur rebel organization, the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLA_U), a claim immediately denied by the latter.
The Silent Majority of Culture
On the front page there is a debate on the financing of culture, which is the focus of the current election campaign.
So much the better.
But a part of our cultural life is always in the shadows.
Who will speak out to denounce the paltry sums granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historic sites that are starving?
Which politician will dare to remind the federal government that it is neglecting monuments and heritage buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we do not have real laws that actually preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government pays three and a half million euros for the restoration of the Ch<0xC3><0xA2>teau de Chinon, in the Loire Valley?
With our American neighbors, it is the Constitution that affirms that the protection of heritage is part of the national culture and that the same heritage must be protected by every citizen, by every political authority and by every government department, and all this by mutual agreement.
In Quebec, at the Federation of Historical Societies of Quebec, there are at least 40 000 volunteers who, grouped in 211 societies for the protection of historical, genealogical, archives and heritage assets preserve, with money, private archives and archaeological sites.
They are the ones who often defend our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when real estate entrepreneurs and decision-makers attack our forgotten remains and cemeteries with their bulldozers.
When will the right space be reserved for history and heritage?
Benelux governments nationalize part of Fortis bank
The Benelux states are partially nationalising the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis, which was the first in Europe to be hit by the crisis in the American credit market: the three nations will provide 11.2 billion euros to the financial institution - insurance with interests also in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands agreed at the highest level over the weekend, also involving the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Competition.
In the euro area the first major crisis in the context of the difficulties in which the international financial market has been struggling for more than a year is that of the Fortis bank, and from a certain point of view the decisions taken in this regard may constitute a precedent.
According to the decision taken on Sunday night, all three states will hold almost half (49%) of the share of the bank in the country.
The bank will almost certainly sell part of its interest, including first of all the assets, especially insurance, of the Dutch ABN Amro acquired a year ago.
Last week the actions of Fortis had started with a vertical collapse, serious signs of crisis of the institute had appeared then in the second half of the week.
Analysts, however, agree that the bank, with 85,000 employees, is too big to allow it to go bankrupt.
The bank’s shares fell nearly 12% on Friday, the lowest point in 14 years.
Since January, the value of shares has fallen by more than two-thirds.
Considering the current share prices, the entire capital value of the group is around 14 billion euros, but according to the bank's executives this value is not real.
The company's top management blamed the collapse of Fortis shares on uncertainties in the non-European market due to the acceptance of the $700 billion U.S. plan.
On Monday, the title slowly picked up.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed as the bank’s new CEO.
The financial institution has also sought private buyers but so far no one has come forward with a meritorious offer.
The Belgian government had previously assured investors that they should not be afraid of losing money.
Among the bank’s customers there was no panic, the branches were not attacked.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent subsidiaries and has also acquired leasing companies.
The fox in the chicken coop
In America, life and health insurers, based on people’s medical purchase data, often refuse to take out an insurance contract.
Privacy experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
“There is a privacy program according to which the use of prescription drug data depends in any case on the approval of the person concerned.
This program must be in independent hands, otherwise it is like entrusting the chicken to the fox," writes the Washington Post quoting Richard Dick, author of the program to follow the prescriptions of the medicines.
Insurance companies make the insurance rate and the amount due in the event of a claim dependent on the health of the customer and do not take out insurance if they consider the risk to be too high.
Some time ago the client had to undergo a medical examination and the contract was only stipulated after the outcome of the examination.
Dick 10 years ago invented a much cheaper procedure: according to the customer identification code you can easily have information from pharmacies about which medicines he bought in the last year and a half and from this the program shows which diseases he suffers and what health conditions he is in.
For example, if you regularly buy large amounts of cholesterol reducers, this means that the level of fat in the blood is practically incurably high and is classified in the highest risk category.
On the market there are various versions of the program, some also determine the risk multiplier, to the insurer so in addition to paper work there is not much left, even if there are small difficulties.
Among the cons is that some medicines are usable for multiple purposes, e.g. some compounds are employable against migraine or hot flashes, but are also effective against depression.
The latter, from the point of view of insurance - commercial, applies as a factor of increased risk, the first two do not.
For the request and processing of data, separate companies have been formed and these, before obtaining the necessary information from pharmacies, ask for the approval of the patient.
The authorities are now forcing them to do so even though they have so far not imposed fines for negligence.
Some companies have also been processing the results of laboratory tests and linking them to drug consumption data in order to provide a more accurate picture of patients' health status.
More and more companies have access to data and at the same time controlling the use will be increasingly difficult.
There is a separate law on privacy but its validity extends only to health services and insurance.
In front of the Congress there is a bill that gives the supervisory authorities competence to companies specialized in data service.
Richard Dick admits that it is not enough: for this reason he has developed a program that connects the forwarding of data with the approval expressed by the person concerned.
Another issue is that the person concerned cannot so much refuse approval because otherwise the insurers do not enter into the contract.
So then in the end the chickens are entrusted to the clemency of the fox.
Global Marseillaise Menu
EU and India to double trade
Given that the European Union and India are partners that mostly trade with each other, the agenda of the ninth summit meeting was also dominated by this issue, as well as all other global issues.
Today there will be a Franco-Indian summit which will deal primarily with cooperation on atomic energy.
The European Union recognises the fact that India is becoming a great democratic power that should be given a greater voice in international affairs, but member countries have not yet been able to decide whether or not to support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
So we did not insist on this issue at the ninth summit held yesterday in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, in his capacity as President of the Union, José Manuel Barroso, President of the Commission, and Javier Solana, High Representative for Foreign Affairs, received Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed to double trade in five years, i.e. to increase it to EUR 100 billion.
Considering that between 2000 and 2007 trade in goods rose from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an overly ambitious goal.
As a result, they have legally unified the 26 bilateral civil flight agreements, so air traffic can also take off in the future.
India wants to sign a free trade agreement with the EU by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy has promised to speed up the deal.
The goal is to balance because while the EU is India’s top trading partner, New Delhi is only ninth among the EU’s partners.
The summit devoted attention to global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and terrorism, the latter condemned in all its forms by both sides, and urged the convening of a UN conference.
They urged the conclusion of the Doha Trade Round, although both sides had a role in the failure of this.
The EU has confirmed that it persists in the energy and climate programme, i.e. it would like to reduce emissions of harmful substances by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agrees on this, as well as on the need to conclude a global pact at the climate conference scheduled for next year and reduce greenhouse gas production by 50% by 2050.
They also want to curb the rise in food prices and have supported the convening of an international meeting to examine the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister will travel to the French capital today, where a bilateral meeting is preparing to sign a treaty on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris, it is hoped that French companies will receive a contract worth 20 billion euros to build India’s nuclear reactors.
According to information from our news agency, the deal would last 15 years.
In Frankfurt over three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
Over three hundred Italian publishers will be present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international event for the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair is expecting more than 7,000 exhibitors from 101 different countries who will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the Fair with over 403,000 titles on display and with Turkey as the guest of honor.
The Undersecretary at the Ministry for Cultural Heritage and Activities Francesco Maria Giro will represent the Italian Government at the inauguration ceremony of the Italian Pavilion: Italy will in fact be present institutionally with a Punto Italia - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
The meeting with the press will be held at the Room Struktur in Hall 5.0 of the Buchmesse: this will be an opportunity to present figures, trends and perspectives on the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of foreign author books on the total Italian production, and in particular on that for adults and children, decreases progressively.
Steve Fossett's plane found, the billionaire who disappeared a year ago
The wreckage of the plane of Steve Fossett, the billionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying in the Nevada desert, was found.
The wreckage was found on a plateau at an altitude of 3,000 meters, in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammoth Lakes, on the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the aircraft, however, there were no human remains.
“The plane was located, we sent a team, and now we have confirmation that this is exactly what Steve Fossett was flying on the day he disappeared,” he said at a news conference.
The sheriff said no human remains were found on the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old billionaire was presumed dead in February.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said that a few hours after the wreckage was sighted, a team of investigators was sent, which then identified the device: this is the Bellanca 8kcab, missing since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, also in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fossett’s personal belongings were found by a couple near their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents by the name of Fossett, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a sweatshirt.
Fossett's search was halted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had earned a place in history thanks to a long series of records.
In 2002, on his sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete a round-the-world flight on a hot air balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later, he travelled around the world by plane and non-stop.
Among his many records, he also flew at 15,445 meters above the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
An out-of-the-box SUV with an original design and well defined by sharp lines, wide surfaces and sharp corners.
This is, in summary, Glk the latest born among the "compact" offroads of the house of the star with which Mercedes-Benz has tried to give a breath of newness in this sector.
Precisely for its contents outside the traditional canons, the communication that will accompany the launch of the Suv Glk, available at Mercedes-Benz showrooms from next October 17, will also be unexpected and unconventional.
Thus the advertising hype that will accompany the debut of the new car will start an unprecedented mode of communication also through a futuristic campaign of 3D posters, used for the first time in Italy by an automotive brand.
A project of maxi-posting, divided into three different phases, which will dominate the central shopping street of Milan, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision and thanks to special glasses distributed near Corso Como it will be possible to see the new SUV in almost real size and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, looking at the image you will have the impression that the car comes out of the poster.
Subsequently, through the use of the innovative Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its details, and then recomposed into a single image.
Undoubtedly Mercedes with this advertisement is trying to introduce something new in the stereotypical field of automotive communication.
Will this formula be able to pique the interest of future buyers? We will see.
Here are the Italian hooligans.
Of the Triveneto, they risk the Daspo.
But who are those 150-200 boys and girls of whom all Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the "Ultras Italia" group that has been following the Italian National Team for years and that until now, in truth, had never created excessive problems.
Nor had he ever clashed with the opposing fans.
The extraction of the group is right.
The promoters come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
To these in Sofia have been added small groups (few units, in fact) from Campania and Puglia.
They have tricolor flags where the cities of origin of the militants appear: Saturday evening they were removed to not be identified.
They are inspired by the English fans.
In Bulgaria they found a supporter of real Nazis, that of Levski.
The FIGC had made 144 tickets available to Italian fans for the match: all names, therefore easily controllable.
And the Viminale in fact had checked them all: among those who left for Sofia there was no one with a Daspo in progress, no one who had been inhibited from attending a stadium.
Four blue fans, who had a history of stadium crimes, had in fact been refused the ticket and prevented the trip.
Now the Viminal is waiting to read the acts that will arrive from the Bulgarian police then it will take measures: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo for at least five years to the fans who have been arrested or to those who have been identified in the riots.
An international Daspo that prevents you from attending not only the Italian stadiums but all over Europe.
Our hooligans, in short, will no longer set foot in a stadium.
Thankfully.
But now there is the fear-emulation: that to those little more than a hundred and fifty, others are added.
“We must put out this fire immediately and not legitimize those who behave in this way,” they argue from the Viminale.
So, "eyes wide open especially in view of Wednesday's National Team match in Lecce".
In fact, in Puglia there is a small nucleus of supporters of Ultras Italia.
Tomorrow the Observatory meets, Tuesday the Casms that can also count on a section of the Aise, that is, the secret services, which deals with stadium problems.
"The Duce-Duce choirs and the outstretched arm during Mameli's anthem? In Bulgaria it is not a crime...".
This is the thought (expressed in a very unhappy way) of Domenico Mazzilli, director of the Viminale Observatory for a few weeks (he took the place that was first of Francesco Tagliente and then of Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had previously been quaestor of Trieste where there is a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to praise the Duce but certainly the behavior of those 150-200 fans was shameful.
"I do not do the sociologist - adds the No. 1 of the Observatory - the crimes must be attributed in the country where the fact occurs.
Until now this group had remained in line, now we will see what happened and we will evaluate for the future.
But let's also talk about the whistles to the anthem of Mameli: even those are not a crime, but if you allow me, they are not education ... ".
