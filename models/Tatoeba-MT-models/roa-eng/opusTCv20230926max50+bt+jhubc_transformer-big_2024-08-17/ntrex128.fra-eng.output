Members of the Assembly of Wales worried about "passing for puppets"
Welsh MPs are dismayed by a proposal to replace their title with the acronym MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal stems from the proposal to change the name of the assembly, which would become the Welsh Parliament.
In the political sphere, some members of the Assembly believe that this could be ridiculed.
A Labour MP said his group was concerned that the acronym “rhymes with Twp and Pwp”.
For non-Welsh readers: in Welsh, twp means stupid, and pwp means crap.
According to one of its members, the Plaid Cymru (Party of Wales) is not "satisfied" and has proposed other formulas.
The Conservative party would be "open" to a name change, but noted that between MWP and Muppet, the distance is narrow.
In this context, in Welsh, the letter w is pronounced as the letter u in English from the Yorkshire region.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently preparing the legislation introducing the name change, indicated that “the final decision regarding the appointment of the members of the Assembly is up to the latter”.
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gives the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposal to designate the Assembly as the Welsh Parliament, which was widely supported.
On the issue of membership, the Commission favours Members of the Welsh Parliament (or WMP); however, a large majority of Welsh people prefer MWP.
It seems that the members of the Assembly are making other suggestions, but the effort to reach a consensus could prove to be a real headache for Elin Jones, the Speaker of the Assembly, who is expected to submit a bill on the name change in the coming weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes to the functioning of the assembly, including rules on the exclusion of members and the design of the committee system.
The members of the Assembly will take the final decision on the name issue during the debates on the bill.
Macedonia: Referendum on changing the name of the country
The Macedonians will decide on Sunday whether their country should henceforth be called the “Republic of North Macedonia”.
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to resolve a decades-old dispute between the country and its Greek neighbor, for whom Macedonia is the name of one of its provinces.
For a long time, Athens has insisted that Macedonia's name is a claim on its territory and has repeatedly vetoed its neighbour's accession to the European Union and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposed the referendum, said he would not take the results into account.
However, supporters such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev maintain that the name change is only a small price to pay to join the EU and NATO.
Harlem: Churches in Trouble, St. Martin’s Bells Silenced
“The older people I talked to say that traditionally, there was a bar and a church on every street corner,” Adams says.
“There are no more today at all.”
According to him, it is normal that the bars have become rarer.
Today, “we don’t frequent each other in the same way anymore,” he explains.
“We used to go to the bar like our neighbor, but that’s not the case anymore.”
As for the churches, the funds from the sale of buildings will run out long before what officials imagine, and this worries him: "sooner or later, they will return to square one."
He adds that the churches could be replaced by condominium complexes, inhabited by individuals who will not help maintain the last sanctuaries of the neighborhood.
“The people who will buy condominiums in these buildings will be largely white people who will rush to close all the churches because they are unlikely to become members,” he said.
Before Harlem became a black metropolis, white congregations built the two churches: Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin 10 years later.
The initial white Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
A black congregation, which was preaching nearby, took possession of the building.
The Church of St. Martin was taken over by a black community under the direction of the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who initiated a boycott of the shops on 125th Street, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem, in which blacks struggled to be employed or to get a promotion.
In 1939, a fire ravaged the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners were preparing to rebuild and ordered a new carillon.
Father Johnson’s son and successor to the leadership of St. Martin’s Church, Reverend David Johnson, proudly called the “bells of the poor people.”
Tiffany Ng (University of Michigan), the professional who played it in July, gave it a completely different name: “a cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument”.
She also mentions that it is the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who, 18 years ago, took his place in front of the largest carillon in Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather claims that Saint Martin did not replace him.
In recent months there has been much talk of the mutiny of architects and entrepreneurs, provoked by the secular elite of the church on the one hand, and the episcopal diocese on the other.
In July, the parish council, a governing body composed of lay leaders, informed the diocese that it was concerned that the latter would impose the costs incurred, even though it did not participate in the recruitment of professionals.
Some parishioners lamented the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
California: 13-year-old boy injured by shark during lobster fishing game
Authorities say a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old last Saturday while fishing for lobster in California on the opening day of the season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV, the San Diego TV station, that he had been diving with friends for half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and began paddling up to him to pull him out of the water.
At first, Chad thought that the young boy was shouting for joy at having had a seizure, then he realized that in reality he was not.
had been bitten.
Arriving near the young man, Hammel noticed that he had an open fracture of the collarbone.
“I was screaming for everyone to get out of the water: There’s a shark!” Chad explains.
The boy was evacuated to Rady Children’s Hospital in San Diego, where he is still in critical condition.
The shark species responsible for the attack is not known.
Rescue chief Larry Giles told a news conference that a shark had been spotted a few weeks earlier, but that it was not a dangerous species.
He added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
The authorities closed access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami’s beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours, to investigate as well as for security reasons.
Giles said there are more than 135 species of sharks, but most are considered non-hazardous.
Sainsbury's offensive plans in the British aesthetic market
Sainsbury's makes Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams low and stocked them with supermarket-like shelves, filled with aesthetic and cosmetic products and managed by specialists in the field.
As part of a major breakthrough in the <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion UK beauty market, which continues to grow while sales of fashion and home goods are plummeting, more extensive beauty product aisles will be trialled in 11 stores and applied to others if the experience proves conclusive.
Supermarkets are now investing in the beauty market with the aim of reusing the space previously occupied by televisions, microwaves and other household items.
Sainsbury's said it would increase the volume of its offerings to 3,000 cosmetic items, which will include for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees ranges will also have more space in sectors similar to those of boutiques such as Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique makeup line to offer a majority of products not tested on animals, an increasingly important criterion among young consumers.
In addition, fragrance seller Fragrance Shop will test concessions at two Sainsbury's stores, the first opened last week in Croydon, south London, and a second scheduled to open later this year in Selly Oak (Birmingham).
Supermarket managers need to dig deep to attract consumers, who are increasingly tending to shop online and head to convenience stores for everyday food items.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said outlets will look more and more like supermarkets as the supermarket chain tries to counter discount stores Aldi and Lidl by offering more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has set up Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also opened the doors of several Habitat stores, since the purchase of the two chains 2 years ago, which, according to the group, has made it possible to boost sales of everyday consumer goods and make acquisitions profitable.
Previous attempts to restructure the British chain's pharmaceutical and cosmetic product lines had failed.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury's attempted a partnership with Boots, but it ended following a controversy over the distribution of profits from pharmacies located in supermarkets.
It was after selling its 281 pharmacies for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds pharmaceutical chain, three years ago that the new strategy was implemented.
Lloyds was to play a role in this by introducing a wide range of high-end skincare brands to four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Chief Commercial Officer of Sainsbury's, announced that the appearance of the beauty department has been modified to improve the customer environment.
“We have also invested in training so that our staff can offer sound advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet any type of need and, thanks to the beautification of our stores and the ideal location of our establishments, our dominance of the cosmetics market is now undeniable and changes shopping habits, "added Mr. Mills-Hicks.
Peter Jones angered after Holly Willoughby pulled out of <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
Annoying Dragon's Den TV star Peter Jones after host Holly Willoughby announced she was pulling out of a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with her home decor brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby does not have time to take care of the interior decoration and accessories brand Truly.
The activity of the two protagonists has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning host announced on Instagram that she was retiring.
Holly Willoughby has angered Peter Jones, the star of Dragon's Den, by pulling out of their successful textile and interior design business at the last minute, to focus on his new exclusive contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was furious when the TV darling revealed at a tense meeting at the Dragon’s Den star’s commercial empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that his new <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million contracts no longer allowed him to deal with Truly, their home décor and accessories brand.
The Truly brand has been equated with actress Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop and could have doubled the value of the host’s estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones jumped into her private jet to join one of her second homes outside of Britain.
According to one source, “Truly was by far one of Holly’s top priorities.
and is on track to secure its future for the next 2 decades.
His decision left everyone speechless.
No one could imagine what was going to happen on Tuesday, the launch was so close.
Marlow’s headquarters are filled with products ready to be sold.”
Specialists believe that the departure of the This Morning host, one of Britain’s most bankable celebrities, could cost the company millions, due to significant investments in products ranging from cushions or candles, to clothing or interior items, and the risk of a delayed launch.
This could end a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, parents of three children, had been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Holly Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016; Jones, 52, joined the group as president in March of the same year.
The couples went on vacation together, and Peter Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is expected to become the brand ambassador for M&S and take the place of Ant McPartlin as host of ITV’s I’m A Celebrity program.
A source close to Jones said last night he did not want to comment on his business activities.
The debate was heated, but in the end we love each other
Trump has poked fun at the media who criticize him because of his comment that some deem “unworthy of a president,” and for being so positive toward the North Korean leader.
“Why did President Trump give up so much?”
He grinned, taking on a TV journalist’s voice.
“I gave up nothing at all.”
He said Kim Jong-un had been supportive of holding a second meeting, after Trump called the first, which took place in Singapore in June, a big step toward denuclearizing North Korea.
However, negotiations on denuclearisation have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that he saw no “corresponding response” from the United States to North Korea’s first disarmament measures.
He deplored the fact that, on the contrary, the United States continued to impose sanctions aimed at maintaining the pressure.
In his rally speech Trump offers a much more optimistic perspective.
“Everything is going well with North Korea,” he said.
We have come close to armed conflict.
“Millions of people would have been killed.
We now have a great relationship.”
According to Trump, his efforts to improve relations with Kim have resulted in positive results: the end of missile tests, the release of hostages and the remains of North American soldiers returned to their families.
He also justified his unusual approach to relations with Kim.
“It’s so easy to play the role of president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to access this packed arena, there are barely more than 200 standing in front of me,” he said, pointing to the crowd.
Tsunami: a devastated island and hundreds of deaths in Indonesia
After the earthquake that shook Lombok, help from foreign NGOs was supposedly not needed.
More than 10 per cent of Lombok's population was scattered, but no state of national disaster was declared, a requirement for international aid.
“Unfortunately, they have often made it clear that they do not want international aid, which complicates things a bit,” Ms. Sumbung said.
While the Save the Children organization is setting up a team to go to Palu, it still does not know if the work on the ground will be allowed.
Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster management agency, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to humanitarian aid.
Despite constant shocks, the country is sorely lacking the means to protect itself from the whims of nature.
Shelters have been set up in Aceh, but they are rare in other coastal areas.
Although a warning was issued, no alarm siren sounded in Palu, which may have contributed to the loss of life.
Even under ideal conditions, moving from one Indonesian island to another is not easy.
Natural disasters further complicate the use of transport.
A hospital ship that had been sent to Lombok to treat the victims is now en route to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the scene of the new disaster.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has placed the crumbling infrastructure reform at the centre of his election campaign and has spent considerable sums on rebuilding roads and railways.
The lack of funds, however, has undermined the government of Mr. Joko, called to stand before voters next year.
Indonesia’s head of state is also under pressure from continuing inter-ethnic tensions in the country, where members of the Islamic majority practice their faith more conservatively.
More than a thousand Indonesians have lost their lives and tens of thousands have been driven from their homes amid street clashes between Christians and Muslims, armed with machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
Watch: Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge equalizes against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge spares Liverpool a Premier League loss to Chelsea, scoring in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge (London).
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was about 30 yards from Chelsea's goals, and his team was led 1–0.
He shot into the ball on his left, before escaping a shot to the second post.
The ball flew over the repair surface before heading to the upper right corner of the net.
The ball eventually reached Kepa Arrizabalaga and finished its course at the bottom of the cage.
“I was just trying to get in, to get the ball, but players like Shaq are always shooting as far as possible, so I tried to gain as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw that Kante was approaching to control and without really thinking much I decided to shoot.”
Chelsea led 1-0 at half-time after a goal by Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues forward hit a pass in the direction of Mateo Kovacic, before heading for midfield and sprinting towards Liverpool.
Kovacic made a quick back-and-forth in midfield,
He then made a magnificent deep shot that brought Hazard to the surface.
Hazard overcame the defence and finished his run in the net from the second post, with a left foot shot behind Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the San Paolo stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
Indonesia: Tsunami death toll rises to 832
The disaster management agency said Sunday morning that the toll from the earthquake and tsunami is 832 dead.
Many residents are trapped under the rubble of buildings destroyed by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake that shook the country on Friday and triggered waves 6 meters high, Sutopo spokesman Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
With more than 380,000 inhabitants, the city of Palu was strewn with debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of stabbing woman
A murder investigation has been opened after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead (Merseyside) this morning.
At 7:55 a.m., the stabbing 44-year-old woman was discovered on John de Grayson Mews Street, and a 32-year-old man suspected of murder was arrested.
Police are urging residents of the neighborhood who may have seen or heard something to give their testimony.
Police Captain Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation has only just begun, but I would like to ask anyone in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
In particular, I appeal to taxi drivers, who could have picked up something on their dashcam and ask them to provide us with any crucial information for our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the murdered woman was found at a Birkenhead property where she resided.
This morning, people claiming to know the woman showed up at the crime scene and asked questions about where she was discovered.
The investigation is ongoing and the police have indicated that they are informing the victim's close relatives.
A taxi driver has just been denied access to his apartment in Grayson Mews, with police not allowing anyone in or out of the building.
The news left him speechless.
Residents have just been informed that the building would be inaccessible for several hours.
A police officer said the entire area was considered a crime scene.
A woman in tears appeared at the scene.
He said, “It’s too horrible.”
At 2 p.m., two police vans were posted inside the cordon, and one outside.
Several officers were guarding the building on the inside of the cordon.
Anyone with information is asked to send a message to <0x40>MerPolCC, to call 101 or to contact Crime Stoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
Parliament: Cromwell's statue, last victim of an attempt to rewrite history
Its prohibition would be the just return of things, in view of the acts of destruction, of innumerable religious and cultural goods of England, committed by its Puritan partisans, such as the fanatical Taliban.
However, the Cromwell Society found Mr. Crick's proposal "unreasonable" and described it as a "revisionist attempt".
The president of the Cromwell Society, John Goldsmith, says that, "given the current debate around the removal of statues, it was clear that Oliver Cromwell's statue erected in front of the Palace of Westminster was not going to be spared.
Cromwell did not order or conduct iconoclasm during the English Civil Wars.
It is likely that his person was sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The superb depiction of Cromwell, sculpted by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, attests to the 19th-century esteem for him and belongs to the historiography of a personality that many of us still celebrate.
Mr Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as an advocate of parliament against external pressures, I mean monarchy of course.
Whether this representation is accurate or not is an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict that broke out in the mid-17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a particularly recognizable figure who represents one side of the divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be highlighted and commemorated.”
China: A pig kills a farmer
According to local media, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southeastern China.
Identified as M, Yuan, the man was found dead, artery cut and covered in blood near a pig market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines to pigs in a pig barn on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He is said to have travelled with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday, with the aim of selling 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that a door to the nearby pigsty was open.
He claims that a huge male pig was inside and that blood flowed from his mouth.
A forensic report confirms that the animal weighing 250 kg mutilated the farmer to death.
According to Guiyang Evening News, Mr. Wu, the farmer’s cousin, said that “his legs were crushed and covered with blood.”
Security cameras show Mr. Yuan arriving at the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his animals.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The pig that caused Mr. Yuan's death did not belong to the farmer or his cousin.
A market official told the Evening News that the animal was locked up to prevent any further incidents and allow police to gather evidence.
The family of the farmer Mr. Yuan and the market leaders are reportedly negotiating compensation.
Although the facts are rare, hog attacks on people have already been reported.
In 2016, on a farm in Massachusetts, a pig assaulted a woman and her husband, seriously injuring the latter.
Ten years earlier, a 295kg pig trapped a Welsh farmer on his tractor before his wife managed to get him away.
In 2012, when an Oregon farmer had just been eaten by his pigs, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that he was not an aggressive animal in principle, but that the taste of blood can cause this type of behavior.
“They are very playful animals.
Very curious kids... they have no intention of doing any harm.
Just show them the respect that is due to them,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa are expected to cause heavy rainfall in the southeastern United States
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the colder waters of Mexico's northeastern coast.
However, Rosa will cause showers in northeastern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
The winds had been blowing at 135 km/h (Category 1 hurricane) since 5 a.m. Eastern Time on Sunday, while Rosa was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The hurricane is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression is beginning to form over the Pacific Ocean and is circulating eastward toward the west coast of the United States. As it approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday in the form of a storm, Hurricane Rosa will bring intense tropical moisture northward into the southwestern United States.
It will fall up to 25 cm of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical humidity combined with the approaching depression will create widespread torrential rains in the Southwest over the coming days.
At the local level, precipitation of between 2.5 and 10 cm will cause dangerous flash floods, debris flows and potential landslides in the desert.
Rainfall will reach a rate of 5 to 7.5 cm per hour in places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona, due to the intensity of tropical humidity.
It is expected to fall between 5 and 10 cm of rain in southwestern areas, including much of Arizona.
Disseminated tropical rains are likely to cause flash flooding and rapid deterioration of conditions.
It is strongly discouraged to venture into the desert on foot due to the threat of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rains could turn the canyons into raging rivers and thunderstorms will produce gusts of wind and swirls of dust in places.
The approaching depression will give rise to abundant local rains in some southern regions of the country, on the Californian coast.
Rainfall totals can reach more than 1.3 cm, which could cause low flows of debris and make the shoe slippery.
It could be the first rains of the dry season in the region.
Scattered tropical showers will reach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday morning, then intensify later Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will fall across the country on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
Significant temperature variations are expected for October across the United States due to the cooling of the Arctic, but the climate of the tropics will remain warm,
which sometimes causes a radical change of time over short distances.
The central region of the United States, which will experience considerable temperature differences on Sunday, is a perfect example of this.
Between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, or between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, the difference is almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, persistent summer heat will try to infiltrate and intensify again.
Much of the central and eastern United States is expected to experience a warm early October, with temperatures hovering around 26 degrees covering the southern plains and other northeastern regions.
Mercury could reach 26 degrees in New York on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above the seasonal average.
The multi-day forecast indicates that temperatures are expected to be above average in the eastern United States during the first fortnight of October.
Brett Kavanaugh trial draws more than 20 million viewers
Broadcast on six television channels on Thursday, the striking hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accuses him of sexually assaulting her in the 1980s, were attended by more than 20 million people.
While the political stalemate continues, broadcasters have interrupted their usual Friday program to announce a twist: an agreement devised by Jeff Flake, the Arizona Senator, to allow the FBI to conduct an investigation into the charges for a week.
Before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Christine Ford said she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh, under the influence of alcohol, had engaged in touching his person and had tried to remove his clothes during a party between high school students.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate tirade, claimed to be also 100% certain that this had never happened.
According to a Nielsen report, the trial likely reached an audience of more than 20.4 million people.
The company calculated the number of viewers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Figures from other channels broadcasting the trial, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen is not always able to estimate the number of people who watch TV at the office.
For comparison, the trial attracted as many people as a football game or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose hosts have largely supported Kavanaugh’s nomination, was the most-watched channel on the day of the auditions, with an average of 5.69 million viewers.
ABC was in second place with an audience of 3.26 million.
CBS (3.1 million), NBC (2.94 million), MSNBC (2.89 million) and CNN (2.52 million) followed, according to Nielsen.
Interest did not wane once the hearing was over.
Flake was at the center of the drama that was playing out on Friday.
After the Moderate Republican’s office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras unveiled a scene in which the senator is taken aside by protesters as he attempts to take the elevator to the Judiciary Committee hearing.
Flake looked down for several minutes, while CNN broadcast the sequence of the interpellation live.
“Don’t look away, look at me,” one of the women says.
“Do you really think he’s telling the truth?
You hold power when so many women are destitute.”
Before the elevator doors closed, Flake said his office issued a statement and would say more at the committee meeting.
All of the cable and broadcast networks were covering the session live a few hours later, as the Judiciary Committee prepared to vote on the procedure for advancing Kavanaugh's Senate-wide nomination.
Flake indicated, however, that a week-long investigation should first be conducted by the FBI into the allegations made against the candidate, which minority Democrats were calling for.
Flake was partly swayed by a conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
He made his decision after speaking with Coons and several other senators afterwards.
His choice weighed heavily in the balance, as the Republicans would not have actually obtained the votes to approve Kavanaugh's nomination without a prior investigation.
President Trump authorized the FBI to investigate Brett Kavanaugh’s sexual assault allegations.
Britain: May accuses Brexit opponents of ‘small policy’
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of doing "small politics" at the expense of Britain's future and the national interest.
May arrived at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another exchange with the paper, which published a photo of Theresa May on the cover, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued his attacks on her so-called Chequers plans, saying the free trade proposal between Britain and the European Union was “properly ridiculous.”
Wayde Sims: police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspected of causing the death of the LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting that killed Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, also 20, has been jailed and is charged with second-degree murder, Baton Rouge police said.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the altercation.
Found at the scene of the crime, the glasses bore Simpson's DNA, according to WAFB, a subsidiary of the CBS group.
During his interrogation, Simpson confessed to the police that he was responsible for Wayde's death.
According to his lawyer, his bail was set at $350,000.
The Baton Rouge parish coroner's office on Friday released a preliminary report, which determined that the death was caused by an injury from a bullet that went through the head and lodged in the neck.
The police service acknowledges assistance received by the Louisiana State Fugitive Task Force, the state police forensic laboratory, Southern University Police, as well as citizens, in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU sporting director Joe Alleva thanked law enforcement for their “commitment and pursuit of justice.”
Sims was only 20 years old.
At 1.98 m for 98 kg, the player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at the LSU.
On average, he scored 5.6 points and made 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, Will Wade, the LSU basketball coach, said the team was "devastated and in shock" after news of Wayde's death.
“We dread this kind of event all the time,” Wade said.
Mexico: a volcano spews ash
From the ash escaping from the volcano Popocatepetl reached the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Prevention Center recommended Mexicans move away from the volcano, after registering a peak of activity in the crater, with 183 gas and ash emissions in 24 hours.
The center monitored several rumblings and tremors from Popocatepetl.
On social media, the images showed thin layers of ash covering the windshields of cars in neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity at the volcano located 72 km from the capital, since an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.1 shook the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, nicknamed Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Catalonia: Clashes between police and separatists ahead of anniversary of independence vote
On Saturday, six arrests took place in Barcelona after clashes between pro-independence protesters and riot police, as thousands of opponents joined protests to mark the first anniversary of the referendum that divided Catalonia.
Before being turned away by riot police, masked separatists threw eggs and colored powder at them, creating clouds of dust in the streets, which usually do not empty tourists.
Clashes also erupted later in the day, while police used batons to contain the clashes.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanting "neither oblivion nor forgiveness" faced unionist supporters shouting "Long live Spain".
14 demonstrators with minor injuries were treated, according to local media.
One year after the referendum of 1 October, deemed illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalans in favour of separation, tensions are still high in the independence region.
An overwhelming majority of voters chose independence, despite a low turnout, with opponents of secession largely boycotting the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to prevent Catalans from accessing polling stations in the region.
Independence groups had camped out on Friday night to block a demonstration in support of the national police.
It was still there, but she was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who was taking part with his wife in the separatist demonstration, said he no longer had any hope for Catalonia's independence.
“Last year we witnessed a great moment.
My parents were crying with joy at the idea of being able to vote, but now we are at a dead end,” he laments.
Despite their capital victory, albeit slim, in regional elections last December, the pro-independence Catalan parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year, with many popular leaders exiled or detained pending trial for organising the referendum and declaring Catalonia’s independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who is filming the demonstration in support of the police on his phone, believes that politicians are responsible for blocking the situation, on one side or the other.
“The tension is only rising,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in jail awaiting trial since last year, announced his intention to run for the European Parliament elections next year.
“This is for me the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression unleashed by the Spanish government,” he adds.
Arrest in Londonderry: Men hit a house by car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after driving several times into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7:30 p.m. local time.
Police Capt. Bob Blemmings said the doors and walls were damaged.
The car was also reportedly shot with an arrow.
Livingston wins Game 1-0 against the Rangers thanks to Menga
Dolly Menga's first goal secures Livingston's win
Recently promoted, Livingston surprised the Rangers with a second win in 18 games for Steven Gerrard, the current Ibrox coach.
Menga's goal made all the difference and allowed Gary Holt's team to place 2nd in the standings, tied with Hibernian.
Gerrard's men are without a home win in the Premiership this season, and face the Hearts on Sunday, who lead by 8 points.
But before, the Rangers will meet the Rapid of Vienna on the occasion of the Europa League this Thursday.
As for the Livingston team, it extends by 6 games its undefeated course in the division, and its head coach Holt, who replaces Kenny Miller since last month, can boast of having not yet lost a single match.
Livingston missed an opportunity in the face of blunt opponents
Holt's team could have taken a lead long before scoring, as their direct approach put the Rangers in trouble.
Scott Robinson tried to break through but was stuck in front of the opponent's goal; followed by a late intervention by Alan Lithgow, on a header by Craig Halkett.
The Livingston team let the Rangers own the ball, knowing they could get in their way through elaborate tactics.
This is where the decisive goal came in.
The Rangers conceded a free-kick and Livingston attempted an opening; Declan Gallagher and Robinson teamed up to corner Menga, who took a touch and scored a midfield goal.
At this point, the Rangers dominated the game but found themselves facing an impenetrable defense and goaltender Liam Kelly was rarely worried.
The second half had the same pace, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to a stop.
Rangers goaltender Allan McGregor stopped Scott Pittman's kick, while Lithgow managed to foil one of Livingston's plans.
The Livingston goalkeeper rebuffed all attempts and protected his cage, while two penalties were denied by the referee, one for Halkett's provocation directed against Glenn Middleton and the other for a hand foul.
The Livingston "phenomenon" - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
Breathtaking performance and results for Livingston.
They have all been excellent and continue to exceed expectations on this upward slope.
Their style and team composition have hardly changed since returning to the top, but the credit goes largely to Holt for having motivated a team since his arrival.
It has many great players.
Captain Halkett’s defense was grandiose and beautifully organized, and Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes for the duration of the game.
Unfortunately, the Rangers were not inspired.
Despite a good level achieved with Gerrard, they did not live up to their past talent.
They missed one last opportunity and only managed to break through the opposing side once; this is a warning for the Rangers, who find themselves in the middle of the table.
President Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an’s mixed welcome in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, Turkish and German leaders met over breakfast in Berlin in a relaxed atmosphere.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aimed to improve relations between NATO allies.
Various issues were discussed, such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then flew to Cologne for the inauguration of one of the largest mosques.
One of the largest Turkish communities abroad lives in this city.
Citing security concerns, police prevented 25,000 demonstrators from gathering in front of the building, while many supporters were able to approach to see their president.
Hundreds of mostly Kurdish anti-Erdogan protesters have made their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him to his country.
The split that emerges from the protests reflects Erdogan’s dual vision: a visitor welcomed as a hero by some Germans of Turkish origin and called an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies after a collision with a car
In London, a cyclist died in a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred at about 10:15 a.m. local time, near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road from Deptford southeast of the city.
The driver of the vehicle stopped, rescuers arrived at the scene, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
The accident occurred several months after the death of a cyclist on Chiders Street, about a mile (1.5 km) from the accident that occurred on Saturday.
London police said officers were making every effort to identify the individual and warn his relatives.
Roads have been closed and bus detours have been set up. Motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: 6 Officers Injured in Riot
The head of the high-security men's prison said six prison officers had been injured in a riot.
The riot began in Worcestershire's HMP Long Lartin prison at around 9:30 a.m. local time on Sunday and is still not under control.
Specialized riot police officers were sent to unblock the situation, involving 8 detainees and contained in one wing of the prison.
Officers were treated for minor injuries to the face.
A prison management spokesman said: “Specially trained personnel have been deployed to restore order in the HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six officers were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons. Those responsible will have to answer to the police authorities and will be able to see their sentences extended.”
More than 500 prisoners, including criminals considered the most dangerous in the country, are incarcerated in the HM Long Lartin prison.
In June, the director of the prison was hospitalized following an assault by a prisoner.
In October last year, riot police were sent to the prison to stop a serious disturbance: prisoners attacked staff with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa: Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City threatened by flash floods (which could be beneficial for drought-affected areas)
It's rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that's likely to happen early next week. Hurricane Rosa is heading for the southwestern desert with what's left of its energy, which could be hit by flash floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, with forecast rain starting Monday night.
The Phoenix-based National Weather Service said in a tweet that “only ten tropical cyclones have retained the depression or tropical storm stage within a 300 km perimeter around Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) had stopped 40 miles from the Arizona border.
The latest estimates from the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 cm of precipitation, and up to 15 cm in places in the Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are expected to record 2.5 to 5 cm of precipitation, with isolated total measurements of up to 10 cm.
The Rosa rains could be life-saving for drought-affected areas that are not exposed to the risk of flash flooding.
Although the risk of flooding should not be taken lightly, rain could be beneficial for the southwest region given the current drought situation.
According to the U.S. drought monitoring system, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least one extreme category drought, the second most severe category.
Hurricane Rosa begins its journey on the coasts of the Baja California Peninsula.
Still of great power on Sunday morning and generating winds of up to 135 km/h, Rosa was located 620 km from Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and moves north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm meets the cold waters of the Pacific and therefore loses its strength.
It is expected to reach the Mexican coast with the force of a hurricane on Monday afternoon or Monday night.
In some areas of Mexico, rainfall could be massive and result in a risk of flooding.
"In total, between 7.5 and 15 cm of precipitation is expected from Baja California northwest of Sonora and can reach up to 25 cm," said weather.com.
Rosa will then cross Mexico northward, with the force of a tropical storm, and reach the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression. She will cross Arizona and southern Utah on Tuesday evening.
“Torrid rains are expected in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the southwestern desert and are the main hazard,” the National Hurricane Center said.
It is estimated that this precipitation will result in life-threatening flash floods and debris flows in arid areas, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on charges of attempted murder, after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace neighborhood of Midsomer Norton, Saturday around 4 a.m. local time.
He was sent to the hospital, his condition is currently stable.
Avon and Somerset Police said they arrested the four young men (aged 17, 18 and 20) in the night on the Radstock side.
Officers issued a call to people who may have filmed the scene with their phones.
Trump says Kavanaugh has fallen victim to Democrats’ malice and anger
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and outrageous methods of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump claimed that Kavanaugh had been a victim of the Democrats’ malice and anger throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh spoke before Congress on Thursday, energetically and emotionally rejecting allegations by Christine Blasey Ford, who accuses him of sexually assaulting her decades ago, when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing.
The president said Saturday that “the American people witnessed Kavanaugh’s intelligence and courage” on that day.
“A vote in the direction of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote in the direction of one of the most accomplished jurists with a brilliant career in public service,” he told the crowd of supporters gathered in West Virginia.
The president made indirect reference to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke of the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I’m not a candidate, but I’m more involved than ever,” he said.
“That’s why I’m fighting on all fronts for great candidates.”
Trump said the Democrats were on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
The first decisive procedural vote in the Senate for Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected to take place by Friday, according to a Republican party aide’s statement to CNN.
Indonesia: Earthquake and tsunami kill hundreds, death toll continues to rise
On Saturday, authorities said at least 384 people had died, most washed away by huge waves that hit beaches as an earthquake, followed by a tsunami, struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the beach in Palu, when waves six meters high submerged the beach at nightfall, taking many lives and destroying everything in their path.
The earthquake, with a magnitude of 7.5, preceded the tsunami.
"When the tsunami threat came yesterday, everyone was still on the beach, people didn't flee immediately, it cost them their lives," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), told a news conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, it brought cars, pieces of wood, houses, it took everything with it,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami moved in the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people were able to save their lives by climbing trees, he adds.
Nearly 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial images released by the disaster management agency show destroyed buildings and shops, deformed and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The aftershocks continued to shake the coastal city Saturday.
The earthquakes were felt by 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Assessment and Application of Technologies (BPPT) said the energy released by Friday’s earthquake was 200 times greater than the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city’s geographical location, which borders a long narrow bay, could have amplified the size of the tsunami, she explained.
According to Nugroho, the damage is considerable; thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have collapsed.
Bodies were found trapped under the rubble of ruined buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho said the human and material losses could be greater over the 300 km of coastline north of Palu, an area called Donggala, the closest to the earthquake's epicenter.
Communications were “completely paralyzed” from Donggala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
“The situation is dramatic and could well get worse,” she added.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticised for not releasing information that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived by the time the alert was issued.
An amateur video shared on social media shows a man on the floor of a building frantically yelling at passers-by on the street as a tsunami approaches.
A few minutes later, a wall of water came crashing down on the coast, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately authenticate the images.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a general power outage that cut off all communications in Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
The army has begun delivering aid by cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, according to authorities, but the evacuees are still in dire need of food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has reopened as part of rescue operations, but will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was due to visit the Palu evacuation centers on Sunday.
In Indonesia, the death toll from the tsunami has risen to more than 800.
It's a tragedy.
World Vision staff from Donggala arrived safely in Palu, where they found shelter in tarpaulin shelters set up in the backyard of their offices, and along the way discovered scenes of devastation, Doseba said.
“They told me they saw many houses destroyed,” he said.
It's a tragedy.
When aid groups began to help the victims, some complained that highly experienced foreign aid workers had not been allowed to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funds, supplies and personnel can enter the territory only if the affected site is declared a national disaster zone.
And that is not the case yet.
“This disaster is still considered regional,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government declares this to be a national disaster, international assistance will be able to intervene. But we are still waiting.”
When the second night after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami fell on Palu, relatives of the missing people were still hoping for a miracle.
On Saturday, a little boy was found in the sewers.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman buried under the rubble for two days, near the body of her mother.
Indonesia's national paragliding team coach Gendon Subandono had prepared two of the missing athletes for the Asian Games, which took place a few days earlier in Indonesia.
Other of his students found themselves trapped in the Roa Roa hotel, Mandagi added.
“As an elder in the discipline of paragliding, I experienced my own dramas,” he explains.
In the hours following the announcement of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel in the paragliding community, Gendon said he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to athletes in Palu attending the festival on the beach.
His messages remained unanswered.
“I don’t think they’ve ever received my messages.”
In Newport on the Levee, thieves steal $26,750 when reloading a vending machine
On Friday morning, thieves extorted $26,750 from a Brink's agent who was charging a vending machine in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the vehicle was emptying a vending machine in the entertainment complex and preparing to power it, Detective Inspector Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
While he was busy, a man appeared behind the Brink's employee and stole a bag of money meant for the distributor.
Witnesses reportedly saw many suspects leave the scene, but police did not say how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities is asked to contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is now known as Ye.
To announce the news on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “Formerly known as Kanye West.”
The 41-year-old West, who has been calling himself Ye for some time, used the nickname as a title for his eighth album, released in June.
The rapper made this change just before heading to the Saturday Night Live show, where he is expected to present his new album, Yandhi.
Her participation replaces that of Ariana Grande, who canceled her appearance for "emotional reasons", explained the creator of the show.
In addition to being shorthand for his current professional alias, this moniker also has religious significance for West.
“I think ‘Ye’ is the most used word in the Bible, where it means ‘you,’” West explained earlier this year, referring to the title of his album with his host Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us.
I went from Kanye, which means “the only one,” to Ye – the reflection of good, evil, confusion, everything.
This album is a reflection of who we are.”
West is not the only known rapper to change his name.
Sean Combs called himself Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has collaborated with West in the past, has also played on the hyphen and uppercase.
In Mexico, AMLO declared that he would never use military force against civilians.
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians, nearly fifty years after bloody reprisals by law enforcement against students.
Lopez Obrador vowed Saturday in Tlatelolco Square to “never use military force to repress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, troops opened fire during a pacifist demonstration, killing 300 people as student movements took root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador is committed to supporting Mexican youth by providing monthly stipends to students and opening more free public universities.
According to him, unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are pushing young people to join criminal gangs.
The United States should double funding in the field of artificial intelligence
As China becomes increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its funding dedicated to research in this sector, according to investor and artificial intelligence expert Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These statements come after several U.S. government actors made AI-related announcements, while an official AI strategy is lacking in the United States.
In parallel, China presented its roadmap last year: it plans to become the leader in AI innovation by 2030.
“Double funding for AI research would be a good start, as all other countries are one step ahead of the U.S., and we’re looking for the next big discovery in AI,” Lee said.
Doubling the funding could double the chances that the next key step in AI will come from the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s largest AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the top-ranked American Othello player. He then joined the management team of Microsoft Research and became president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee has previously participated in technology competitions organized by the U.S. government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next competition would take place, in order to identify the visionaries.
According to Lee, American researchers often have to work hard to get funding from the government.
“It’s not China that’s appropriating academic leaders, it’s business,” Lee says.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have recruited top academics to work on AI.
Lee added that changes to immigration policies could also support U.S. AI efforts.
“I think green cards should be automatically given to AI researchers,” he says.
The State Council of China unveiled its plan to develop next-generation artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to members of academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower,” Lee explained.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is expected to involve industry and academy partners, and the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF is currently investing more than $100 million per year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation working to establish a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has taken no action for several months.
Macedonians take part in referendum on the name of their country
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia made their voices heard in a referendum on changing their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, which would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that had blocked Macedonia's application to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, one of whose provinces is called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbour represents a right on its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments signed an agreement based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents say the change would affect the ethical identity of Macedonia's majority Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov announced that he would not vote in the referendum and that a boycott campaign had raised doubts about obtaining a minimum turnout of 50% required to validate the referendum.
The referendum question was: “Are you for NATO and EU membership under the terms of the agreement signed with Greece?”
According to supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, this is the price to pay to join organizations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, which survived the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I have come today to vote for the future of my country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the aegis of the European Union. It means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, enough members of parliament said they would follow the result of the vote to make it decisive.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Electoral Commission announced that no irregularities had been detected at 1 p.m.
But turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% at the same time in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 which had mobilized 66% of registered voters at the end of the vote.
“I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko participated in the referendum and voted to change their name, in order to open the door to NATO and European Union membership, in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
At the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, is preparing a small stage and has seats in front of tents set up by those who will boycott the referendum.
“We want to enter the EU and NATO, but we want to enter through the big door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don’t want us as Macedonia, we can turn to China and Russia and participate in Eurasian integration.”
According to Prime Minister Zaev, membership in NATO will allow Macedonia to benefit from necessary investments. The unemployment rate in the country exceeds 20%.
"I think a large majority will be in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens want to join the EU and NATO," Zaev said after casting his ballot.
He added that a “yes” would be a “confirmation of our future.”
According to a poll released on Monday by the Institute for Policy Research of Macedonia, between 30 and 43 percent of voters intend to participate in the referendum, which is lower than the expected turnout rate.
Another poll, conducted by the Macedonian channel Telma, estimated participation at 57%.
70% of those intending to vote said they would vote "yes".
In order for the referendum to be valid, 50% of the votes plus one vote are required.
The failure of the referendum would be the first blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since it took power last May.
Decisive action: Manchester City’s Sergio Aguero makes his way through Brighton’s defence to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling beat Brighton defenders in Manchester and won the match 2-0 on Saturday at Manchester’s Etihad Stadium.
Aguero's goal, in the 65th minute, seemed to be the simplest action in the world for the player.
The Argentine striker received the ball in the middle of the field, at the beginning of the action.
He ran between three Brighton defenders, before diving into the field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green jerseys.
He bypassed a defender before evicting the others close to Brighton's goal.
Then he passed the ball to Sterling, on his left.
The English forward took the opportunity to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to trick Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot from the right side of the net.
“Aguero has some problems with his feet,” Pep Guardiola, the team’s coach, told reporters.
“We said he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored at that time.”
But it was Sterling who had given the Skyblues the initial advantage in the Premier League game,
In the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball directly on the court in Brighton.
He sent it on the left to Leroy Sane.
Sane made a few touches before leading Sterling to the second post.
The forward of the Skyblues sent the ball into the nets just before sliding off the field.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play troublemaker against the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the playoffs, there was no reason to embark on a new game.
But Scherzer, very competitive, hopes to play Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only in the event of a playoff game for the Rockies, real legends against the Los Angeles Dodgers of the Western Division of the National League.
The Rockies won 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still looking to secure their first division title.
“Even if this game is not at stake, we want to take the field in Denver, with that atmosphere, with the crowd, and against a team that will probably play at the highest level I will have to face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to participate?”
The Nationals have yet to announce a starting pitcher for Sunday, but would be inclined to give way to Scherzer in this situation.
Scherzer, for whom it would be the 34th start, will be in training on Thursday and will pitch on his usual rest day on Sunday.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 earned points average and 300 takedowns in 220 steps and two-thirds this season.
Trump's Interventions in West Virginia
The president alluded to the situation generated by his support for Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court by talking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
“All our actions will have an impact in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
It’s a major issue. I’m not a candidate, but I’m more involved than ever. That’s why I’m fighting on all fronts for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “You see this horrible, really horrible radical group of Democrats, you see it at work.
And they are determined to regain power by all means. See their wickedness.
They don't care who they hurt, who they crush to take power and control. That's what they want, power and control, and we're not going to give it to them."
The Democrats are on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
“You can see that over the last four days,” he added, before calling Democrats “angry, mean and lying.”
He spoke to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee and Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which earned him public booing.
“Do you remember his answer?”
Did you disclose the document?
Ha ha, of course.
No, no. I'm expecting one. It was very bad body language, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer the large community it once was.
He is not tolerant of those who express their ideas.
When activists from my local party’s Momentum movement voted to censor me, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the latest in a line of Labour MPs who are considered unwelcome for expressing our views.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received the same treatment because she spoke out against anti-Semitism.
As far as I'm concerned, I was censored because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe. Ironically, these are subjects for which Jeremy himself disagreed with previous leaders.
The notification for the Nottingham East Labour rally on Friday said: “We want the rally to be inclusive and productive.”
This is exactly what the Friday night general assemblies were like during my eight years as a Labour Party MP.
Unfortunately, today this is not the case with many gatherings and the promise of softer and more respectful policies has long since been forgotten, if it has ever been taken into account.
It has become clear that opinions to the contrary are no longer tolerated within the party; each opinion is judged on the basis of its acceptability by party leaders.
It started shortly after Jeremy came to power, and colleagues with whom I thought I shared the same political vision started to expect me to turn my jacket around and take positions that were the opposite of my convictions, whether it was on national security or the EU's internal market.
Every time I spoke publicly, and no matter what I said, there was an abusive tirade on social media, calling for withdrawal, denouncing the policies of the center, telling me that I should not be a member of the party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments that were addressed to me were political in nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of these colleagues, who face a flood of sexist or racist remarks every day, but who do not give up.
One of the most disappointing things about current politics is the normalization of different forms of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that large community, and the party is restricted by motions of no confidence and changes in the rules of selection.
I’ve been given a lot of advice over the last couple of years: look down, don’t express my ideas so loudly, and everything would be fine.
But this is not how I do politics.
I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy, because the negligence of the Thatcher government had caused my classroom to collapse. Since then, I have been keen to work for better public services for those who need them most, whether as a local councillor or a government minister.
I have never hidden my political ambitions, even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been disturbed by my political positions and by my differences with the present party officials.
All I would like to say to those who defended the motion on Friday is that the country is moving towards a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and public services. I think this is not really the time to waste time and energy debating my loyalty to the leader of the party.
My only message is not to Nottingham Momentum, it is to my constituents, whether Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of withdrawal or opportunism will prevent me from acting for the causes I advocate, which are your interests at all.
Chris Leslie is a Member of Parliament for Nottingham East.
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr remains undefeated
Two late attempts may have distorted the final result, but there is no doubt about it: Ayr deserved this triumph following the intense day match of the Scottish Rugby Union Championship.
The team now occupies the top of the standings and becomes the only undefeated team in the championship.
In the end, it is the superiority of their defense and the way they are seized the opportunities that allowed them to open the score. Coach Peter Murchie can congratulate himself on this match.
“So far we have been tested, but we remain undefeated, so I have to consider myself happy!” he said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, congratulated Ayr: “Bravo to them, they were more efficient than us and knew how to seize the opportunities.”
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute try, transformed by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in a good position, but a yellow card for Scotland's Rory Hughes, released for the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to get the numbers rolling.
Climo aggravated the situation for Ayr with a penalty, before, just at half time. He scored and turned a solo try to raise the score to 17-5 for Ayr at the break.
Melrose got off to a good start in the second half and Baggot-turned-Patrick Anderson's try cut the gap to five points.
This was followed by a long wait due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who left the field on a stretcher. During the recovery, Ayr regained the lead with a try by Stafford McDowall transformed by Climo.
Blair Macpherson, Ayr’s acting captain, was then given a yellow card and, again, Melrose tried his luck with an unprocessed attempt by Bruce Colvine, which created palpable tension.
But the home team recovered and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for hitting Climo when he didn't have the ball, from the penalty kick, MacPherson hit the back of Ayr's progressing maul.
Climo turned the test, as almost every time since the restart, after Kyle Rowe gathered David Armstrong's box kick and sent winger Gregor Henry away for the team's fifth home try.
The star of Still Game embarks on the restoration
Ford Kieran, the star of Still Game, decided to make a career in catering. The comedian was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the famous BBC show, which he writes and co-hosts with his longtime stage partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the show's finale, and Kiernan seems to be preparing for the post-Craiglang.
According to official records, he is a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, though a Scottish Sun source revealed that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the “flourishing restaurant scene” in Glasgow.
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, blocked, hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Sailors patrol in an armored boat in the naval headquarters La Paz.
Public buildings carry a blue flag like the ocean.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, naval bases display the following motorcycle: "The sea is rightfully ours.
Retrieving it is a duty.”
Throughout Bolivia blocked, the memory of a coast lost to Chile during a bloody resource conflict in the nineteenth century is still present. As is the desire to sail the Pacific Ocean, once again.
These hopes have not been so palpable for several decades, as Bolivia awaits a decision from the International Court of Justice, which will be rendered on 1 October, after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the will, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course expects a positive result," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the decision of the International Court of Justice on the big screen throughout the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will rule in favor of the Bolivian application. Bolivia wants that, after decades of sporadic negotiations, Chile be required to negotiate the agreement of a sovereign passage to the ocean to Bolivia.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president (who faces a controversial fight for re-election next year), also has a lot to say about Monday’s decision.
“We are so close to being able to return to the Pacific Ocean,” he said in late August.
But some analysts believe there is little chance that the court will rule in favor of Chile, and that little would change, even if a positive decision were made.
The Netherlands-based UN body does not have the power to grant Chilean territory, and has stipulated that it would not determine the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice handed down its decision six months after the last arguments shows that the case “was not complicated,” says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And far from favoring the Bolivian cause, the last four years may have even hurt it.
“The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration,” Zárate said.
Morales’ bellicose rhetoric undermined all remaining Chilean goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to exchange, but after that, it will be very complicated to organize talks.
The last exchange of ambassadors between the two countries took place in 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, who represents Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the Court’s decision-making was abnormally fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to “end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also disputed the fact that Morales — who remains to this day one of Latin America’s most popular presidents — was using the maritime issue as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The Court’s decision is an opportunity to see that we have to get rid of the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will only happen when it can trust the United States
Ri Yong Ho, North Korea's foreign minister, said his country would not get rid of its nuclear weapons until it trusted Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made at a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
He spoke as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo looks set to reignite deadlocked nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the Singapore summit with Kim Jong Un, the current leader of North Korea.
Ri said it was "chimerical" to think that continued sanctions and U.S. opposition to a declaration that would end the Korean War would make the North bow.
Washington is reluctant to accept the statement in the absence of significant prior disarmament measures from Pyongyang.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But Pyongyang’s seriousness about giving up an arsenal that the country sees as the only guarantee of its security is debated.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Paris Fashion Shows Unveil Latest Headwear Trends, May Soon Be Available in Your Stores
If you want to add XXL pieces to your hat collection or protect yourself from the 100% sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented their collections of delirious oversize hats during a PE19 show that honored the style of Paris Fashion Week.
More extravagant hats than any other invaded Instagram this summer, and the creators decided to incorporate their delirious pieces into the shows.
Valentino’s signature piece was an eccentric beige hat adorned with a broad feather-like edge, which engulfed the models’ heads.
Other oversized accessories included watermelons decked out in jewelry, a wizard's hat, and even a pineapple, but these pieces weren't designed to keep you warm.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of original masks. Just in time for Halloween.
Most of the masks had their lips sewn together and evoked Hannibal Lecter more than Haute Couture.
One creation resembled diving gear, with snorkel and goggles, while another resembled a cone of melted ice.
And if you follow fashion trends, then you are in luck.
According to style observers, the imposing hats could come up to your shopping streets.
The XXL hats follow in the wake of the “Bomba,” the wide-brimmed straw hat that stars tear off, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that markets this hard-to-wear hat that has flooded social networks has presented another of its flagship creations on the podium: a straw beach bag almost as large as the swimsuit model who wore it.
The burnt orange raffia bag, adorned with raffia fringes and a white leather handle, was the centerpiece of the PE19 La Riviera de Jacquemus show at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see the big hats and beach bags arrive in stores for next summer. The designer has so impressed that it is obvious that there will be demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: language skills are essential for the citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a record of academic excellence. This trend continued in 2018 with new excellent exam results reinforced by collective and individual success in sports, art, music and other community activities.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to provide the highest level of service to students and their parents.
Independent schools work to prepare their students for higher education, for the career they have chosen and for their place as global citizens.
As an education sector able to design and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we see that contemporary languages remain popular and desired subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you speak to his head.
If you speak to him in his language, you speak to his heart.”
This reminds us that we cannot rely on English to build relationships and build trust with people in other countries.
If we look at the excellent results in the exams this year, we see that languages are at the top of the ranking, with the highest success rates in independent schools.
In total, 68% of students who studied foreign languages received the highest grade, A.
The data, collected from the 74 SCIS member schools, show that 72% of students achieved the highest grade, A, in Mandarin, as did 72% of students who studied German, 69% of students who studied French and 63% of students who studied Spanish.
This shows that Scotland’s independent schools support foreign languages as absolutely essential skills for children and young people in the future.
From now on, languages as subjects are organized just like science, technology, engineering and mathematics in the curricula of independent schools and other schools.
A survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that 17% of the difficulties employers face in recruiting candidates are related to insufficient language skills.
Language skills are therefore increasingly vital to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more job offers requiring languages, these skills are essential in our globalized world.
Regardless of one’s career choice, a person who speaks a second language will enjoy a real advantage in the future thanks to this long-lasting skill.
Being able to communicate directly with foreigners will automatically place the multilingual person in front of their competitors.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom, 75% of them did not have enough knowledge of a foreign language to hold a conversation; French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage (15%).
This is why investing in language learning is important for children today.
By speaking several languages, including those of emerging economies, children will have a better chance of finding a rewarding job.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Many of them will focus on classical contemporary languages, while others will teach languages considered important for the United Kingdom in the perspective of 2020, including Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s preferences, several languages will be accessible in independent schools, with specialist staff in the field.
Independent schools in Scotland want to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
It is clear that, at the present time, in a global business environment, languages remain of paramount importance for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be considered as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scotland’s youth.
It has to be done.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron to make Lakers debut Saturday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans watching LeBron James make his Los Angeles Lakers debut.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play Sunday, in the preseason opener, against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It is not yet known how many minutes he will play.
“More than one, less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would likely play for a limited few minutes.
After training earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans for the pre-season schedule, which includes six games.
“At this point in my career, I don’t need pre-season games to be ready.”
Trump campaign in West Virginia (YouTube channel)
President Donald Trump begins a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Other stops, notably in states like Tennessee and Mississippi where the president is popular, are planned.
With the confirmation vote on the Supreme Court vacancy postponed, Trump is seeking to garner support for the upcoming midterm elections and prevent Republicans from losing control of Congress in the November vote.
What time is Trump’s rally in West Virginia tonight and how do you watch it online?
Trump’s meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow him online below, live on YouTube.
Trump is expected to address the issue of the hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, accused of sexual assault, which took place this week. Kavanaugh's confirmation vote in the Senate is expected to be postponed until a week during the FBI investigation.
But this series of meetings is primarily aimed at helping Republicans gain ground ahead of the November election.
The president said in his campaign that the five meetings were aimed at “encouraging volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majorities they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Congress control is such an essential part of his program that the president will travel to as many states as possible at the start of this busy election campaign,” a spokesman for the Trump team, who declined to be named, told Reuters.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, tonight's meeting, scheduled at Wheeling's Wesbanco Arena, could bring together supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract the attention of the Pittsburgh media."
On Saturday, it will be Trump’s second visit in a month to West Virginia, a state he won in 2016 by more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, who is lagging behind in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come and try to get him back in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA ready to fight for hope ahead of Sunday singles
After three singles, Saturday afternoon’s foursomes may well represent what was missing from this Ryder Cup.
The momentum balance movement is a sports concept invented from scratch but which players sincerely believe in, and more than ever at tournaments such as this one.
Where would they find the momentum now?
“They were leading by six points and now four, so that gives us a little bit of wings,” Spieth said as he left for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, with four points ahead and another twelve to play.
The Americans, according to Spieth, feel a bit windy and have every reason to be encouraged, especially by Spieth and Justin Thomas who have played together all day and can boast of having each scored three points out of four.
Spieth has been tremendously effective from tee to green and leads by example.
The energetic cheers intensified as his game progressed. A crucial putt allowed him to equalize in the fourth half as he and Thomas were led two down after two holes.
His putt, thanks to which they won the game at the 15th hole, raised a similar cry, from those who tell you that he believes the American team is still in the running.
“We really need to stay determined and focus on his game,” Spieth said.
That's all that's left for each of these players now.
18 holes to stand out.
The only players to score more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, as Ryder Cup history attests.
The strange but adorable European pair have won four out of four matches and are not entitled to the mistake.
Not only were “Moliwood” the only ones not to make a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also escaped on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the final nine holes on Friday morning.
This series, the way their energy seems to flow between them and the raving crowd designate them as the players to beat on Sunday, and there is no player more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari to delight in a potential European win as the sun sets on the National Golf Course.
Preferably, both at the same time at different holes.
But talking about European glory is still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly beat Sergio Garcia, the morning's fourball hero, as he teamed up with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first nine shots sent the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole from which they were never able to get out.
On Sundays, no one is there to help.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to watch closely because of the interactions between pairs, the advice they give and those they don’t, and how a strategy can flip in the blink of an eye.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a considerable lead during the last day, but this foursome session also proved that the Americans have the courage to fight, which some doubted, especially at home.
Europe lead 10-6 on final day of Ryder Cup
Europe will enjoy a solid lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup after beating the United States 10-6 in Saturday’s fourballs and foursomes.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two wins over a distressed Tiger Woods, allowing them to score four points so far.
Determined to keep the title she lost to Hazeltine two years ago, Thomas Bjorn's European team made the difference by winning 3-1 in the morning fourballs, against a disorderly American team.
The United States demonstrated greater resistance in the foursomes and won two victories, but they failed to close the gap.
Jim Furyk's men must score eight points out of 12 on Sunday's singles to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, while Molinari and he, nicknamed "Molliwood" after a smashing weekend, are only the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points in their first four games.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they flat-out beat the pair consisting of American rookie Bryson Dechambeau and an already tired Woods with an even more emphatic 5 and 4.
Woods, who dragged through both games on Saturday, has shone a few times, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in fourballs and foursomes, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, well rested for the morning fourballs, teamed up with Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, winning 2-1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, number one and three respectively in the world rankings.
Europe was not spared during the tournament that took place in the southwest of Paris, in cool but clear weather.
Triple winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans by scoring two points on Saturday.
They won a well-deserved 2-1 win against Spain’s Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and again beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the foursomes, the latter having lost the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team recovered from a four-point singles deficit, although Furyk's team, who held the crown, now have to draw to retain their trophy.
After being second for two days, however, they might not recover from a counterattack Sunday.
North Korea declares that disarmament can under “no circumstances” be done unilaterally without trust.
On Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations that continued sanctions were reinforcing his mistrust of the United States and that it would be impossible for his country to unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapons under the circumstances.
At the annual general assembly of the world body, Ri Yong Ho said North Korea had taken "important goodwill measures" last year, such as ending nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site and committing not to proliferate nuclear weapons and technology.
“However, we do not see any corresponding response from the United States,” he said.
In the absence of confidence in the United States, we will fear for our national security and, in such circumstances, it is excluded that we are the first to unilaterally disarm ourselves.”
While reiterating North Korea's well-known criticism of Washington's opposition to a "step-by-step" approach to denuclearization under which North Korea would be rewarded if it took steps gradually, his statement proved important in that it did not reject the idea of unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a June 12 joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump in Singapore at the first-ever summit between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader, when Kim pledged to work for a “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” while Trump promised to guarantee the security of North Korea.
North Korea is seeking to officially end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also turned down calls to ease tough international sanctions on North Korea.
The U.S. insists that North Korea first proceed with denuclearization and ratchets up the pressure by imposing sanctions to achieve its goal coercively, even opposing “the declaration of an end to the war.”
“Those who think that these sanctions can make us fold do not know us.
The problem is that maintaining sanctions increases our mistrust.”
Ri made no comment on the second summit between Kim and Trump highlighted to the United Nations by the US leader earlier this week.
Instead, the minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If the party concerned by the denuclearization issue was South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be at such a standstill.”
Still, the tone of Ri’s speech was radically different from last year’s, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable to point North Korean missiles at North American territory after “evil” President Trump called Kim a “missile man” on a suicide mission.
Trump, who had threatened last year at the United Nations to “totally destroy” North Korea, did not mince words of praise this year for the courage with which Kim applied measures for disarmament, but added that there was still much to be done and that sanctions would not be lifted until North Korea disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said that no deadline had been set. "It can take two years, three years or five months; it doesn't matter," he said.
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that “the implementation of Security Council sanctions must be firmly and systematically maintained until full, final and verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously tightened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to stifle funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then announced that he would travel to Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was somewhat disastrous.
In July, he left Pyongyang saying progress had been made, but within hours North Korea denounced his “gangster methods.”
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile site as well as a nuclear complex if the United States took “equivalent measures.”
According to the South Korean president, Kim is demanding the security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore, and efforts to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard: students take rest classes
This year, Harvard University has introduced a new course that allows all undergraduate students to sleep more and fights the growing machismo trend of studying by consuming caffeine all night long.
A professor noticed that most students at the best university in the world don’t know how to take care of themselves
The course, designed by Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is the first of its kind in the United States.
It was after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning that the idea came to him.
At the end, a student approached me and said, "Why am I only told this in the last year?"
She claimed that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
First offered this year, this course explains to students the need to adopt good sleep habits to improve their academic and physical performance, as well as their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director general of the university’s health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding that students suffered from a severe lack of sleep during the week.
The course consists of different interactive exercises.
One of the sections presents the image of a dormitory containing different objects (coffee cups, curtains, sneakers, books...) on which students click to know the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on their physical performance and the importance of integrating a routine before bedtime.
In another section, participants learn how lack of long-term sleep can increase the risks of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons then invites participants to reflect on their daily routine.
“We know it won’t instantly change student behavior.
However, in our view, they have a right to know this information – in the same way that you have a right to know what the health effects of smoking are,” Professor Czeisler added.
According to him, the culture of “sleeping through the night” pride still exists, and he adds that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students make lack of sleep a growing problem.
Getting enough, good-quality sleep should be the students’ “secret weapon” to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said — even to avoid gaining weight, as lack of sleep puts the brain into starvation mode, making them permanently hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California chemistry and physical biology student, helped Professor Czeisler design this course after being one of his students last year, during his freshman year at Harvard.
He claimed that this course had opened his eyes and pushed him to insist that it be offered to the entire campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to offer all postgraduate students a similar program of study before joining the reputable institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students plan an alarm for both bedtime and wake-up time, and be aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED light, which can disrupt their circadian rhythm and lead to sleep disturbances.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga's goal brings down Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another blow on the outside, with Dolly Menga's attack leading Steven Gerrard's disjointed team to a 1-0 loss at Livingston.
The Ibrox team had hoped to record its first away win since its 4-1 triumph in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted Gerrard his second loss in 18 games as a coach, leaving his team adrift, eight points behind the Ladbroke Premiership-leading Hearts.
Menga hit seven minutes before halftime and the Rangers team, short on inspiration, failed to equalize.
With the Rangers now falling to sixth place, Livingston moved up to third, just behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And other difficulties could be felt for the Rangers, referee Calum Spence having to be treated for a head injury following the throwing of an object from the opposite side.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which swept Ayr in the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Holt, meanwhile, picked the same Livi 11 who snatched a point from the Hearts last week and would have been delighted to see his well-trained team choking his opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have mastered possession of the ball, but Livingston has done more.
They should have scored within two minutes, when Menga's first shot sent Scott Pittman on Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder let his luck slip.
Keaghan Jacobs then fired a powerful shot towards Captain Craig Halkett, but his defenceman teammate Alan Lithgow was only able to reach the second post
The Rangers managed to take control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should have received a penalty after the free-kick when he and Steven Lawless collided, but referee Steven Thomson ruled out the Colombian's demands.
The Rangers only took advantage of two shots in the first period, but former Ibrox goaltender Liam Kelly was barely bothered by Lassana Coulibaly and a shot from Ovie Ejaria.
If the opening of the score by Livi in the 34th minute registered against the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it because of their hard work.
Again, the Rangers failed in Jacobs's stop kick.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher handed the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool to choose Menga for an end in simplicity.
Gerrard responded at halftime by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the exchange almost had an immediate impact when the winger showed up in front of Morelos, but the impressive Kelly rushed to make a block.
Livingston continued to push visitors to play exactly the type of game they love, with Lithgow and Halkett sweeping long balls on long balls.
Holt's team could have taken the lead in the final moments, but McGregor did well to push back Jacobs before Lithgow missed the goal.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton once again claimed a late penalty while battling Jacobs, but Thomson again ignored him.
Almanach: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: On September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and THE COMPUTER TURNS... was born the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity; an invention that later gave rise to the device known as the Geiger counter.
A pillar of science since then, the Geiger counter has also become fundamental in pop culture, as can be seen in the 1950 film “Bells of Coronado,” starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, two unlikely scientists:
A man: “What is that?”
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, it's used to look for radioactive minerals, like uranium.
Thanks to these headphones, we can actually hear the effects of the atoms released into the minerals by the radioactivity.”
Evans: “Say, it sure jumps out there!”
“Hans” Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name remains.
New Cancer Vaccine Enables Immune System to ‘Detect’ Cancer Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Enables Immune System to ‘Detect’ Cancer Cells and Kill Them
As part of the treatment, the vaccine tells the immune system how to recognize cancer cells
This technique involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory.
They can then “detect” a protein that is common to many cancers, and are then reinjected.
An experimental vaccine shows encouraging results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who received the vaccine, whose goal is to teach the immune system to recognize cancer cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory, so that they can detect the HER2 protein, common to many cancers, and finally reinject them.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the US National Cancer Institute based in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.”
According to Professor Berzofsky, the HER2 protein “causes an increase in several types of cancer”, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer.
A similar approach, which involves taking immune cells to “teach” them how to target cancer cells, has been proven in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Wearing a MAGA cap, Kanye West embarked on a Pro-Trump rant after his time at SNL.
It didn't go well
Kanye West was booed on set after a rampaging performance during which he praised US President Donald Trump on a Saturday Night Live and announced that he would run for office in 2020.
After his third track, Ghost Town, which he sang wearing a Make America Great Again cap, West went after the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“A lot of times I talk to white people and they say, ‘How can you love Trump?
“Well, if racism worried me, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL show kicked off with a Matt Damon skit in which the Hollywood star mocks Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the recording of West's diatribe was relayed on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
We don’t know if Rock intended to make fun of West with this release.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had spent a bad quarter of an hour behind the scenes because of his cap.
“They put pressure on me.
They told me not to come with that cap on my head.
They put pressure on me!
And then they say I’m in a chasm,” he says, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see him, the chasm?" and claimed that he would wear his Superman cape, because no one can dictate his actions to him.
Try the love.”
His comments drew booing at least twice from the public and the SNL members seemed embarrassed, reports Variety. An on-site person told the magazine: "A deadly silence fell across the entire set."
West had been called in at the last minute to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West unhinged many people by singing the song I Love it in a Perrier bottle costume.
West received support from TPUSA Conservative group leader Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest minds: THANK YOU FOR HEADING THE CROW."
But Karen Hunter, the host of the show, tweeted that West was simply “loyal to himself, and that’s absolutely wonderful.”
“However, I choose not to reward someone (by buying their music, their clothes or by supporting their art) who, in my opinion, adopts and pours out an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And so do we,” she added.
Prior to the show, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and claimed that he was now "officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapper Snoop Dogg was named after Snoop Lion and of course the legendary late Prince, who changed his name to symbol, then that of the artist previously known as Prince.
Belfast: Charge of attempted murder after stabbing in restaurant
A 45-year-old man is charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed last Friday in a restaurant east of Belfast.
According to police, the incident happened in Ballyhackamore.
The accused is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington takes on toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as thin-skinned Jon Snow in Game of Thrones, HBO’s violent medieval fantasy series.
But the 31-year-old actor has taken on the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such on-screen roles often lead young boys to pose as tough guys to be respected.
In an interview with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes "something is wrong" and addresses the issue of toxic masculinity at the time of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married 31-year-old Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, said he "strongly" wants to address the issue.
“Personally, I deeply believe that we have abused masculinity.”
“What lessons have we given to young men who are becoming adults, in relation to the problem that now arises?”
According to Kit, television could be partly responsible for the rise in toxic masculinity because of its very masculine characters.
He continued, “What behavior is innate, what behavior has been instilled?
What does television and the street teach young boys that they must behave this way to be a man?
I think that’s really one of the fundamental questions of our time – how can we change that?
There’s obviously something wrong.”
In the interview, he also confessed that he would not do prologues or sequels when the series ends next summer, claiming to have finished with "the battlefields and the horses".
Starting in November, Kit will star in a cover of Sam Shepard’s True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that meeting his wife Rose was for him the best thing that happened to him in Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife on this show, so she offered me my future family and my life from now on,” he says.
Rose played Ygritte, the lover of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 in Scotland, at Leslie's family estate.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14 per cent increase in the number of its people living with HIV and AIDS.
According to Chinese health authorities, more than 820,000 people are affected.
Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported during the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the patients have been infected during sexual intercourse, which is a new fact.
Historically, the virus has spread rapidly in parts of the country following contaminated blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been practically reduced to zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference held in Yunnan province.
However, from one year to the next, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
In the Chinese LGBT community, the transmission of HIV through sexual intercourse is a serious problem.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community remains widespread.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that 70 to 90 percent of gay men end up marrying a woman.
Many cases of transmission are due to inadequate sexual protections.
As part of its efforts to combat this problem, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines since 2003.
Maxine Waters denies that a GOP employee disclosed data on senators, and denounces "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories."
On Saturday, U.S. Republican Maxine Waters denounced allegations that a member of her team published personal information about three Republican senators on Wikipedia pages devoted to lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the statements were backed by experts and “far-right” websites.
“Lies, lies, and more infamous lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The leaked information appeared to include the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information was posted Thursday by a stranger on Capitol Hill during the Senate hearing on sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
According to Hill, conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the messages was associated with the Waters office and disclosed the information of a Waters staff member.
According to Waters, “this unsubstantiated claim is completely false and an absolute lie.”
“The member of my team, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised due to these fraudulent and false allegations, is in no way responsible for the leak of this information.”
“This false claim is completely false and a real lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly drew criticism online, including from Ari Fleischer, the former White House press secretary.
“This denial is anger,” he wrote.
“It indicates that she doesn’t have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something they did not do, they should not be angry.
It should not be provocative.
It must not call into question the motives of the accuser.
She must remain calm and serene.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, accused of appearing too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate for the Waters seat in the midterm elections, also shared his thoughts on Twitter.
“If it’s true, it’s huge,” he wrote on Twitter.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted “the relevant law enforcement authorities and services” about these fraudulent claims.
“We will ensure that the culprits are exposed,” she added, “and that they are held accountable for all their destructive and dangerous acts for all members of my team.”
Johnny English hit again. Parody of Rowan Atkinson, under-gifted spy
It has now become a tradition to research the scope of Brexit in any new British film and this seems to apply to this revival of the action comedy Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and resurfaced in 2011 with Johnny English, the comeback.
Will the ironic self-satisfaction on the question of the evidence of our insignificance represent our country’s new export opportunity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, wide-eyed and rubber-faced, has seen his license renewed for the second time in a confusing context - this name indicating above all that it is a great comic creation designed for a non-English-speaking film-loving audience.
Of course, he is the stupid secret agent who, despite his dubious attempts at glamorous charmer, possesses a bit of Clouseau, a hint of Mr Bean and a good dose of the type who performs a small note in The Chariots of Fire during the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
Originally, it was also inspired by the international traveler and mystery man Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, leaving chaos behind.
The last Johnny English has one or two nice moments.
I liked Johnny English approaching a helicopter while he was wearing medieval armor and the rotor blades were briefly hitting against his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is highlighted, although the humor is rather insufficient and strangely superfluous, especially at a time when "serious" licenses like 007 and Mission Impossible compose themselves confidently with comedy.
The humor seems more child-oriented than adult-oriented, and to me, Johnny English’s wacky misadventures are less creative and less focused than Atkinson’s silent-movie gags in Bean’s character.
The perpetually topical premise is that Britain has serious problems.
A hacker has infiltrated the super-secret web network of British spies, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, much to the dismay of the agents on duty – a role unfortunately of small scope for Kevin Eldon.
It’s the straw that breaks the camel’s back for a prime minister who’s a pompous character on the verge of crisis and already suffering from a political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best with this near-Teresa-May character, but there’s not much to get under the skin in the script.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that every active spy has been compromised, she will have to get someone out of retirement.
This means disturbing Johnny English himself, who is now employed in a posh establishment as a schoolteacher, but who secretly gives lessons on how to become a secret agent: some nice pranks here, because English offers a Rock Academy-style espionage academy.
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunites with his longtime partner Bough, once again encamped by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, attached to a submarine commander, a fun hockey stick role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So Batman and Robin, who are creating big trouble for Her Majesty's secret services, go back into action and meet Olga Kurylenko, the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls dangerously under the spell of the charismatic tech billionaire who says he can solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough launch their odyssey of wacky jokes: under the guise of waiters, they set fire to a dazzling French restaurant; they create chaos by sneaking onto Volta's luxurious sailboat; and English sets off a veritable anarchy when he tries, with a virtual reality headset, to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
All stops are assured for this last sequence, but despite everything, there is a lot for the children in all this.
A rather moderate film.
I couldn’t help but think, as with the other Johnny English films: can’t the British film industry offer Rowan Atkinson a role that will really value his talent?
Labour denies drawing up a plan for Britons to be able to work four days but be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party must consider a radical plan that will allow Britons to work four days a week – but get paid for five.
Apparently, the party wants business leaders to give workers the savings generated by artificial intelligence (AI) by giving them an extra day off.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend, while still receiving the same salary.
According to some sources, the idea would be in line with the party's economic program and plans to orient the country in favor of workers.
The move to a four-day week was approved by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to take advantage of economic changes.
A senior Labour Party source told the Sunday Times: “A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.”
“It won’t happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is a goal that goes hand in hand with the party’s approach to rebalancing the economy in favor of workers as well as its overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party was committed to a four-day workweek during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day working week is not party policy and is not envisaged by the party."
Acting Chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of last week’s Labour conference to give details on his vision for a socialist revolution of the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from "anonymous directors" and "profiteers" in public utilities.
The alternate chancellor's plans also provide that the current shareholders of the water companies may not recover their entire stake since the Labour government could make "deductions" due to alleged misconduct.
He also confirmed his plan to integrate workers on company boards as well as the creation of an inclusive shareholder fund that will pay out 10% of private company capital to employees, who will pocket up to <0xC2><0xA3>500 in dividends per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell 60 Minutes if the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The final vote on Brett Kavanaugh’s appointment to the Supreme Court has been delayed by at least a week following the FBI’s investigation into the charges against him and raises the question of whether the Bureau’s findings could prompt Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview aired Sunday, Scott Pelley, the 60 Minutes correspondent, asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could discover anything that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
“Obviously,” Kennedy said.
“On my way to the hearing, I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, when these allegations were made, and I asked him, “Did you do that?”
He was determined, determined, unequivocal.”
However, Graham’s vote seems to be set in stone.
“I made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and it would require an explosive charge,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it outright,” Graham added, alluding to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And the people she appoints couldn’t verify it.
It's a 36-year-old case.
I don’t see anything new changing.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with an impressive list of stars and an equally impressive mission: to end poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flocking to the Great Lawn of Central Park to not only benefit from the performance of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the festival’s true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, first held in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (unless you’re willing to pay for a VIP ticket), spectators had to complete a series of tasks, or “actions,” such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, calling, or making any other useful effort to raise awareness of the fight against poverty.
But to what extent can the Global Citizen organization still achieve its goal in the remaining twelve years?
Does the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really persuade them to demand a call to action, or is it just another example of “clictivism” – where people actually think they can make a difference by signing a petition or tweeting?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters, who advocate for many different goals.
According to the organization, these actions have helped inspire world leaders to make commitments and adopt policies amounting to more than $37 billion that are expected to change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements arising from its shares, of which a tranche of at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK partnership of investors and implementers committed to “helping children reach their full potential”, while promising Rwanda <0xC2><0xA3>35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 messages from Global Citizens.
“Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of undernutrition a footnote in history,” Tracey Ullman, ambassador for The Power of Nutrition programme, told the crowd at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that following the undertaking of more than 5,000 actions to ask the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government has announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will benefit 5 million women and children through nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on its website, “what makes you think it’s possible to end extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen said: “The road to get there will be long and difficult, sometimes we will fall and fail.
However, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists who will perform this year in New York, where Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will animate the show.
U.S. could call on Navy to create 'blockade' to hinder Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
In order to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, Washington can “if necessary” call on the U.S. Navy, revealed Ryan Zinke, the U.S. Secretary of the Interior, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke said Russia’s presence in Syria – including where it operates at the request of the legitimate government – is a pretext for it to explore new energy markets.
“I believe they are in the Middle East with the aim of negotiating energy as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern center of Europe,” he said.
According to the official representative, there are ways to remedy this.
“The United States can, with our Navy, ensure that the sea lanes are open and, if necessary, obstruct them to ensure that their power is not placed on the market,” he added.
Zinke spoke to attendees at the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that describes itself as the “spokesperson for energy consumers” in the United States.
He compared Washington’s approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, pointing out that they are actually identical.
“As far as Iran and Russia are concerned, the economic option more or less lies in the exploitation and replacement of fuels,” he said, while referring to Russia as having “more than one rope to its bow” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come as the Trump administration has pledged to boost the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a much cheaper solution for European consumers.
To do this, representatives of the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to get out of the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which according to Trump, makes the city of Berlin “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double current capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin says Washington’s fervent opposition to the project is simply motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
In a September speech in Moscow following a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said, “I believe we share this view that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers.”
The position of the United States has provoked negative reactions from Germany, which has reaffirmed its involvement in this project.
Germany's main industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States not to get involved in European energy policy or bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a huge problem when a third country interferes in our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, the head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider running in 2020 presidential election, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren announced Saturday that she will seriously consider running in the presidential election following the midterm elections.
At a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running.
“The time has come for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and for that, a woman will have to be at the top,” she says, according to The Hill.
“After November 6, I will seriously consider running for president.”
Warren said what she thought of President Donald Trump at the public rally, saying he was “driving this country in the wrong direction.”
“I’m very worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren was outspoken in her criticism of Trump and Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet Friday, Warren said: “Obviously we need an FBI investigation before we vote.”
However, a poll released Thursday showed that a majority of Warren voters do not believe she should run in 2020.
According to the poll by the University of Suffolk and Boston Globe Political Research Center, 58% of Massachusetts’ “probable” voters said the senator should not run.
32% were in favour of such a campaign.
The poll found that former Governor Deval Patrick was more supportive, with 38% in favor of a potential campaign and 48% against it.
Other high-profile Democratic names that have been raised for a potential 2020 campaign include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would make a formal decision by January.
Sarah Palin discusses Track Palin’s PTSD during Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
On Monday evening, he was arrested and charged in connection with a domestic violence incident.
“What my own son is feeling right now, what he’s feeling on his way home, I can relate to other families who are feeling the consequences of PTSD and some of the injuries that our soldiers are coming back with,” she told the audience at the rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a “taboo subject” and said of his son and other veterans that “they come back a little different, hardened, wondering if we’re respecting what their comrades and the air force members, and every other military member, have given to the country.”
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Service, he was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with assault and domestic violence on a woman, interfering with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while drunk.
18 states and the District of Columbia are in favor of a legal challenge to the new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia are in favor of a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
On Friday in Washington, representatives from 18 states and the district filed a brief in favor of an asylum seeker who challenged the policy, NBC News reported.
The complainant's full name in Grace v. Sessions, which was opened in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy, was not disclosed.
She said her partner “and her sons, members of violent gangs,” assaulted her, but U.S. authorities decided to reject her asylum claim on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
Prosecutors from states that support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum claims in the United States, as countries facing widespread gang and domestic violence problems.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Immigrant Appeals Board that allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal and international law.”
“Federal law stipulates that all asylum claims must be examined according to the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a prohibition violates this principle,” the amicus curiae said in its brief.
Lawyers also argued in the brief that the policy of denying immigrants entry hurts the U.S. economy, arguing that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary work."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
“Asylum is granted to people who leave their home country because of persecution or fear on the grounds of race, belief, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political beliefs,” Sessions said in his June 11 announcement of the policy.
“Asylum has never been designed to alleviate all of the problems — even the most serious ones — that people face every day around the world.”
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is increasingly dramatic.
“I feel very tense,” Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said as she comforted her feverish little boy in Palu, at an evacuation center in the emptied city.
“At every moment, an ambulance brings bodies back.
Clean water is rare.”
Residents were seen going to their destroyed homes, picking up soaked property and trying to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5-magnitude quake were overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered from a fractured back and shoulders, rested in front of the Palu military hospital, where patients were being treated outside due to strong lingering aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he recounted how he felt the violent earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I was crushed in the ruins of the wall, I think,” Haris told The Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife calling for help, but after the silence.
I don't know what happened to her or my child.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of “Bullying” Through “Propaganda Ads”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page advertisement touting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade in an American newspaper, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the supplement paid by China Daily in the Des Moines Register — the top-selling newspaper in Iowa — after accusing China of trying to interfere in the Nov. 6 U.S. parliamentary election, a charge that China refutes.
In accusing Beijing of wanting to meddle in the U.S. election, Trump marked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in a growing campaign led by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently paralyzed in a growing trade war that has led them to apply reciprocal tariffs to their imports.
At the start of the trade war, China’s tariff measures were aimed at hitting exporters from states like Iowa that supported Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and longtime former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an op-ed in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, “is doubling down on its intimidation by publishing propaganda in our own free press.”
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the American tradition of freedom of speech and freedom of the press by inserting paid advertising in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“On the other hand, in the Beijing press window, you will find few dissenting voices and will not see the true reflection of the divergent views that the Chinese may have on China’s troubling economic trajectory, as the media firmly obeys the Chinese Communist Party,” he writes.
He added that "one of the most important newspapers in China has avoided publishing" his article, without saying which newspaper.
Analysts warn Republicans are alienating female voters ahead of midterm elections due to Kavanaugh debacle
While many high-ranking Republicans are defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh amid allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that a backlash, especially among women, could arise during the upcoming midterm elections.
The feelings surrounding this case have been extremely strong, and most Republicans have already publicly shown that they want the vote to take place.
In a September 29 article in The Hill, Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, said “you can’t go back.”
Reeher added that he doubted that the last-minute efforts by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) in favor of an FBI investigation were enough to calm voters' anger.
According to Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, “women will not forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it tomorrow, and not in November,” she said on September 28, according to the Washington newspaper.
On Friday morning, Mic reports, protesters chanted “November is coming!” in the Senate corridor as Republicans governing the Judiciary Committee chose to advance Kavanaugh’s nomination despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation is going to be outsized,” said Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst.
“People say it’s already high, it’s true.
But it could be even higher, especially among suburban women voters and young voters between the ages of 18 and 29 who, even if they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public deposition detailing the sexual assault allegations against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts have suggested that the reaction would be likely to be sharp if Republicans moved forward with confirmation.
According to NBC News, former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele said early last week that “It’s become a messy mess for the GOP.”
“It’s not just about the committee vote or the final vote, it’s not just about Kavanaugh’s nomination, it’s also about how the Republicans handled the situation and how they treated it,” said Guy Cecil, director of U.S. Priorities, a group that helps elected Democrats.
Following the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, however, Americans seem divided over the credibility of both sides, with a small majority leaning toward the latter.
A new YouGov poll found that 41% of respondents absolutely or probably believed Ford’s testimony, while 35% said they absolutely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they believed Kavanaugh probably or absolutely lied during his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
According to The Guardian, the FBI is investigating allegations made by Ford and at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, after pressure from Senator Flake.
Ford testified under oath last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was assaulted by Kavanaugh while intoxicated at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that when they were studying at Yale in the 1980s, the Supreme Court nominee allegedly showed him his genitals during a party.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a New Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a brand new company that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The tech legend’s latest project, Inrupt, is a company that leverages Berners-Lee’s free Solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is saved as well as who is allowed to access such and such information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt was aiming to “dominate the world.”
“We have to do it now,” he said of the launch.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own “online personal data store” or DPL.
It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available at the same time on a single browser.
The particularity of the online personal data store is that it is entirely up to the user to decide who can access what type of information.
The company calls this “personal responsibility via data.”
According to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, Inrupt’s idea is that the company brings the right resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a few contract developers working on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not yet in talks with “Facebook and Google” about whether or not to make a complete change where all of their business models are completely disrupted in an instant.
“We’re not asking their permission.”
In an article published Saturday on Medium, Berners-Lee writes that [Inrupt's] "mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem with the goal of protecting the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating the World Wide Web Consortium.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the net neutrality debate.
Although he launched Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m extremely optimistic about this new era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of a clergyman of the First World War decorated with the Victoria Cross
The only Church of England clergyman to receive the Victoria Cross during World War I as a combatant was celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant-Colonel Bernard Vann won this distinction on September 29, 1918, during the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was however killed by a sniper four days later and was unaware that he had obtained the highest British military distinction.
His two grandsons unveiled a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
Michael Vann, one of his grandsons, said it was “brilliantly symbolic” to unveil the stone exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s exploits.
According to the London Gazatte, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion on the Saint-Quentin Canal “through a very thick fog and under the violent firing of field guns and machine guns.”
Later, he rushed to the firing line and, with the "greatest bravery", led the line before blowing up a field gun on his own and knocking out three of the detachment's soldiers.
On October 4, 1918, a German sniper killed Lieutenant Colonel Vann, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “a thing that I will never be up to, but that humbles me.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid down a wreath after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Vann said he felt "very honored to be a part of the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is reflected in the support that will be given to him by many people."
Mixed martial arts fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206. Instead, they got Peppa Pig
Imagine that, you spent the whole night watching a full Bellator 206, but you couldn’t see the main event.
In San José, the event featured 13 fights, including six on the main card, and was broadcast live throughout the night in the United Kingdom, on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready to face off, viewers in the UK were stunned when the broadcast changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were displeased that they remained awake until the early hours of the morning especially for the fight.
One Twitter fan described the move to children’s cartoons as “a kind of bad joke.”
Regarding the broadcast, Bellator senior vice president of marketing and communications Dave Schwartz said that “the government regulation states that at 6 a.m. this content was not suitable, so they had to switch to children’s programming.”
“Peppa the Pig,” he said.
Scott Coker, the president of Bellator, said they would work on their programming to include UK viewers in the future.
“I think when I think about rebroadcasting, I think we can probably come up with a solution,” Coker said.
“However, it’s six o’clock in the morning on a Sunday and we won’t be able to find a solution until Sunday our time, which is Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program switched, there were a lot of messages going both ways and they weren't all friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't a problem, it was a government matter.
I can guarantee you it won't happen next time.
We will limit ourselves to five fights instead of six – as we usually do – and we tried to give more for the fans and we messed it all up.
This is a regrettable situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" in terms of sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley claims he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality – but that instilled in him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize before going to high school that “everyone [was] not like me.”
On the first Radio 4 show Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he talked about the issue of gay rights to give others “hope.”
He also said that becoming a parent made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
The show's regular host, Kirsty Young, took several months off because of her illness.
Appearing as a castaway on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "less than" all the other kids growing up because "it wasn't socially acceptable to love boys and girls."
He said: “Even today, these feelings of being inferior and different are the real things that gave me the power and strength to succeed.”
In order not to disappoint everyone when they finally learned the truth about his sexuality, he wanted to prove that he was “something,” he continued.
The two-time Olympic bronze medallist is now a renowned LGBT activist and took advantage of his participation in this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he was speaking out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without ramifications and wanted to give “hope” back to others.
The three-time world champion said he "didn't expect" to fall in love with a man - US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, met in 2013
Daley last year married the Oscar winner, 20 years his senior, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you see so much at such a young age" - he participated in his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find a person of the same age who had experienced the same ups and downs.
In June, they became parents to a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley claimed that "his whole perspective" had changed.
“If you had asked me last year, I was just thinking about winning a gold medal,” he said.
“You know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked him was if they already had their tickets for London 2012, since he wanted to be seated in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘Dad, you’re not going to be there to be in the front row anymore,’” he said.
“I was holding him by the hand when he stopped breathing and it took for him to stop breathing and die before I finally recognized that he was not invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“It was everything I’d dreamed of all my life – diving in front of a home crowd at the Olympics, there’s nothing better,” he said.
In addition, it inspired his first song choice - Heather Small's Proud - which had accompanied him during the preparations for the Olympics and still gave him the goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15, BST.
Mickelson out of shape on Ryder Cup bench on Saturday
Phil Mickelson of the United States will set a record for his 47th Ryder Cup game on Sunday, but he will have to step up to avoid an unfortunate stage.
Mickelson, who was competing in the biannual competition for the twelfth time, a record, was ruled out by captain Jim Furyk from Saturday’s fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the heart of the action, as he has been so often for the United States, the five-time major champion shared his day between the role of supporting and refining his game at the stand in order to remedy his ailments.
He has never been the greatest leader, even at the peak of his career. At 48, he is not the most suitable for the difficult National Golf, where the long rough systematically punishes the stray shots.
And as if the course wasn’t scary enough in itself, Mickelson, in Sunday’s ninth game, takes on British Open winner Francesco Molinari, who teamed up with Tommy Fleetwood this week to win their four games.
If the Americans, with four downs at the start of the 12 singles games, get off to a good start, Mickelson’s game could prove to be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed his confidence in his man, but he couldn't say much else.
“He fully understood the role he had to play today, gave me a pat on the back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has great confidence in him.
He’s a legendary champion and he’s added so much to these teams in the past, just like this week.
I probably didn’t see him play two games.
I was planning more, but that's how it happened and that's how we felt we had to proceed.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for the most Ryder Cup games played.
It could mark the end of a career at the Ryder Cup that has never quite reached the heights of its individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven losses, although Furyk has said his presence has brought concrete elements to the team.
He’s funny, sarcastic, witty, he likes to make fun of people, and he’s a great guy to have in the team room.”
“I think the younger players had fun competing against him this week, which was fun to watch.
He does a lot more than play.”
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows the lead could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a not insignificant lead before the singles of the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a painful course.
The Dane played his first match in 1997 at Valderrama, where a team captained by Seve Ballesteros was five points ahead of the Americans, but eventually climbed to the top of the standings with the smallest possible gap to the finish line, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You don’t stop remembering that we were leading broadly to Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brookline, where we failed, as well as at Valderrama, where we won, but narrowly,” said Bjorn, after watching the 2018 Rankings win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday at National Golf to lead 10-6.
History will prove to me and to everyone on this team that this is not the end.
Go deep into it tomorrow.
Go ahead and do whatever it takes.
It's not over until we have the points on the board.
We have a goal, to try to win this trophy, and that's what we need to stay focused on.
I’ve always said I’m focused on the 12 players on our side, but we’re very aware of what’s going on on the other side – they’re the best players in the world.”
Delighted with his players’ performances on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never get ahead of myself on this point.
Tomorrow's a whole different set of sleeves.
Tomorrow, individual performances will be presented and everything will be different.
It’s great to be with a teammate when things are going well, but when you’re out there alone, you’re put to the test to your full capacity as a golfer.
That's the message for the players, to get the best out of yourselves tomorrow.
When you leave your partner behind, he has to get the best out of himself, too.”
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will seek to ensure that his players achieve better results individually than as teammates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself experienced both ends of those last-day reversals, having been part of the winning team at Brookline before losing at the end of the "Miracle of Medinah", where Europe snatched the victory.
“I remember every word,” he explains in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had rallied his players on the final day.
“We have 12 important meetings tomorrow, but you’d like to take that quick start like you saw in Brookline, like you saw in Medinah.
This dynamic, when it goes in one direction, puts a lot of pressure on the midfield matches.
We set up our training accordingly and put the guys like we thought we should do it, we’re trying to do magic tomorrow.”
Thomas was given the task of leading the counterattack and will face Rory McIlroy in the first-class duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the top half of the standings.
“I accompanied this group of guys in that order because I think it covers the whole course,” Bjorn said of his singles picks.
Germany's new warship still postponed
According to local media, the new German Navy frigate should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace aging warships dating back to the Cold War, but it will not be in service until at least next year due to faulty systems and exponential spending.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quotes a military spokesman, the commissioning of the “Rheinland-Pfalz”, the flagship of the brand-new Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg frigates, has been postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014, but the worrisome problems that occurred after delivery have jeopardized the fate of this ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class that the Navy ordered in 2007 will replace the aging frigates of the Bremen class.
It is certain that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some stealth technologies, such as a radar, infrared and reduced acoustic signature.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years outside home ports.
According to Die Zeit, however, the incessant delays mean that forward-thinking warships – which should allow Germany to project its force overseas – will already be obsolete when put into service.
Last year, the cursed F125 frigate made headlines when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned a ship to a shipbuilder after its delivery.
The reasons for this return were little known, but the German media mentioned a number of “software and hardware defects” that made the warship useless in case of deployment in combat mission.
The software flaws were particularly significant as the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, which corresponds to half of the crews of the old Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it appears that the vessel is significantly overloaded, which reduces its performance and reduces the Navy's ability to make future improvements.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is estimated to weigh twice as much as the similar-class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Beyond the failures of the computer system, the price of the project as a whole - including the training of the crew - also becomes a problem.
It is said to have reached the astronomical sum of 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion), compared to 2.2 billion initially.
The problems associated with the new frigates are of particular importance in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval strength is dwindling.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament’s defence committee, acknowledged earlier this year that the navy is in fact “short of ships able to deploy”.
The official said the situation had produced a snowball effect over time, as the old ships were downgraded but no replacement ships were designated.
He regretted that none of the frigates of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class were able to join the Navy.
The National Trust monitors the secret life of bats
New research in an area of the Scottish Highlands is looking to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that the observations will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and guide future conservation activities.
The National Trust for Scotland study will follow common bats and sopranos as well as long-eared brown bats and Daubenton at Inverewe Garden, Wester Ross.
Special check-in facilities will be placed at key locations around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
A professional sound analysis will determine the frequency of bat calls as well as the activities of the different species.
A habitat map and report will be developed to provide a detailed picture of their behaviour across the territory.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor for the NTS, hopes the results will reveal the most important areas of habitat for bats and how they are used by each of these species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as grassland development and how best to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, bat populations have declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects perches and causes habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can flypapers and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks from pet cats.
Bats are not really blind.
However, given their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to spot insects and obstacles on their flight path.
Responsible for the protection of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, the NTS takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, perch inspections and sometimes rescues.
The organization also established Scotland's first and only bat reserve at the Threate site in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
David Thompson, the estate’s manager, says the site is the ideal territory for them.
“Here in Threate, we have a great place for bats,” he says.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the right habitat.
But there’s still a lot to learn about bats, so the work we’re doing here and in other places will help us better understand what bats need to thrive.”
He stressed the importance of checking for bats before proceeding with property maintenance, as unintentionally destroying a single maternity nest could result in the deaths of 400 females and young, or even the disappearance of an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, disturb them, or destroy their perches.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish head of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats and as far as many of our species are concerned, we don’t know what’s going on in their populations at the moment.”
Ronaldo denies rape allegations as his lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations against him “false information,” and claimed that people “want to make themselves known” by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus striker was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He then allegedly paid her $375,000 to remain silent about the incident, Der Spiegel said last Friday.
Speaking to his 142 million fans in a video posted live on Instagram hours after the allegations were aired, Ronaldo, 33, called the information “fake news.”
“No, no, no, no, and no.
What they said today is false information,” the five-time Ballon d’Or winner told the camera.
“They want to advertise using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but that's part of the job.
I’m a happy man and everything is fine,” the player added with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they called “an inadmissible denunciation of suspicions in the field of privacy.”
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for “moral damages in an amount commensurate with the gravity of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious human rights violations in recent years.”
The alleged incident reportedly took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms hotel-casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga apparently returned to the player's room, where an anal rape reportedly occurred, according to documents filed with Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga says Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and assured him he was a “99% good guy” but that he didn’t know what was going on with the remaining “1%”.
The documents claim Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also said she went to the police and that photos of her injuries were taken in a hospital, but that she later agreed to an amicable settlement because she felt "terrified by reprisals" and feared "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old says she is now seeking to cancel the settlement, as she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid when he left Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he joined Italian giant Juve on a €100 million contract.
Brexit: The UK would “regret forever” the departure of car manufacturers.
According to Greg Clark, the Secretary of State for Trade, the UK would “regret it forever” if it were to lose its status as the world’s leading automaker after Brexit.
He added that it was “worrying” that Toyota UK told the BBC it would temporarily stop production at its plant in Burnaston, near Derby, if Britain withdrew from the EU without a deal.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis vehicles - built nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90 per cent of which were exported to other European Union countries.
“I believe that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will stop at our plant,” said Marvin Cooke, director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other British carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed fear of leaving the EU without agreement on how cross-border trade will work.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month following Brexit.
The biggest concerns are about what automakers call supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is operated in “stretched flow”, parts arrive every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers for custom-made vehicles.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be disruptions at the border that industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to hold inventory for more than a day at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and so production would be halted.
According to Clark, Theresa May’s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is “precisely calibrated to avoid these border controls.”
"We need an agreement, we want to have the best agreement that will allow, as I said, not only to take advantage of the current success, but also to seize this opportunity," he said on the BBC's Radio 4's Today.
“The evidence, not only from Toyota but from other manufacturers, is that we absolutely must be able to maintain what has proven to be an excellent set of supply chains.”
While Toyota was unable to specify how long production would be stopped, it did warn that in the longer term, the additional costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, the Unite union coordinator at the plant who has worked for 24 years in Burnaston, said its members were increasingly concerned: “In my experience, once these jobs disappear, they never come back.”
A government spokesman said: "We have put forward a clear and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
White House says Trump and Rosenstein meeting could be delayed
According to the White House announcement on Sunday, the high-stakes meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed by a week,” while the fight for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller, the special counsel charged with investigating Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump aides and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The question of whether or not Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, and thus endanger Mueller’s independence, has been fueling rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had talked about wearing a microphone in order to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president by the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied these claims.
However, last Monday, he showed up at the White House, just as he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would “prefer not” to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, testified.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the complaints against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate vote.
On Sunday, Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, made an appearance on Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “No date has been set for that, it could be this week, I could see if we push back another week given all the other things that are going on in the Supreme Court.
But we will see and I like to keep the press informed.”
The claim would be disputed by some journalists: Since September 10, Sanders has not held any press conference at the White House.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders responded that the rarity of the lectures was not due to an aversion to "demagogic" television reporters, though she said, "I have nothing against them wowing the gallery."
Then she hinted that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
Without citing evidence, she added that “the president participates in more question-and-answer sessions than any president before him”: “We checked the numbers.”
There will always be press conferences, Sanders said, but “if the press has the chance to directly question the president of the United States, it’s infinitely better than talking to me.
We’re trying to do that frequently, as you’ve seen over the last few weeks, and it’s going to take the place of a press conference where you can talk to the president of the United States.”
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends public meetings or press conferences with dignitaries.
It is rare for him to give solo press conferences there.
This week, in New York, the president may have shown why, by making a casual and at times bizarre appearance in front of the assembled journalists.
On Brexit fears, Health Secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland
The Health Secretary has written to EU officials working within the Scottish NHS to express the country’s gratitude and wish them to remain in post after Brexit.
Scottish MP Jeane Freeman sent a letter within less than six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to covering the cost of status applications for European citizens working in its decentralised public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: “During the summer, negotiations on the withdrawal continued between the UK and the EU and are expected to result in decisions this autumn.
But the British government has also stepped up its preparations in the event of a no-deal scenario.
I understand that this period must be very troubling for each of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate how much I value the contribution of every staff member, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we really want you to stay here.”
After sustaining a head injury, Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery
Tennessee State’s Sselon Mike Organ and Tennessee Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie had emergency surgery after a head injury Saturday in a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores.
Rod Reed, the head coach of the state of Tennessee, told reporters that the injury occurred just before halftime.
“He got on the touchline and collapsed there,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the sideline before placing him on a stretcher and taking him for another exam.
A Tennessee state representative told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of the operating room at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris said there was "no word yet on the type or extent of the injury" and that the state of Tennessee was trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a sophomore, is in his first season with the state of Tennessee after moving from Illinois.
He had five tackles in total Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his season total to 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp duty if they buy property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty if they buy property in the UK and the extra money will be used to help the homeless under the new Conservative regimes.
This measure will cancel the success of the campaign led by Corbyn to attract young voters
Stamp duty increase to be imposed on those who do not pay tax in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp duty rate if they buy a property in the UK – the extra money will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
This measure will be seen as an initiative to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters by committing to providing more affordable housing and targeting high-income earners.
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the additional money will be used to bolster the government’s efforts in the fight to help the homeless.
This surcharge - in addition to the current stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second homes and rental purchases - could reach 3%.
The Treasury expects the project to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
Around 13 per cent of London’s new construction is bought by non-UK residents, driving up prices and preventing first-time buyers from gaining a foothold in the housing market.
Many affluent areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost towns" because of the high number of foreign buyers who mostly stay outside the country.
This new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a reduction in the stamp duty in order to help more young people acquire a first home.
Accusing major construction companies of keeping real estate prices high by grabbing land without using it, he called on Mrs May to give up quotas on affordable housing in an effort to address the “real estate disgrace” that is plaguing the UK.
Mr Corbyn presented an attractive set of proposals for reform in the housing sector, including rent control and the elimination of evictions “without fault”.
It also wants to give councils more extensive powers to build new housing.
Mrs May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my post as Prime Minister to the rebirth of the British dream – that every new generation would have a better life.
To do this, we need to fix our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and build a life here.
It is unfair, however, that it is as easy for non-UK residents, as well as foreign companies, to buy a home as it is for hard-working UK residents.
For far too many people, the dream of homeownership has become remote and the misery of the homeless remains too real.”
Jack Ross: My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland.
Sunderland coach Jack Ross says his “ultimate ambition” is to become Scotland’s coach at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot is pleased to take up the challenge of reviving the North East club, which currently occupies third place in Ligue 1, three points behind the leader.
He joined the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I was selected for Division B and that's it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportssound.
“But I grew up watching Scotland at Hampden with my father and that’s something I’ve never forgotten.
This opportunity would only present itself, however, if I succeed in the management of the club.”
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland managers were Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager says he has not hesitated to line up behind such iconic names in such a large club, having already declined the proposals of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“For me, the success of the moment will be measured in the light of the question ‘can I bring this club back to the Premier League?’
Due to the structure and infrastructure of this club, it undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League,” he added.
“It’s not easy to get there, but I would probably consider myself a success here only if I manage to bring the club back there.”
Ross has only a three-year coaching career, after a stint as an assistant coach at Dumbarton and 15 months with Hearts.
He then helped Alloa up from a relegation to the third division and turned St Mirren, who was on the verge of relegation, into a major championship winner the following season.
Ross says he is more comfortable now than during his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
The taking over of Alloa “was probably a real crossroads,” he recalls.
“I really thought being a coach was better than playing.
It seems strange because I did well, made a good living and enjoyed some appreciable heights.
But sometimes playing is difficult.
There are a lot of details to be worked out each week.
I continue to experience this in terms of stress and tension at work, but being a coach is great for me.
I’ve always wanted to lead and now I do, I feel more comfortable in my own skin than I have in my entire adult life.”

According to a survey, the ideal time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday.
The heatwave of the summer has raised revenues for struggling British pubs, but has added to the pressure on restaurant chains.
The figures indicate that bar and pub groups recorded a 2.7% increase in sales in July, but revenues in restaurants fell by 4.8.
Peter Martin of consulting firm CGA, which compiled the data, said: “England’s continued sunshine and longer-than-expected participation in the World Cup meant that July followed the June model, with bars up 2.8 per cent, except for restaurants, which suffered an even bigger shock.
The 1.8% drop in the restaurant sector in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars serving alcoholic beverages are by far the most popular, with more points of similarity than restaurants that drop.
Food pubs have also suffered from the effects of the sun, but not as much as restaurateurs.
It seems that people just want to go out for a drink.
In pubs and bars, beverage sales increased by 6.6% over the month and food decreased by 3%.
Paul Newman, leisure and hospitality analyst at RSM, said: “These results follow the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-home market.
No wonder foodservice groups continue to struggle, though a 4.8% year-on-year average drop in sales is particularly painful, in addition to continued cost pressures.
The long, hot summer could not have been less opportune for food business operators and the weather will tell us whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will grant a well-deserved reprieve.”
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in location.
Industry sales are monitored by the Coffer Peach Tracker for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector, which collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion and is the standard in the established industry.
On social media, one in five children has secret accounts that they hide from their parents
According to a survey, one in five children – some as young as 11 – has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students found an increase in “fake Insta” pages
The news has heightened concerns about the publication of sexual content
20% of students said they had a “primary” account to show their parents
One in five children – some as young as 11 – opens a social media account that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students found a rapid growth of “fake Insta accounts” — a reference to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has heightened concerns about the publication of sexual content.
20% of students reported managing a “main” account cleaned up to show their parents, while still having a private account.
A mother who stumbled upon her 13-year-old daughter’s secret website discovered a teenager who incited others to “rape me.”
According to the study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, 40% of young people aged 11 to 18 have a double profile, with half of students acknowledging having private accounts.
CSM Chief Mike Buchanan said, “It’s concerning that so many teens are tempted to create online places where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will represent the athletes on the Scottish Athletics Board of Directors.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Board of Directors as a non-executive director at the governing body’s annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland’s most decorated athlete in track and field and President Ian Beattie described this as a great opportunity for the sport’s leaders to build on his extensive experience gained internationally over the past decade.
“Eilidh enjoys immense respect within the Scottish, British and global athletics community and we are confident that athletics in Scotland would benefit tremendously from her participation on the council,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I really want to be the voice of the athletes and I really want to be able to contribute and guide the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the 1996 200-metre and 400-metre events at the Atlanta Olympics where he won four gold medals and is now a regular commentator for the BBC, was unable to walk after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors claimed that only time would tell if I would recover or how much.
It was a trying job, but I recovered completely, I learned to walk again and today I do agility exercises!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!”
Online breast pump ad that compares mothers and cows divides opinions
An online ad from a company offering a breast pump compares nursing mothers to cows when milking.
To mark the launch of what’s being called the world’s first silent breast pump, Elvie, a consumer technology company, launched a bold music video-inspired ad to show off the freedom its new breast pump offers breastfeeding women.
In a cow barn filled with hay, four real mothers dance to a song whose lyrics are: “Yes, I’m milking myself, but you don’t see a tail” and “In case you haven’t noticed, it’s my breasts, not udders.”
The chorus continues: “Pump it, pump it, I feed the babies, pump it, pump it, pump it, I help the women milking.”
However, the ad, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, sparked an online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from the public, many of whom say it sheds light on the “horrors” of the dairy industry.
“A poor decision than to use cows to promote this product.
Just like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are taken from them in the days following their birth,” one of them wrote.

Another commented: “It’s an understandable trauma for the mother and the baby.
But yeah, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are babysitting?
Someone else added, “An advertisement so disconnected.”
Others defended the ad, for example a woman admitting that she found the song "hilarious."
“I think it’s a genius idea.
I would have bought one if I was still breastfeeding.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
It's a great product," someone wrote.
Someone else commented, “It’s a fun ad for moms who pump their milk (often at work or in the bathroom) and feel like “cows.”
It’s not an advertisement that praises the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the women reveal that they danced with the discreet breast pumps hidden in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the idea that many women who use the breast pump say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie breast pump is completely silent, without wires or pipes and discreetly fits into a nursing bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their baby and even go out while drawing their milk.
Ana Balarin, Partner and DPE at Mother commented: “The Elvie breast pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between nursing mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to emphasize the extraction of breast milk and all its challenges, while expressing in a fun and reliable way the incredible sense of freedom that this new breast pump will provide.
This is not the first time that the breast pump Elvie has made the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the catwalk of designer Marta Jakubowski while she was using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children have quietly settled in a camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has risen sharply although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively stable, in part because the Trump administration’s harsh rhetoric and policies have made it more difficult for respondents to place children.
Traditionally, most of the respondents were undocumented immigrants themselves, and they were afraid of compromising their own ability to stay in the country by bringing a child to the rescue.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential respondents and adult members of their household should submit their fingerprints and that this data would be passed on to immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs official, testified last week before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have a criminal record.
“Nearly 80 per cent of respondents or their family members are here illegally, and many of them are foreign criminals.
Therefore, we continue to prosecute these people,” Albence said.
According to the shelters' stakeholders, in order to deal with the case of children more quickly, the authorities have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of their detention, rather than after 60 days, which was the norm before.
Many will appear via videoconference, rather than in person, to plead their case with respect to their legal status before an immigration judge.
Those deemed ineligible will be promptly expelled.
According to stakeholders and reports presented in recent months by the shelter network, the longer children remain in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to outbreaks of violence or attempts to flee.
In a large institution like Tornillo, these concerns are exacerbated by the fact that signs that a child is in trouble are more likely to be overlooked because of their size, according to child rights advocates.
They added that moving children to the camp without giving them time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to their friends could accentuate a trauma that many are struggling to cope with.
Syria calls on the US, French and Turkish “occupation forces” to withdraw immediately.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in that country is now in its eighth year.
Mualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they “would be treated accordingly.”
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Mualem argued that the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, as more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been uprooted from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue “to wage this sacred battle until all Syrian territories are purged” from both terrorist groups and any “illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, most of whom train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
In this war-torn country, France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground.
Moualem said of the refugees, that conditions were favourable for their return, and accused “some Western countries” of “spreading irrational concerns” that deterred refugees from returning.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to ensure that these returns are facilitated,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have said that there will be no support for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in Idlib's last rebel stronghold has helped advance political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a full-scale assault on the province where three million people live, by Russian-backed Syrian forces.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement provided for “specific deadlines” and expressed the hope that the military measures will target jihadists, especially Nusra Front fighters, who are linked to Al-Qaeda and who “will be eliminated.”
Staffan de Mistura, a United Nations representative, hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee bringing together members of the government and the opposition to draft a post-war constitution and pave the way for elections in Syria.
Mualem defined the conditions for the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, saying the group’s work should be limited to “revising the articles of the current constitution,” and issued a warning against any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Mr. Trump would be re-elected in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers undoubtedly hope, impeachment and scandal lead him to leave his presidency prematurely.
This would probably be “The most spectacular finale of a presidency!”
At the moment, the public shows no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, peak hour ratings have more than doubled, reaching 1.05 million on CNN, and have virtually tripled, to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC’s “Rachel Maddow Show,” which reaches 3.5 million viewers at big parties, is the No. 1 cable TV network.
“It’s a case that attracts people because it’s not something we understand,” said Neal Baer, host of the ABC drama series “Designated Survivor,” about a minister who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedian and author of Just the Funny Parts: And Some Irrefutable Truths About Sliding Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has another theory.
She remembers taking a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked him.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” Ms. Scovell told me.
Chaos has a playful value.
Obviously, unlike anything on television, Washington’s scenarios could determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, whether immigrant families can come together and the health of the global economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the wealthiest viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond being an informed citizen when you find yourself staring for six hours at a panel of experts debating how Bob Woodward used “profound know-how” for his book “Fear,” about Paul Manafort’s 15,000-dollar ostrich-leather jacket (“a garment filled with pride,” according to the Washington Post) and the consequences of Trump’s actions.
I will never see Super Mario in the same way again.
“If part of what he does feels like watching a reality show, it’s because he makes you swallow something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars,” about Trump’s changing teams and daily turnarounds (fighting with the NFL, congratulating Kim Jong-un).
We can't afford to miss an episode otherwise we're lagging behind.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, it was 26 degrees at home on the north shore of Kauai, but he was hiding inside to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn’t break away, not with Brett Kavanaugh preparing to take on the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
"I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right.”

Foreign Money Invades Tightest Midterm Elections
Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania’s 17th district is inundated with cash, thanks to a readjustment of congressional districts that allowed two incumbents to compete for the same seat.
This recently restructured suburban district of Pittsburgh is the seat of Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another riding in the special election last spring.
Lamb competes with another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th District of Pennsylvania, which strongly straddles the new 17th District.
The maps were redrawn when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the former boroughs were unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of the Republicans.
The race for the new 17th district kicked off a showdown over campaign finance between the major party-funding branches, the Congressional Committee for the Democratic Campaign (CCCD) and the Republican National Campaign Committee (CNCR).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a narrowly won victory last March in a highly popular special election in the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
That seat had been held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political scientists have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The U.S. considered penalizing El Salvador for its support for China, then backed down
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, which Washington was little opposed to.
Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners ousted the Trump Organization’s leadership.
State Department officials have decided to convene the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama to protest “their recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But sanctions have only been imposed on El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including to control narcotics and provide development and economic support.
The envisaged sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high rates of unemployment and homicide.
As internal meetings continued, representatives from North and Central America delayed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity to follow up on a similar meeting last year, seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from travelling to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, thus ending any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence now has to speak at the conference, scheduled for mid-October, to show the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three U.S. emissaries quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without further messages or harsh punishment from Washington.
A spokesman for Bolton at the White House declined to comment on details of the debate that were described by the three U.S. dignitaries, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations on condition of anonymity.
Their comments were corroborated by an independent analyst close to the administration, who also remained anonymous.
Studying history
The next tile could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on the possible obstruction of justice for Mr. Trump. The public record is now supported by substantial evidence.
Mr. Mueller would also direct his investigation to the question of whether Mr. Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia in its attack on our election.
If control of Congress changes, Trump will be held accountable to Congress as he prepares to stand before voters and, perhaps, a jury of his peers.
These are many “ifs,” and I do not claim that Mr. Trump’s downfall is inevitable — nor that of his counterparts in Europe.
We all have decisions to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the potential duration of this struggle.
In 1938, German officers were about to stage a coup against Hitler, if only the West had stood up to him and pushed the Czechoslovaks back to Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around these cleavages and the inescapable march of democracy is speeding up or being delayed.
Americans are currently facing a number of these divides.
What will we do if Mr. Trump returns Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has found himself in a delicate situation since the paper reported that last year he proposed to secretly record the president and made assumptions about his unfitness for office.
Rosenstein says the Times report is inaccurate.
“What will we say if the FBI’s recently requested investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not exhaustive or impartial — or if it is confided to the Supreme Court despite sexual assault allegations and dishonest testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump to account?
If we do not pass these tests, democracy will spend a long winter.
But I am convinced that we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jewess deported to Auschwitz under the Nazi regime, who once occupied my residence as ambassador.
She survived, immigrated to America and, sixty years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles on the swastika table.
With this legacy, I can’t help but be optimistic about our future.”

Rangers' Graham Dorrans confident against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the win over the Austrians, following the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G in the Europa League.
A knee injury deprived midfielder Graham Dorrans of his first appearance of the season until the 2:2 draw against Villarreal, but he is convinced that the Rangers are able to make the most of such a result to achieve feats.
“It was a positive for us because Villarreal is a quality team,” said the 31-year-old striker.
“We went into the game thinking we were going to get something and we came away with one point.
We might have won in the end, but overall a draw was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we came back in the second half and we were the better team.
Thursday is another important European evening.
With a bit of luck we can hope to get three points, but it will be a difficult match as they made a good result in their last match, nevertheless I am sure we can continue and get a positive result with the crowd behind us.
“Last year was really difficult, between my injuries and the changes made to the club as such, but there is a satisfaction factor about this place now.
The team is good and the guys have a lot of fun; the training is quality.
Hopefully we can move forward now, leave last season behind us and win.”
Women no longer find sleep because of this fear about their retirement savings
Although the survey participants clearly knew how they wanted to be cared for, few people raised the issue with their family members.
Almost half of the people who participated in the national study said they talked with their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had told their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they’re not doing what’s necessary to have that conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance business.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family for care if you don’t tell them your wishes well in advance.
Work with your counsellor and family to determine where and how you can receive care, as these options can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Call your financial advisor: Your financial advisor can also help you determine how to pay these fees.
Your long-term care financing decisions can include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash-value hybrid life insurance policy to help you cover those expenses, or other insurance on your wealth – as long as you have the means to insure it.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal battles along the way.
Provide a health care power of attorney that will allow you to designate a trusted person who will verify your medical care and ensure that professionals respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also consider a power of attorney regarding your financial resources.
You would choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid if you are incapacitated.
Think about the small details: Suppose your elderly parent has a medical emergency and goes to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
List these details in a written document to be well prepared.
“It’s not just finances that are at stake, but who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
“What are the medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
Put that plan in place.”
A man was wounded several times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle as he walked home from a party.
The victim, in his forties, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Police described the incident, which occurred at approximately 2:30 a.m. BST, as a "random act."
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries did not threaten his life and the police issued a call for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said, and the toll is expected to rise.
With communications stalled, emergency services were unable to receive any information from the Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude quake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated as a result of the disaster.
Some essential facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the tip of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, whose population was estimated at 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency that runs along more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The population of the regency, an administrative region located below a province, was estimated at 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of Central Sulawesi province, particularly in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also an important activity in the province, but it is mainly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past century, according to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck west of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Seismic Fire and is regularly shaken by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on December 26 off the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province triggered a tsunami that swept 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: Several violent earthquakes rocked the west coast of Sumatra from late March to early April.
A few hundred people died on the island of Nias off Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia’s most populated island, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast and claimed nearly 700 lives.
2009: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 shook the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people have been killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake devastated one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, triggering a 10-meter tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake shook the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, reminding residents of the devastation wrought by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but more than 100 people were killed by the collapse of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes rocked the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The quake destroyed several thousand buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, violating a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to a statement released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, he took the phone of a female acquaintance who was trying to call the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is being held in pre-trial detention in the Mat-Su pre-trial detention centre and is being held on $500 unsecured bond, KTUU said.
He appeared in court on Saturday, pleading "not guilty, that's for sure" when his plea was asked, the network said.
Palin faces three Class A offences, meaning he could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a Class B minor offence, punishable by one day's imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, contacted police to report the alleged assault.
The case is pending before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with spousal violence, interference in the reporting of a crime of spousal violence, and possession of a weapon while drunk in connection with the incident.
His wife claimed he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she linked her son’s violent behavior to PTSD stemming from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake in Indonesia: several hundred dead
At least 384 people have died as a result of the earthquake that shook the Indonesian island of Sulawesi last Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and devastated thousands of homes.
Electricity and telecommunications networks are down and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck just off central Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
Videos posted on social media show the point of impact.
Several hundred people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu as the tsunami raged on the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death penalty for person suspected of terrorist attack in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the alleged New York assailant who claimed eight victims — a rare sentence that has not been carried out in this state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rented truck from the Home Depot to attack a bike path on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, cutting his way through pedestrians and a cyclist last October.
In order to justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally” murdered the eight victims and “intentionally” inflicted serious bodily harm, according to the statement of intent to seek the death penalty filed with the Southern District of New York.
Both charges are likely to carry the death penalty, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the assault, a federal grand jury convicted Saipov on 22 charges, including eight counts of murder for extortion, commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases and one for the crimes of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “careful preparation and premeditation,” prosecutors said, calling Saipov’s method “odious, cruel and depraved.”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco,” the statement said.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
The Southern District of New York had not sought the death penalty in a lawsuit in 10 years.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers but was subsequently sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a New York federal case was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed for engaging in acts of conspiracy and espionage for the USSR in the two years following the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, demonstrated an absence of remorse in the days and months following the tragedy, according to court documents.
According to police, he told investigators that he was happy with his actions.
Saipov told authorities that he was incited to carry out the attack after watching videos of Daesh on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to display the Daesh flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to all 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was “obviously disappointed” by the decision to prosecute.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept his guilty plea and sentence him to life imprisonment without the possibility of release can only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all concerned,” Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MP says Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today to “mobilize the people’s army” during a demonstration at the Conservatives conference.
The former UK Independence Party leader said politicians should "feel the pressure" from eurosceptics - as one of Theresa May's MPs suggested, he should be tasked with negotiating with the EU.
Conservative backbench MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham march that the UK “would have been liberated already” if Mr Farage had been Brexit secretary.
But the dilemma Mrs May faces in reconciling her deeply divided troops has been highlighted by Conservatives in favour of staying in the Union who have joined an isolated protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to maintain his Chequers compromise plan despite threats from those who want to leave and those who want to stay as well as from the EU.
The allies stressed that it would continue its attempts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the hostilities - and would force eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its programme and "chaos".
Bone told the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to "get rid of Chequers."
He felt that Mr Farage should have become a partner and been entrusted with the task of negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had been in charge, we would have been out by now,” he said.
The MP for Wellingborough added: “I will defend Brexit, but we need to get rid of Chequers.”
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he continued: “We did not engage in world wars to submit.
We want to make our own laws in our own homeland.”
Mr Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people have turned the page and want to stay is completely wrong.”
Conservative Andrea Jenkyns, who was in favour of leaving, was also present at the march to tell reporters: “I’m just saying: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is not appreciated by the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is also the case of our party and our activists who roam the streets and make us elect above all.
Give up Chequers and start listening.”
In a message to Mrs May, she added: “Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Farage told the rally that politicians should be made to "feel the pressure" if they were about to betray the decision that was made in the 2016 referendum.
“This is now a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
They are trying to cheat Brexit and we are saying to them today: ‘We will not let you get away with this’.
He added in a message to the enthusiastic crowd: “I wish you would put pressure on our political class that is about to betray Brexit.
We are mobilising the people’s army of this country that has enabled us to win the Brexit and we will not stop until we have become an independent, self-reliant and proud UK.”
Meanwhile, pro-European supporters marched through Birmingham before staging a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small number of activists waved Conservative anti-Brexit banners after the group’s launch this weekend.
His Labour counterpart Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives over the security issues surrounding the party's application at the start of the conference.
“They are the ones who assure us that they are able to set up the computer systems and all the technology for Canada, plus, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“This is a real farce.
A good Brexit doesn’t exist,” he added.
Warren intends to seriously consider running in the presidential election
On Saturday, Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will seriously consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat discussed her future Saturday at a town hall in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a voice often critical of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, the GOP representative to the states, who was co-chair in 2016 for the Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
She found herself at the center of speculation that she could face Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon’s event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters as part of a town hall meeting since Trump took office.
One participant asked her if she intended to run for president.
Warren responded that the time had come “for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, which involves having a woman head of state.”
Louisiana State University Sims Arrested in Shooting Death
On Saturday, police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said a suspect had been arrested in connection with the shooting death of basketball player Wayde Sims, an LSU basketball player, on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department participated in the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11:00 a.m.
On Friday, they posted a video of the shooting, asking for help identifying a man who appeared in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot dead Friday morning near the Southern University campus.
“Wayde Sims received a gunshot wound to the head and succumbed to his injuries,” Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told 247 sports on Saturday.
Wayde defended his friend and was shot by Simpson.
When questioned, Simpson admitted to being at the scene, in possession of a weapon, and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 2m youngster who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games, including 10 as a starter last season, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton heads to world title after team guidelines helped him win victory over Sebastian Vettel
It quickly became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton last Saturday that the Mercedes team's instructions would play an important role in the competition.
From pole position, Bottas got off to a good start and brushed Hamilton on the flank as he defended his place in the first two laps, and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel entered the pits first and left Hamilton to ride into the turmoil at the tail of the peloton, which should have been a deciding factor.
The Mercedes went through the pits a lap later and ended up behind Vettel, but Hamilton took the lead after a wheel-to-wheel action that saw the Ferrari driver reluctantly leave the inside at the risk of resisting after a double defence attempt in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the last row of the grid and was seventh at the end of the very first lap to celebrate his 21st birthday.
He then dominated much of the race while maintaining his tyres to aim for a speed finish and overtake Kimi Raikkonen in fourth place.
He eventually made it to the pits on lap 44, but was unable to pick up the pace in the remaining eight laps, with Raikkonen ranking fourth.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri has done a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman who let me pass.
The team did an exceptional job to get a one-two,” Hamilton said.
It was very bad body language.
At a meeting last Saturday, President Donald Trump taunted Senator Dianne Feinstein, who pointed out that she had not disclosed the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but he argued that events in the Senate showed people to be "nasty, disgusting and dishonest."
“The only thing that could happen is the beautiful thing that’s been happening these last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and disgusting and dishonest,” he said.
“Seeing the disclosures and leaks, they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you release any information?
Do you remember his answer... did you divulge any information - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, no, no.
I did not disclose anything."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we divulge information... No, we did not divulge information,” he added, thinking of the senator’s impression.
Feinstein received last July from Ford the letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh, and the disclosure took place in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
“I didn’t cover up Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t divulge his story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She told me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential like she asked me to.”
But his denial does not seem to be well received by the president, who commented Saturday night at the rally: "I'll tell you, it was very bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but it’s the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, accused of sexual assault by three women, the president hinted that Democrats were using these allegations for their own ends.
“They are determined to regain power by all means.
You see the meanness, the pettiness, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to crush to get power and control,” the president told Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars erased Friday's Elite League loss to the Belfast Giants in a 5-3 rematch at Dundee last Saturday.
The Giants opened the scoring with two goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home the tie before Dwyer gave the Giants back the lead.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bouchard equalized for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen scored two goals, assuring them of victory.
It was the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe's players, who beat Dundee 2-1 on Friday night in Belfast after being caught.
It was the fourth game of the season between the two sides, with the Giants having won the last three games.
Dwyer gave the lead in the fourth minute, at 3:35, thanks to a pass from Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford served Beauvillier who doubled the bet four minutes later.
In a busy first period, Sullivan re-started the home team at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt put himself in Cownie's service, at 15:16, with a tie.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead before the first half when he hit his second goal of the night toward the end of the first period.
The home team rallied and Bouchard once again equalized with a goal giving a power-play advantage at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran collaborated to help Nielsen put Dundee in the lead for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, securing victory for his team by scoring a fifth goal midway.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will host Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller died helping hundreds of people aboard an aircraft escape the quake.
An Indonesian air traffic controller is hailed as a hero after he died ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people can take off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many more are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi last Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to ravage the area and a large number of people are trapped under rubble in the city of Palu.
But despite the flight of his colleagues, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to abandon his post in the violently shaken tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He remained on site to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he felt it collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said the action may have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian ABC News.
We mobilized a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“Our hearts are broken to learn this,” he added.
Authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, with the country's disaster prevention agency saying access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The toll would continue to increase as many bodies were still under the rubble and many could not be rescued," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves measuring up to six meters have ravaged Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute, an ambulance brings back bodies.
Clean water is rare.
Mini-markets are looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is running to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they’re going to find.
It’s already a tragedy, but it could get worse.”
Joko Widodo, the Indonesian president, arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country’s military: “I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?” said CNN.
Indonesia was rocked earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now claims a man went missing after a plane crashed in the lagoon.
The airline that handled the flight that crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says one man is missing, after the 47 passengers and crew safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon, it was not able to trace a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to more specific requests for information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Authorities said Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline said on Saturday that six passengers were still in hospital, and all were in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact course of events remain uncertain.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon near the airstrip.
Witnesses said the plane had passed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had arrived too low.
“It’s a very good thing,” Jaynes says.
Jaynes said he and the others were able to slip into the water as far as the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He claimed that the flight attendants had panicked and shouted, and that he was suffering from a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors who were working nearby to upgrade a dock also participated in the rescue by using a rubber boat to transport people to land before the plane sank in about 100 feet (30 meters) of water.
Air Safety Network data indicate that 111 people have died in airline accidents recorded in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none involved Air Niugini.
The analyst presents the chronology of the night when the woman was burned alive
The prosecution adjourned its case Saturday at the trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
US Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used cell phone records to track the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
Rowlett said he obtained location data from several cellphones that indicated Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, which contradicted his previous statements, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers' when he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford appeared at the bar on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford replied that he was "[lying] because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency is that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Phone records show they've known each other for a week.
Rowlett claimed that sometime after Chambers’ death, Tellis deleted the SMS, calls and Chambers’ contact information from his phone.
“He erased her from her life,” Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin pleadings on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to take place in front of the jury later in the day.
The High Breed: What is political hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the genre’s negative vision by imbuing their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip hop has moved away from its origins of political messages and social problems.
The group wants to reconnect with its roots and make political hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
New York nanny sues couple for firing her after 'racist' text
A New York nanny is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving an erroneous message from the mother who complained that she was “still a Black.”
The couple denies being racist, and equates the prosecution with “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed dismay when she found out in 2016 that Giselle Maurice, the new nanny, was Black when she arrived for her first day of work.
“NOOOOOOOOOOON ANOTHER BLACK,” Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in an SMS.
Yet, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Mrs. Maurice.
According to the New York Post, after understanding her blunder, “uncomfortable,” Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Maurice, explaining that their former nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that she was expecting a Filipino instead.
Ms. Maurice was paid for a day’s work, then sent home by an Uber.
Now, Mauritius is suing the couple for compensation for her dismissal and is seeking compensation of $350 per day for the six-month home service for which she was originally hired, but without a contract.
“I want to make them understand, listen, we don’t do this kind of thing,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple responded to the allegations of racism by saying it was reasonable to terminate Maurice's employment, fearing that they would not be able to trust him after having harmed him.
“My wife had sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racists,” Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you entrust your children to a person with whom you have been rude, even if it was by mistake?
Your new baby?
Let's see!"
Calling the trial an “extortion”, Plasco said his wife was only two months away from having a baby and was in a “very delicate situation”.
“Would you pursue someone like that?
It’s not a very pleasant thing to do,” added the investment banker.
While the case is still ongoing, the court of public opinion did not hesitate to denounce the couple on social media, blaming them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers feared readers might not identify with a talking bear, new letter reveals
Karen Jankel, Bond’s daughter, born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone reading it for the first time before it’s published.
It’s a lot of fun, knowing what we know about Paddington’s huge success.”
She said her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before writing the children's book inspired by a small teddy bear, would have remained optimistic about the rejection of his work. She added that the 60th anniversary of the books' publication had a "sweet-bitter" flavor after his death last year.
She described Paddington as a "very important member of our family", and added that her father was very proud of his ultimate success.
“He was a fairly calm man, and he wasn’t pretentious,” she said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who does something: you’re proud of him, even if it’s not really his own achievement.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although it is his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he has always attributed the credit to Paddington himself.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
When she landed, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried everything to save her life.
“Nad called regularly to explain how bad the situation was, we didn’t expect her to get out of it,” Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then Nad called me to let me know that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications doctors had given him to maintain his heart rate were slowly running out and getting out of his system.
She had died some time before and it all stopped.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that this was all going on.
I couldn't scream or scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold on.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, in mourning for her daughter, got on the plane with the other passengers, without worrying about the ordeal she was going through.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
“My head was down, and I was crying all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt this immense sympathy for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Mourning women drop postcards to prevent suicides on bridges.
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide strive to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys posted postcards on a Welsh bridge containing inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Ms. Davis’ son, Tyler, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and committed suicide at 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel what I’m forced to feel on a daily basis,” she said.
Ms Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said his smile lit up any room.”
However, he quit his job before he died, as he was “in a very dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s 11-year-old brother was reunited with his brother after he committed suicide.
Ms. Davis said, "I'm constantly afraid there's a ripple effect."
Davis created the maps “to let people know that there are people you can go and see and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t be silent – you need to talk.”
Ms. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Ms. Davis, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, shortly after her mother’s death.
“He didn’t say he felt down, depressed or anything,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we saw his attitude change.
He was at his lowest on Christmas Day – when the kids opened their presents, he didn’t have eye contact with them or anything.”
She said her death was a huge trauma for them, but they have to get through it: “It’s heartbreaking for the family.
It destroys us.
But we all have to go ahead and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation.
“I thought if we could get something like what he was asking for — a time-limited investigation, limited in its scope — maybe we could bring some unity,” Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would “collapse” into a partisan deadlock.
Why didn’t Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due to the choice of the moment.
The midterm elections will be held in just five weeks, on November 6, and if, as expected, the Republicans score poorly, they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call senators, asking them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and met, through him, his wife Ashley, who was at the time his personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI submits its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently seats 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
We do not yet know whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to decide on the vote and confirm it before the Supreme Court.
North Korea: Number of defectors ‘falls’ under Kim’s leadership
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Southern Unification Ministry, said 1,127 desertions had taken place last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Park said tightening border controls between North Korea and China and raising tariffs demanded by smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang has made no public comment.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors will ultimately be granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing through China, which shares the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), located between the two Koreas.
China views deserters as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South - which are technically still at war - have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on denuclearization negotiations that had been pending until then.
This came after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they agreed, broadly speaking, to work towards a denuclearized Korean Peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
“In the absence of confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in such circumstances, it is excluded that we are the first to engage in unilateral disarmament,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi Calls Brett Kavanaugh “Hysterical,” Says He’s Unfit to Serve on Supreme Court
Pelosi, leader of the parliamentary minority, called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and said he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn't help but think that if a woman had behaved this way, they would have called her "hysterical," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last Thursday.
Kavanaugh has emotionally denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional and sometimes almost screamed and choked when talking about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations about him a “grotesque and coordinated assassination” organized by liberals disappointed that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh’s testimony showed he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court, since it showed he was against the Democrats.
“I think he’s discrediting himself with these statements and the way he’s been targeting the Clintons and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if Democrats would get a majority in the House of Representatives.
“If he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he’s not only unfit to sit on the Supreme Court, but he’s also unfit to sit on the court where he currently sits,” Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh is a judge at the DC Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi also added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh’s possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, since he is considered a conservative judge.
During his confirmation of charges hearings, Mr. Kavanaugh evaded the question of the possible reversal of certain Supreme Court decisions.
“This is not the time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, ‘Isn’t this wonderful,’” Pelosi said.
And women have to use it.
It is a legitimate diatribe, months and years of anger that overflow, and she cannot get it out without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s rare, do you?”
“I was greatly helped by a woman who was an executive somewhere, who told me that she also cried when she got angry, but she developed a technique that allowed her to tell the person she was talking to, when she got angry and cried, ‘You can think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I am angry.”
And then she continued.
And I found it brilliant.”
Tears are allowed as an outlet for anger, in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories of a first job, in a male-dominated office, where I found myself crying with inexpressible rage, was being grabbed by the skin of my neck by an elderly woman - a cold headmistress who had always terrified me - who dragged me down a flight of stairs.
“Don’t let them see you cry,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and are thrilled because they got you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair aboard a boat called Monkey Business and had withdrawn from the campaign, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought that there was no reason for her not to explore the idea of running for president herself.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she told me with a laugh 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the running, and the last thing they lacked was one more person.
Someone called it “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
As the campaign was very advanced, she had fallen behind in fundraising, and therefore swore that she would not participate unless she raised $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She learned that some of her supporters who usually gave $1,000 to men only intended to give her $250.
“Do they think I’m entitled to a discount?” she asked.
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so upset by her emotions — gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and target voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism — that she felt dizzy.
"You would have thought I was having a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalled of the press reaction to her.
“You would have thought Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember wondering what they were going to put on my gravestone.
“She was crying?”
How the U.S.-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The first salvos of the trade war between the United States and China have been deafening, and although the battle is far from over, a disagreement between the countries could benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest increase came this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) worth of goods, taxing half of all goods from China that arrive in the United States.
Each time, Beijing has retaliated in kind, most recently slapping 5 to 10 percent tariffs on $60 billion of U.S. goods.
China has pledged to match the United States, and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to falter anytime soon.
To push back Washington is to yield to the demands, but to publicly yield to the United States would be far too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Experts, however, believe that if Beijing can properly play its role, the pressures of the US trade war could have a positive effect on China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick policy decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions conducive to an economic slowdown in either country is actually much more dangerous than what observers have recognized before,” Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia, told the Center for New American Security think tank.
Syria 'prepared' for refugee return, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help to rebuild this country devastated by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country was improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by the terrorists in order to restore normalcy.
All conditions are now in place for the voluntary repatriation of refugees to the country they have been forced to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have deserted the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome aid for the reconstruction of this devastated country.
He stressed, however, that he would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries sponsoring the insurgency.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by beating Team USA with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the Golf National near Paris, France.
The United States have now lost six times in a row on European soil and have not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the title when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn crossed the 14.5-point mark to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled for most of the tournament, sank his shot in the water at the 16th hole in par-3, handing over his duel to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari has excelled in all his rounds, becoming one of only four players to ever reach 5-0-0 since the tournament’s current format, which first ran in 1979.
Jordan Spieth of the United States was sidelined 5-4 by the European team's worst-placed player, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The best golfer in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to the Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia became the all-time European champion with a career total of 25.5 points.
“In general, I don’t cry, but today, it’s stronger than me.
It was a hectic year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to get the cup back.
What matters is the team, and I’m happy to have been able to help him,” Garcia said with emotion after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his compatriot John Ram who beat American golf legend Tiger Woods 2-1 in singles last Sunday.
“I feel incredible pride, having beaten Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this guy,” said Rahm, 23.
Woods has lost all four of his matches in France and now holds a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A surprising statistic for one of the greatest golfers of all time, who won 14 major titles, just behind Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled all weekend to find the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk commented after a disappointing performance regarding his team: “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning we had a certain moment where we put pressure on Europe.
We gave up.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We will regroup, I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be captain.
We have to bow.
We have been overtaken.”
Red Tide Hotspot: Lower Concentrations in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fisheries and Wildlife Commission indicates a general decrease in red tide concentrations in some areas of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the CPF, more irregular flowering conditions are reported in areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte, and Collier counties – raising concerns of declining concentrations.
The red tide covers about 209 km (130 miles) of coastline, from northern Pinellas to southern Lee counties.
There are islets about 10 miles (16 km) off the coast of Hillsborough County, but at fewer sites than last week.
Red tide was also observed in Pasco County.
Moderate concentrations in or off Pinellas County were reported last week, low to high concentrations off Hillsborough County, higher concentrations in Manatee County, higher concentrations at Sarasota County Bottom or off, medium concentrations in Charlotte County and low concentrations in Lee County.
Cases of respiratory irritation persist in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
No respiratory irritation has been reported in northwestern Florida in the past week.
