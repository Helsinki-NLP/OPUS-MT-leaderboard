I don't drink alcohol.
Looks like there's no way out.
We fell asleep.
I was very annoyed by him.
Why should we help you?
I put the plan into practice.
He made a list.
For a while, I was really addicted to Coca-Cola, and I drank it every day.

I agree 100%.
These flowers besides being beautiful also have a good scent.
He's in college now, isn't he?
We should call him.
It's interesting how it happened.
You should remember that.
Tom said he likes to teach French.
He pulled a coin out of his pocket.
Are you related to her?
Who broke this window?
I'll go tell them.
If you heard him speak French, you'd mistake him for a Frenchman.
He came ten minutes later.
We waited for him yesterday.
Tom said Mary was short.
Where's the exit?
If I remember correctly, Tom sold his car to Mary for as little as $500.
I'll call you after lunch.
We didn't agree on anything!
It's very unlikely.
No doctor can explain it.
I have to try it.
You're depressed.
You guys are wasting my time.
Aren't you Mary's husband?
It was all your imagination.

He tried to get up early.
I like the blue.
They have many different fish to try.
What is the difference between real diamonds and imitations?
Could you call me later?
I would like two copies of each of these documents.
I expect I'll have to do it for Tom.
What do you think of the new teacher?
If actions are stronger than words, why is the pen more powerful than the sword?
She bought a tea set.
We're all gonna die.
Tom continued to cry.
I can't do that yet.
George was beside himself with rage!
You misled me.
Are you willing to learn?

You smell so good.
I forgot all about them.
He doesn't use it.
I'm messy.

Go ahead.
You look really pale.
Tom forgot the milk.
That song sounds familiar.
Do you have some plaster?
I'm bringing Tom some food.
I'd like to see some dancing.

Tom tried to ignore Mary.
I got home late last night.
We ran out of gas in the middle of the desert.
Don't worry, I'll get home safe and sound.

I can't run a company, it's too hard for me.
Are you learning French?
Is that your son?
Tom never asked why.
He often stayed up late.
I don't eat bananas very often.
Get them out of here.

Show me another watch.
You want to stop them?
You should have seen them run.
He and I were in the same camp at the time.
Tom doesn't know how much Mary loves him.
I think I'm being objective.
Tom hasn't heated his car yet.

What caused the accident?
Have you ever been to a foreign country?
I think I drank too much.

I waited for an hour and a half.
I'm not good at math.
Tom refused to say what he did.
I don't like his hat.
I can't be happy when Tom's so sad.
I want to share this with you.
Study at Hyogo University.
We will participate in the marathon.
Maybe you should tell her.

I have no plans for tonight.
Stop being sarcastic all the time!
She was crying.
I wish I could be as rich as you.
We had a good time.
She's dishonest.
I often read books.
Tom and I want to talk to you about something.
I can meet you at 2:30.
Tom was irritated.
I'm already old.
I have a dirty criminal record.
Good night, my friends.
I bought a book in English from a bookstore.
I'm going to the bookstore tomorrow to buy some books.

Listen to her!
You're good at this game, aren't you?
Take care of them.
I live in the Fiji Islands.
You want to eat with us?

He ate an apple.
I got him.
He adopted the orphan.
I guess they speak French.
Take a step forward.
You need to become more active.
Are Tom and Mary kidding?
She broke out of the smoke.

The village was dead after sunset.
Who is your favorite female rapper?
Say hi to Tom for me.
It's good to see her so happy.
I usually swim in the summer.
Why is he leaving so soon?
I'm pretty proud of that.

Here's a picture of him.
I can depend on my friends.
The experiment confirmed his theory.
Tom is lucky.
Pass me the ketchup, please.
It happened that I sat next to her at a conference.
There is no furniture left in the room.
Tom showed up early for the lesson.
He's a little overweight, isn't he?
Who is the man who is playing the piano?
I decided not to do it again.
No, I haven't written it yet.
You have to listen to Tom.
He slept in the car.
Tom and I are going to Boston with Mary.
He spent all his income on drinking.
Search harder on Google!
That's not the only problem with your idea.
You talk like you're the boss.
You want me to go with you?
I came to see you.
Does it look familiar?
I'll check your game tomorrow.
So, what am I supposed to tell him?
It's starting to rain.
Do you play any instruments?
Will they die?
I really like it.
Are you guys coming in?
Tom stabbed her.
I have no feelings.
She's incredibly stupid.

I forgot if he drinks wine or not.
Who warned them?
Have faith in God.
"I'll give 50 grand for this statue. "Who will offer more?"
Why would anyone want to kiss her?
You should have bought a used car.
I'm going to stay at the hotel.
I didn't grow up like that.
You can park here.
Please tell him to hurry.
Tom hated them.
I miss almost every day.
I won't apologize.
We really like picnics.
I haven't talked to him yet.
It was a hot summer evening.
I always walk.
It's decisive.
You're not much fun at parties, are you?
He searched his bag for the car keys.
I don't really want to talk.
So he must be Argentine.
I really like my job.
I suggest you be more careful.
She's shaken.
You should have done it yesterday.
I am a big fan of American cuisine.
Tom's dancing with Mary.
Your destiny is in my hands.
No, you don't have to go now.

If you really want to know, all you have to do is ask.
We need to inform Tom.
Tom's still asleep.
Tom's a little impulsive, isn't he?
You agree with Tom, right?
Tom didn't take much money.

You think Tom killed Mary?
Why don't you have anything to say?
Outrageous!
Come on, Tom, aren't you curious?
Keep your tongue in check.

He's more popular than me.
When can I get out of here?
You're early again.
We left this.
All I want to do is go fishing.
You want to take this?
Tom didn't want to go back to the orphanage.

Let's open it.
It is sickness to be obsessed with victory, it is sickness to be obsessed with using martial arts, and it is sickness to be obsessed with presenting everything you have learned. It is sickness to be obsessed with attack, and it is sickness also to be obsessed with defense. It is sickness also to be obsessed with getting rid of sickness. Fixing the mind obsessively on anything is considered sickness.

Let me be his alibi.
He was walking slowly down the road.
It only takes 15 minutes, right?

How are your summer holidays going?
I don't like poker at all.
How is your job search going?
I heard Tom was killed.
I was ready to do it.
Tom is silly.
Mike returned from the library at five.
I didn't vote for Tom.
He was seen crossing the street.
I'm like my brother.
I'm gonna go.
Do you really think it's necessary?
Everyone on the road was surprised.
Who? Who?
Write your name here.
It's very selfish, isn't it?
I could try.
He got lost while walking in the woods.
How long will you stay?
Tom and Mary are really jealous, aren't they?
They gave an answer to every question.
Please fill the front.

Do you still collect stamps?
It's not for them.

Why don't you wear that hat anymore?
The report was soon known throughout the country.
I love your daughter.
Are you as bored as me?

What kind of beer do you have?
We are used to living in a big city.
They are our dearest friends.
The climate in Japan is generally mild.
I had three exams today.
I had no idea she was coming.
I'm sorry, but I'm not paid enough to worry.

Don't you understand yet?
Can you teach me how to play chess?
What time should I wake you up?
There's no one here.
You should apologize to them.
I would like to buy a dog.
Layla wondered where Sami was.
Take Tom out.
I was happy at the time.
I told you I'm not hungry.
Tom's messy, isn't he?
They said they were embarrassed.
Please, take them.
Please come home.
I like professional wrestling.
Tom is smart.
Don't be so formal, please!
You think that's a clue?
I don't think Tom's jokes are particularly funny.
He does everything very quickly.
Please don't kill me!
I bit my lip.
You're a moralist.
She's always been a hothead.
She likes beans.
I'm having trouble falling asleep.
The relief is instant.
Lida is a close friend of Mary's.
Please don't interrupt me while I'm talking.
I hope to participate.

She ate an apple.
Don’t judge people by their appearance.
She's jealous.
OK. Right. I understand what you mean.
You'll be safe here.
Are you proud of your father?
Tom is gruff.
You have already been to Berlin.
You are too young to be in love.
You stay awake.
Tom, where'd you put my passport?
Now lie down.
He finally decided to get married.
Can I use your phone?
There's nothing we can do?

I won't talk about it.
I'm a fucking economist.
Tom wouldn't understand.
You want something to drink?
I'm here to help you.
He was too drunk to drive home.
I heard voices.
I respected Tom.
So what happened next?
She's ready now.
Go play with him.
Now go brush your teeth.
I can't fire them.
He had a fit of rage.
Don't make a noise while you're eating the soup.
Please, go to the supermarket and buy some fruit.
I realized I wasn't ready.
Mr. White went to Canada.
You think Tom's funny?
She's not sure she's going back to her husband's house.
I'll be right with it.
He said he wasn't interested.
What does the note say?
I don't have to account to you for my actions.
Mr. Gomez didn't apologize for my mistake.
Is he a foreigner?
I think you're perfect.

It was a good choice.
The frost caused a lot of damage to the crops.
Tom deserves an explanation.
Try to think about it.
Are you ready to learn Klingon?
Who wrote "The Prince"?
I'll pretend this never happened.
Sometimes, a little pride is what we need.
Tom lost his money, his family and his friends.
He lives here all alone.
She convinced me.
Luck has nothing to do with it.
You kissed him, didn't you?
Why isn't Tom here today?
That should be interesting.
He moved west to Nashville, Tennessee.
I'll call you back later.
Where do you want to go?
Tom knows exactly how Mary feels.
Have you ever heard Tom sing?
Didn't Tom tell you?
You misled me.
Can rabbits swim?

Call my wife.
They'll understand.

Feed the bird.
You know I love Tom, right?
I can't give Mary everything she wants.
He's coming at noon.
You're a busy person, aren't you?
Tom asked everyone to leave.
I'm very frustrated.
She cried when she heard the terrible news.
I'm afraid it's too late to say no.

It's probably a mistake.
He is a famous painter and should be treated as such.
Our cities create serious pollution problems.
Tom has a job.
How dare you talk to me like that!
Tell him to leave.
I absolutely love autumn.
Tom is suspicious.
The good news is that we will be able to help you.
I usually take a bath before going to bed.
What I want is a word processor.
What brought you to Boston?
Do I bother you sometimes?
You want me to leave now?
We are outraged.
I hope you had a great day!
I'm feeling stressed.
Mary laughed.
We all wanted revenge.
Tom will never agree.
I'm diligent.
I'm sure they're talking about us.
I'm lucky today.
He looks like a baboon.
"Do you have a dog?" "No."
He has a strange character.
Have faith in God.
Promise me you'll help them.
I wonder why Tom's not here.
Many people thought he was too young to be president.

Our train arrived late.
Why is Tom looking at me?
I asked Tom to play the guitar.
What's Tom like when he's angry?
He's so lazy.
Help Tom study.
Do you like to travel?
Do you like Tom?
I don't want to be afraid of Tom anymore.
What keeps you up so late?
You don't have a wife, do you?
It was sudden.
Just use mine for now.
He risked his life to save her.
We can't be friends anymore.
He didn't give me anything.

You let Tom kiss you?
How old could your grandfather be?

Do you have oranges?
Looks like Tom's annoyed.
I know you've spent the last three years in prison.
That's the rule.
The office is deserted.
She's sleeping a lot.
Don't hold it the other way around.
We must preserve our peaceful constitution.
This is a man dressed as a woman.
Tom is impassive.
Could you call him?
You will be surprised at what you can learn in a week.
Tom has a house with two rooms.
Don't say stupid things!
Give them the keys.
Could you tell me how to get to the station?
It's already good.
I think Tom's flexible.
We'll wait for Tom in the lobby.
I've made a fool of myself.
It was dangerous.
She was happy with the new dress.
You see this?
Tom has no empathy.
Is Tom busy?
He could die.
It depends too much on him.
Tom is kind to me.
It's not gonna happen.
Tom is home, but Mary is not.
Forget about him.
You're different.
I wasn't angry.
Tom died.
I know you hate school.
The daughters of my late mother have signed up for Facebook.

It's unpredictable.
This diving watch is a bit too expensive.

Put your books away.
His days are numbered.
Tom does what he wants.
The river flooded the entire region.
You'd better fight sleep.
It really sucks.
I have to go help her.
Sami waited.
I forgot his address.
Were you in love with them?
Hey, did you hear that?
Tom went to France two months ago.
I'm pretty weak right now.
Tom couldn't control himself.
You never trust Tom.
I don't look like Tom at all.
Our work never ends.
You know Tom likes Mary.
Why was it so slow?
We have seen three wars.
The flowers bloom.
Let's go see them.
Do you study French?
In 1900 he left England and never returned.

What method did you use to quit smoking?
The Moraleses are in the room.
We went to the beach.
I think they'll be late.
Tom is annoyed.
You shouldn't listen to me.
It doesn't change anything.
You don't have to change.
Oh, look, they're kissing!
I wish he had attended the conference.
Tom was taken to the emergency room.
I have a question for you.
Tom called at 2:30.
I live in Osaka.
I'm a doctor, Jim, not a lawyer.
I'm keeping this place for you.
Tom didn't know who Mary was.
I'm not gonna find a woman who's in arrears.
Today the weather is nice.
It didn't matter to anybody.
You're from Urumqi?
Let me take you to the hospital.
We love what we do.
Together everything is possible!
I want you to be better.
He didn't come back.
You'd better go help them.
He ordered him not to give orders.
I think Tom's in trouble.
I would like you to accompany him.
Have you been to Cairo?
She's got to get out.
I'm not worried about you.
What do you want to do for work?
We want to meet him.
Do you like songs?
You really think Tom's being honest?
I'm getting married soon.
They added a woman to the committee.

Sami doesn't celebrate Halloween.
You'll never see them again.
I tried to contact him.
He made room for an elderly woman on the bus.
What are you doing here?
It's a delicate matter.
I went to see a movie with Tom after work.
There always will be.
I'm trying to avoid them.
No one can understand that.
I'm getting weak!
He's quite overweight, isn't he?
I never believed him.
I'm not his angel anymore.
Tom probably won't be shy.
Let him recite the poems.
She closed a door.
I don't want Tom to do it here.
I'm in Rome.
Tom gave Mary a Christmas present.
I can tell you're angry.
She passed away yesterday afternoon.
You were blindfolded?
We're getting help.
This guy tried to kill me.
We arrived in New York at night.
Why did Tom kiss Mary?
Come on, don't be silly.
It's a little late for that, don't you think?
I shouldn't have trusted you.
They all knew you.
Why did you sign the confession?
I know Tom's guilty.
You only have two options.
You seem surprised.
I'll ask around.
I don't remember anything.
Tom speaks perfect French.
He bought bread.
Tom started working immediately.
Do you like this flower?
Do you know Mr. Jackson?
I shouldn't have stayed.
Tom's trying to fix his car.
You think Tom's still up?
Why are you giving Tom money?
It could be better.
You really hate that way of thinking.
Do not associate with them.
I speak French.
Here's an even better idea.
We're all done here.
At the moment, I don't have a plan.
He calls him often.
She's a musicologist.
Why are you giving Tom money?
The kids know that, too.
Mary made breakfast for her husband.
I wanted to talk to you about something.
We should have tried harder.
Which one is yours?
I just changed my mind.
I said I was hungry.
I have not read any of those books.
Liisa was fed up with the noise.
Tom was in the garden.
It's touchy, isn't it?
Are you wearing glasses?
Are you sure Tom won't be mad?
Tom's gonna call the cops.
Please fill the front.
Tom forgot his umbrella again.
Do you have a cell phone?
It seems to me that he is honest.
Don't turn off the light.
They still live with their parents.
Who doesn't like that?
They used the truth serum.
You're allowed to do that.
I didn't know what to say.
I'm feeling really good.
Give me some.
This is Tony.
He's rich, but he's a pain in the ass.
Read the book out loud.
I think I'll go get them.
Where did you exchange them?
I asked Tom and Mary for their keys.
He said he'd call me.

I was able to save them.
You think Tom's guilty?
Why would we want to punish you?
We're not disappointed.
Your handwriting is unreadable.

I'm tired of singing.
Tom won't buy a new car.
Do you love her?
Tell her we're busy.
Is Tom around?
I need to talk to him now.
I can't see them.
No one will know.
Do you want to do business or not?
He asked for a beer.
