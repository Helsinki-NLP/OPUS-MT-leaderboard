USA Gymnastics supports the U.S. Olympic Committee’s letter and recognizes the absolute need for the Olympic community to strive to create a safe environment for all its athletes.
We agree with the USOC statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, and their sport, can best be served by meaningful change within our organization, not by decertification.
USA Gymnastics has launched an independent investigation to understand how it was possible that an abuse of the size so courageously described by those who managed to survive Larry Nassar remained hidden for so long, and is willing to implement any necessary or appropriate change.
USA Gymnastics and USOC have the same goal: to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible, so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a reliable, positive and empowered environment.

This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widely held, but provides greater detail than fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
. According to scientists, the plumage of this animal was chestnut brown at the top, with a pale or carotenoid coloration at the bottom.
The discovery also provides detailed information about the evolution of bird feathers.
Since the dinosaur’s plumage lacks the basic structure, the so-called rachis, but instead has other characteristics typical of feathers, beards and barbels, the researchers concluded that the rachis is likely the result of evolutionary development following such characteristics.
The structure of the plumage suggests that it was not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or courtship. The researchers speculate that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the find shows an adult plumage and not the chick feather.
According to the hypothesis of the researchers, although the tail belongs to a young dinosaur, the sample reveals a plumage from an adult specimen and not that of a chick.

They found that the Sun's functioning is based on the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all stars in the solar system is determined by nothing more than their brightness and rotation.
The luminosity is used together with the rotation to define the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the flow of plasma.
The lower the Rossby number, the lower the activity of the star compared to magnetic inversions.

The activity carried out was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate the surveys made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for had to be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of this galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts an attractive force on the Earth that generates the tides, the Milky Way also exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to infer that the effects of dark matter on other dark matter are the same effects that “normal” matter has.
This theory holds that much of the dark matter around a galaxy is collected in a kind of halo, formed by a multitude of small particles.

Dr Tony Moll has identified extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African province of KwaZulu-Natal.
According to a statement released in an interview, this new variant was “highly worrying and alarming, due to the high mortality rate.”
According to Dr. Moll, some patients may have contracted the microbe inside the hospital, and at least two of them were health workers at the hospital itself.
Over the course of a year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.

Glen Cushing of the team of astrogeologists from the US Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona, said: "Their thermal behavior is not constant like that of large terrestrial caves, which often maintain a relatively stable temperature, but is consistent with the fact that they are deep holes in the ground."
In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters enter an isolated booth and put in an envelope a preprinted sheet that indicates the chosen candidate.
After verification of his identity by the officials, the voter deposits the envelope in the ballot box and signs the electoral register.

Since 1988, the ballot boxes must be transparent, so that voters and observers can testify that there are no envelopes at the beginning of the vote and that no envelopes other than those of the voters, duly counted and authorized, are inserted.
Candidates can send their representatives to attend each stage of the process. In the evening, volunteers carry out the counting of votes under strict control, in accordance with specific procedures.

The victims were Nicholas Alden, 25, and the driver, Zachary Cuddeback, 21.
Edgar Veguilla has injuries to his arm and jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider will have to undergo surgery to reconstruct his face.
Uka's weapon did not explode when it was pointed at the head of a fifth man. Schneider has constant pain, is blind in one eye, lacks a skull section, and his face was reconstructed in titanium.
Schneider testified via videoconference from a USAF base in his country.
In addition to Wednesday's event, Carpanedo participated in two individual championship races.
The first in the slalom, where at the first descent he registered a DNT. Another 36 competitors out of 116 in the same race did not finish the test.
The other race she took part in, the giant slalom, saw her place tenth in the women's group in the "sitting" category, with a combined travel time of 4:41.30, slower by 2:11.60 minutes than the first classified, the Austrian Claudia Loesch, and slower by 1:09.02 minutes compared to the ninth place of the Hungarian Gy<0xC3><0xB6>ngyi.
Four female skiers failed to finish their descents, and 45 of the 117 participants in the Giant Slalom failed to qualify for the race.
Police in Madhya Pradesh were able to recover the laptop and mobile phone that had been stolen.
The deputy inspector general, DK Arya, announced: "Five people have been arrested for the rape of the Swiss woman. We also found her cell phone and her laptop."
The names of the defendants are: Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
According to police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the defendants appeared in court with their faces covered.
None of the three people who were in the house at the time of the car crash were injured.
Nevertheless, the driver was seriously injured in the head.
The road where the accident took place was temporarily closed, while rescue services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been at the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court on charges of killing her own son.
She is being held pending retrial and trial, but any testimony given by an eyewitness could be polluted, as her image has been widely publicized.
This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but Scottish justice has other parameters, as Scottish courts have deemed the publication of the photos potentially prejudicial.
According to Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee, "journalists who publish photos or other suspicious subjects, walk on a minefield".
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for judicial proceedings, has told reporters that no new comments will be released at least until the formal indictment.
According to the leaked document, the dispute over the borders, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders existing before the 1967 Middle East War, will be the subject of the document.
Other issues include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Once the agreement is signed, Israel demands a constant military presence in the valley, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to abandon that presence only for five years.
Shooters within the experimental program for the control of harmful animals had to be carefully supervised by rangers, since the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
As part of the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters Association, NPWS in collaboration with the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., recruited qualified volunteers.
According to Mick O’Flynn, acting director of NPWS Park Conservation and Heritage, the four shooters chosen for the first shooting operation received extensive training and safety instructions.
Yesterday Martelly was sworn into a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) composed of nine members.
This is Martelly’s fifth interim electoral council in four years.
Last month a presidential commission proposed a package of measures aimed at pushing the country towards new elections, including the resignation of the previous CEP.
The commission was Martelly’s response to widespread protests, which began in October, challenging the regime.
The occasionally violent protests were sparked by the failure to hold elections, some of which have been planned since 2011.
About 60 cases of overheating of malfunctioning iPods have been reported, which caused a total of six fires and caused minor burns to four people.
Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 device-related incidents.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that it had been informed by Apple of 34 other incidents related to overheating, which the company called "not serious".
In its response, the ministry called Apple’s postponement of the report “absolutely deplorable.”
The Mariana earthquake was felt at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
According to the Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office, no damage has been reported in the country.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that there were no tsunami signals in place.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former Philippine policeman has taken Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus.
With his M16 rifle Rolando Mendoza fired on the tourists.
Many of the hostages were rescued, at least six have died.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were immediately released along with Filipino photographers.
The photographers then replaced an elderly lady who needed to use the bathroom. Mendoza was shot to death.
Liggins retraced his father’s footsteps and embarked on a career as a doctor.
After attending midwifery training, she entered the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While serving at the hospital, Liggins began studying cases of preterm labor in his spare time.
His research showed that the administration of a hormone would accelerate the maturation of the lungs in the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators on Wednesday recovered two “black boxes” with flight records.
His wrestling teammates also wanted to pay tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first Queen of the Extreme. My first manager. She died on the night of the two moons. Unique, just like her. A strong woman."
"Luna was weird like me... maybe even weirder... I love her and I'll miss her... We hope she's in a better place," said Dustin "Goldust" Runnels.
According to the survey of 1,400 people conducted before the 2010 federal election, people opposed to Australia's transition to a republic increased by 8% compared to 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed to believe that Australia should become a republic at the end of Elizabeth II's reign.
This opinion is shared by 34% of survey participants, according to which Queen Elizabeth II should be the last monarch of Australia.
In contrast, 29 per cent of respondents said Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 per cent said it should never become one.
The Olympic gold medallist was expected to compete in the 100 and 200 metres freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but she has suffered from several ailments that have led to doubts about her fitness.
He couldn’t take the medications necessary to overcome the pain because they are banned from the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number known to date.
The discovery was verified by several people through the use of various hardware and software in early February, and was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been one of the sources that brought water and organic matter to Earth, which is the stuff that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists want to understand how planets form, and in particular how the Earth formed, having collided with comets long ago.
Cuomo, 53, has been in office since earlier this year as governor; last month he put his signature on a law making same-sex marriage legal.
According to him, speculations are nothing more than "political gossip and idiocy".
He is expected to run for the presidency in 2016.
According to the FAA, the NextGen system would allow aircraft to cover shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel per year, thereby reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
The system uses satellite technology instead of outdated ground-based radar technology to enable air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport is being set up and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, while on-site car parks or interchange parking are not available.
Fears related to the absence of means of transport have highlighted the possibility of compulsorily playing the game behind closed doors, without the support of the fans of the team.
According to a study published Thursday in the journal Science, a new species of bird was born on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
According to researchers at Princeton University, USA, and Uppsala University, Sweden, the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was believed that the time required for this process was much longer; this was due to the mating between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into any kind of shape. It can be rolled up to create tiny shapes.
It can be pulled up to form a thin thread, suitable for being twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metals. Sometimes it has been used to decorate the hand-painted images in books called "enlightened codes" precisely because of the possibility of being made so thin.
This is the so-called pH of the substance. Using red cabbage juice you can build a pH indicator.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical element is.
The pH level of the chemical analyzed is given by the amount of hydrogen ions present (the pH letter H).
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of electrons (since hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dried powders together and then, with clean and wet hands, stick them into a ball.
Between the moisture on your hands and the outer layers will trigger a reaction that will cause a strange feeling and form a kind of shell.
Almost all houses in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a bath with running water equipped with a connection to an advanced sewage system.
In Greece, in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, remains of sewers have been discovered.
Toilets in antiquity also existed in Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization they were sometimes inserted in public toilets, attended by a mixed audience of men and women.
To call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and then sends it back almost instantly.
The launch of the satellite into space was carried out with a rocket. Scientists resort to space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere partially distorts light and vision.
To carry a satellite or telescope into space, a rocket over 100 feet high is required.
The wheel has changed the world enormously. Among the various advantages it has offered us, the most important is to have provided us with simpler and faster transport.
Thanks to his invention, the train, the car and several other means of transport made their appearance.
Below them are other medium-sized felines that feed on medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including domestic cats in the wild) that feed on small prey, considerably more numerous, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The concept of niche is the secret of their success, a particular goal that each feline has and that allows him not to compete with others.
Lions are the most social felines and live in numerous groups called herds.
The herds are composed of adult males, usually 2 or 3 related to each other, and a number of females and puppies that can reach 30.
Females are usually closely related to each other, being a large family of daughters and sisters.
The pack of lions acts in a very similar way to the pack of wolves or dogs, whose behavior is in fact surprisingly similar to that of lions (but not to that of other large cats), also with regard to the deadly attacks on their prey.
A complete athlete: the tiger is able to climb (albeit not too well), swim, make very long jumps and exert a traction force five times greater than that of a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same family (the genus Panthera) as the lion, leopard and jaguar. These four felines are the only ones to roar.
The roar of the tiger is not as powerful as that of the lion, but more like a phrase of screaming and angry words.
Ocelots like to feed on small animals. If possible, they hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds and almost all the prey they catch are much smaller than them.
Scientists believe that the ocelots follow and find the animals to eat (prey) thanks to the smell, sniffing on the ground where they have been.
Thanks to the night vision they are able to see very well in the dark, as well as being able to move stealthily. To hunt their prey, the ocelots camouflage with the surrounding environment and then pounce on them.
When a small group of living things (a small population) separates from the main population to which it belongs (for example if it moves beyond a mountain range or a river, or moves to a new island, thus making it difficult to return), it will probably find itself in a different environment than it was before.
This new environment is characterized by different resources and competitors, therefore, to pose as a strong competitor, the new population will need different characteristics or transformations than previously necessary.
The original population has not changed at all; it continues to need the same adaptations as before.
Over time and as the new population adapts to its new environment, it looks less and less like the other population.
At some point, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different from each other that they can no longer be defined as belonging to the same species.
This process, which consists in the formation of new species, is called speciation. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and is a fundamental element of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that is breathed by humans and absorb the carbon dioxide expelled by them (through exhalation).
Plants process their nourishment with the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our homes from plants and produce clothes with plants. Much of the food we eat is made of plants. Without plants animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the superpredator of its era and therefore feared nothing but the other mosasaurs.
From his long jaws sprang more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus an additional row located on the palate, so for anyone who crossed his path there was no escape.
We do not know for sure, but it is possible that he had a forked tongue. His diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs and it is also possible that he was a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex could not compete with it.
Although much of their food would seem familiar, Roman banquets also included several odd or unusual courses, such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a species of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor and the women ate while sitting on chairs, the rich men enjoyed feasting together while lying on their side as they ate their meal.
Of course, the meals of the ancient Romans did not include different foods, which came to Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built for each deity a main temple, which was considered the dwelling place of the god.
People brought sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to provide for the needs of the deities through ceremonies and feasts.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an internal sanctuary accessible only to priests.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers were built, called ziggurat, which became part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a sanctuary dedicated to the god.
Thanks to the mild climate that characterizes the Middle East, the house was not of fundamental importance.
Much of the life of the Jewish family took place outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard, while the shops were simple outdoor counters overlooking the street. The stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, so wood was particularly expensive.
In the Norse sagas, Erik the Red is said to have been the one who gave his name to Greenland, having encountered Greenland on his journey after being exiled from Iceland for murder.
But, regardless of its discovery, at that time the Eskimo tribes already lived there.
Although they were all "Scandinavian" countries, the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland had very different characteristics.
If you have seen the movie "The Mystery of the Templars", you might think that a treasure map is drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Even if there's something on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence is the inscription "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776". The text appears upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although it is not known for sure who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its existence the large document of parchment (measured 29.75 inches by 24.5 inches) was rolled up to be stored.
Probably, therefore, the annotation was affixed only as a label.
The D-Day landings and ensuing clashes had brought northern France to liberation, but the south was still occupied.
It was ruled by the Vichy regime, that is, by those French who in 1940 had made peace with the Germans and allied themselves with the invaders, instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France: this offensive action was called "Operation Dragoon".
American and Free French forces had liberated southern France in just two weeks and were on their way to Germany.
Civilization is a specific culture, shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work collaboratively, constituting a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin "civilis", which means civil; the term is in turn connected with "civis", that is citizen, and "civitas", that is city or city-state, and in a certain way also defines the dimensions of society.
The city-states are the first realities to anticipate the idea of nation. Culture of civilization means transmitting knowledge through several generations, leaving an indelible cultural imprint through an equitable diffusion.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical traces, thus not being recognized as real civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states formed a weak central government for the first time, and Congress was the sole component, according to the Statute of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes and, given the absence of executive or judicial power at the national level, relied on state authorities, often uncooperative, for the enforcement of its acts.
It did not even have the authority to bypass tax and duty laws between states.
In order to amend the articles, the unanimous consent of all the states was required; the latter, for their part, had so little regard for the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, together with the German one, the second most successful football team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the most popular sports are: football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, track hockey and Formula 1 motor racing.
Winter sports are more prevalent in the northern regions and see Italians competing in international competitions and Olympic events.
Almost 7,000 islands are part of Japan (the largest is Honshu), and this makes Japan the seventh largest archipelago in the world!
From a geographical point of view, Japan is referred to as an "archipelago", considering the presence of groups of islands that make up it.
Taiwan was born in the fifteenth century, when European sailors who transited there soon register the name of the island with the name of Formosa Island, or wonderful island.
The Dutch East India Company in 1624 established a base in the southwestern part of Taiwan, initiating a transformation that concerned the cereal production systems of the aborigines and hiring Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan came under the control of Qing dynasty forces (1644–1912); in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
After being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, ceding Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan; the island remained under Japanese rule until 1945.
Machu Picchu comprises three primary structures, notably the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the outlying buildings have been rebuilt to give tourists a more accurate idea of their original appearance.
In 1976, 30% of the site of Machu Picchu had been recovered, but restoration work is still ongoing.
The most common format in the world for still photography, for example, is 35 mm, the same as the most used film at the end of the era of analog photography.
It is still produced today and, most importantly, its aspect ratio is inherited from the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
Strangely, the height of the 35 mm format is 24 mm and its width is 36 mm.
The proportions of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest ratio of integers) are therefore considered 3:2.
The proportions of many of the common formats (for example the family of APS formats) are equal to or very close to this value.
The much-exploited and often mocked rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a measure of order within an image.
According to this rule, the most effective point where to place the main subject corresponds to the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds, both vertically and horizontally (as in the example).
At this stage of European history, the Catholic Church, having become rich and powerful, decided to be under scrutiny.
The Christian religion had acted as a glue between European states for over a thousand years, despite linguistic and customary differences.
His omnipresent power has influenced everyone, from the king to ordinary citizens.
One of the foundations of Christianity is that wealth must serve to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the monetary reserves of the church exist precisely for this reason.
The central authority of the church has remained in Rome for over a thousand years and this convergence of power and money has led many to question whether this principle has been respected.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain decided to implement a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective: it provided for the interruption of any essential military and civilian supplies, despite this blockade violating international law usually accepted and codified by multiple international treaties of the last two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent access by any vessel to entire sections of the ocean, putting neutral ships at risk as well.
Because this tactic had elicited a limited response, Germany expected a similar reaction to its indiscriminate submarine warfare campaign.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and heinous acts of World War I, the nations wished to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla accepted a job offer at the Edison Company in New York City and this led him to move to the United States of America.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation written by Charles Batchelor (his manager in the previous work) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China the different time periods were indicated in a very singular way: each period of China or each family that was in power constituted a specific dynasty.
The intervals between the individual dynasties were also characterized by periods of instability and division between the provinces. The best known was the so-called Three Kingdoms period, between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty, which lasted for 60 years.
During these periods, fierce wars broke out among many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the most violent epochs in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died fighting for a place of honor in the imposing palace of Xi'an.
The social and political effects are numerous, among them the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to the republic, nationalism and the conviction that the nation belongs to the people and is not owned by a single sovereign.
In addition, after the Revolution the professions were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and fortunate to succeed.
The same goes for the military, since army rankings, instead of being class-based, are now calibre-based.
The French Revolution was also a source of inspiration for many other oppressed workers from various countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad had a deep interest in matters that go beyond earthly life. He used to go to a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of the "noor" (light) to meditate.
The cave, which has survived the passage of time, in itself offers a very clear picture of Muhammad's spirituality.
The cave rests on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, completely detached from the rest of the world.
In fact it is not at all easy to find, even if one knew of its existence. Once inside the cave, the isolation is total.
You can see nothing but a wonderful clear sky and a lot of mountains around. From inside the cave you can see or feel very little of the surrounding world.
Among the seven wonders of the world, the Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one that has not come to this day in a state of ruin.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of the great pyramid structures built in honor of the dead pharaoh.
The Giza plain, or "Necropolis of Giza", in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, is home to numerous pyramids (the largest of which is the Pyramid of Cheops), various smaller tombs, various temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The important pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Cheops, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Pharaoh’s wives and family members.
The indication "bow up" resembles a V and the indication "bow down" resembles a staple or a square without the lower side.
Upward means that you should start from the tip and push the bow, and downward means that you should start from the amaranth (which is where your hand supports the bow) and pull the bow towards you.
An ascending arc usually generates a softer sound, while a descending arc results in a louder and more decisive sound.
You can decide to add your personalized indications in pencil, but keep in mind that the signs of the archery that you find printed have a musical value, so in principle they should be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a mob of market women forced King Louis XVI, in terror, to leave Versailles to return to Paris, along with Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Mary Thér<0xC3><0xA8>se aged 11 and Louis Charles aged 4) and Elizabeth, the king's sister.
With a carriage they returned to Paris, surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and shouting threats against the sovereigns.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point someone in the crowd showed the terrified queen the head of a royal guard who had been killed at Versailles.
The war expenses of U.S. imperialism incurred to conquer the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover much of the expenses, and interest on the bonds fluctuated in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking institutions.
Clearly, the enormous gains from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people formed the basis of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars one must know the context that led to the creation of this order.
The time in which the events took place is commonly called the High Middle Ages, the period of European history covering the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (from the year 1000 to 1300 AD).
The Middle Ages were preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended by convention in about 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that includes in practice a wide range of ideas, from technological innovation or the technological imperative to the narrow sense according to which the destiny of man is moved by an underlying logic, associated with scientific laws and their realization in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism have two general ideas in common: one is that the development of technology itself follows a path that goes far beyond political and cultural influence, and the other is that technology in turn has “effects” on societies that are intrinsic, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, we can say that the car necessarily involves a development of the road network.
However, a national road network for just a few cars is not economically sustainable, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the costs of owning a car.
The mass possession of cars also leads to a higher percentage of accidents on the roads, and consequently the invention of new rescue techniques for the care of injured people.
Romanticism was characterized by a consistent component of cultural determinism, drawn from authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the framework of romanticism, geography has conditioned individuals, and over time there have arisen customs, customs and culture linked to such geography that, being in harmony with the context of society, they have been more effective than laws imposed arbitrarily.
Similarly in Paris, known today as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its notoriety as a hub of luxury began around 400 A.D. and continued until about 1100 A.D.
During the 12th century its prestige declined, mainly because the Crusaders returned bringing gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more than the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this point that the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The highest point of the Gothic style was reached in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
Initially the clothing was heavily influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
But the slowness of the communication routes means that the spread of styles in the West can be delayed by 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant developments of the time, as a result of the Crusades, was the introduction of buttons to fasten clothes.
Agriculture is defined as subsistence when it is practiced for the sole purpose of producing enough to satisfy the food needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple system, usually of an organic type, that uses preserved seeds originating in the ecological region in association with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques aimed at getting the most out of crops.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence farming, and in many developing countries this is still the case.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who do not feel represented by societal standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are distinguished by age, ethnicity, social class, position, and/or sex of their members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinctive can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a set of factors.
Often members of a subculture indicate their membership through a peculiar and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, manners, and slang.
One of the most commonly used methods to explain the importance of socialization is to analyze some unhappy cases of children who, due to neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse, have grown up without proper socialization with adults.
These children are called "feral" or wild. Some of them have been segregated by people (often their own parents): in some cases the abandonment is motivated by the refusal of a serious intellectual or physical impairment by the parents.
Feral children may have suffered severe violence or trauma prior to abandonment or escape.
Other children may have been raised by animals; others still seem to have lived alone in the wild.
When the feral child is totally raised by non-human animals, he shows behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely analogous to those of the particular animal that took care of him, such as fear or indifference towards man.
Project-based learning should make learning itself simpler and more interesting, while the scaffolding goes a little further.
Scaffolding is not a way of learning, but rather an aid for those who embark on a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is an example of "scaffolding", but so is the small paperclip assistant in Microsoft Office.
The virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and are intended to interrogate, solicit and explain the procedures that the student may have had difficulty managing on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from abandonment to abuse, and even extortion.
A child should never grow up in an environment that does not guarantee him nourishment, care and training, but it happens to them.
We believe that foster care is a safe area for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving foster parents, stable education, and reliable health care.
The care is supposed to cover all the unmet needs in the house from which they were taken.
The Internet brings together some elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The characteristic elements of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the theory of uses and gratifications.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord's (1998) study of public reactions to websites identified two new aspects of motivation, namely "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships".
The use of video recording has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that it is possible to find out if a person is lying by interpreting microexpressions correctly.
In his essay “The President’s Speech,” Oliver Sacks illustrated how people unable to understand spoken language due to brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even argues that such abilities in interpreting human behavior can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
In the 20th century, research has shown the existence of two pools of genetic variability, namely hidden variability and expressed variability.
With the mutation a new genetic variability is added, with the selection it is eliminated from the pool of variability expressed.
Generation after generation, segregation and recombination redistribute the variability back and forth between the two pools.
For a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans, it is difficult to meet its amino acid needs with the plant resources available in the savannah.
In addition, the failure to carry out such activities has serious consequences: slowing growth, malnutrition and, ultimately, even death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins present in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us they are difficult to digest unless they are cooked.
Animal foods (such as ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but provide a high amount of protein, containing all the essential amino acids.
In light of all this, it should come as no surprise that our own ancestors have solved their “protein problem” in some ways like savanna chimpanzees do today.
Interruption of sleep is the process of intentional awakening that occurs during the normal sleep period, followed by a resumption of sleep (10–60 minutes later).
This process can be easily put into practice by using a relatively silent alarm clock to bring you into a state of consciousness, without waking you up completely.
Should you decide to reset the clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, so you will be forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-focused options include drinking plenty of fluids before bedtime (especially water or tea, known for its diuretic properties), which force you to get out of bed to urinate.
A person enjoys an inner peace proportionately opposed to the tension existing in his body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the existing life force. Each of us has the potential ability to find absolute peace and fulfillment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. This goal is only hindered by our tension and our negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been enriched by the love path of the Mahayana rite and various techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It is based on Kundalini Yoga, meditation and an all-encompassing path of love.
Kundalini Yoga activates the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) through the use of yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
Deity Yoga is the fulcrum of Tibetan meditation. Through the representation of various deities the energy channels are cleaned, the chakras are activated and the consciousness of enlightenment is developed.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to collaboration between the USSR and the United States. With the end of the war, system conflicts, procedural and cultural, caused the break between the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies had become enemies; thus began the Cold War.
It would last for the next 40 years and would be fought for real, by mercenary armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other countries.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defence had already been broken through; the only option was to retreat and reorganise along the Romanian bridgehead.
These plans proved to be obsolete, however, as more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers advanced and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after invading Poland's eastern regions, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet–Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international, bilateral, and multilateral treaties.
Exploiting ships for the transport of goods is certainly the most efficient way to move large volumes of people and goods across the oceans.
The task of the navies has always been to guarantee the country the safeguarding of its ability to move people and goods, while countering the same ability of the enemies to move their people and their goods.
One of the recent examples supporting this theory and most noteworthy is the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II. During the battle, the Americans tried to move men and goods across the Atlantic Ocean to support Britain.
At the same time the German navy, using mainly submarines, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany would probably have had the chance to conquer Britain, just as it had in the rest of Europe.
Apparently, goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago on the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
They began to be bred by the cultures and tribes of antiquity to have easily available milk, fleece, meat and skin.
Domestic goats were usually bred in herds left free to roam the hills or other grazing areas, often cared for by goats (similar to shepherds) who were often children or adolescents. These methods of herding are still used today.
In the 16th century, wagons were built in England.
Although formed simply by parallel wooden axles, wagonways, when compared to the slightly more rugged roads of the period, allowed the horses that rode through them to reach greater speeds and move heavier loads.
The crossbars were introduced relatively early to keep the rails in place. Gradually, however, it was realized that the rails would be more efficient if they had an iron bar at the top.
It became a common practice, although iron caused greater wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, the wooden wheels gave way to the iron ones. In 1767 the first iron rails appeared.
The first means of transport that man knew were the legs. Humans began to walk in an upright position two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means "erect man").
Its predecessor, the Australopithecus, did not usually walk upright.
Signs of specialization for bipedal gait are present in Australopithecus fossils dating to 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
To try to mitigate to some extent the future suffering we can start to adopt more environmentally friendly lifestyles, we can join the environmental movement and also do activism.
In many cases this only works as a symptomatic treatment, but if we don’t just want a temporary solution, we should find the ultimate cause of the problems and turn it off.
It is quite evident that the world has changed a lot because of the scientific and technological advances of humanity, while the problems have increased because of the overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of human beings.
After Congress adopted it on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to John Dunlap's printing house a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were produced, now known as "The Dunlap Posters".
The document was first read publicly on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall, and the assignment was given to John Nixon.
One was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who had it read to his troops stationed in New York on 9 July, while a copy arrived in London on 10 August.
The 25 edged Dunlaps still known are the oldest extant copies of the document. The original manuscript has been lost.
According to many paleontologists today a category of dinosaurs has survived and is still alive. They are what we call birds.
Many tend not to consider them dinosaurs because of the feathers and their ability to fly.
Yet birds have many characteristics that are common to dinosaurs.
Like the T-Rex, they have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on two hind legs.
Ultimately, the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers is the basis of all computers currently in use.
A binary number can have only one of two values, 0 or 1, and in computer technical language these numbers are called binary digits or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Its symptoms, including vomiting, are very generic, so much so that an immediate diagnosis is impossible.
The main indication of indoor poisoning could be the presence in the house of an open container of drugs or harmful chemicals.
Check the label for first aid instructions for that specific poison.
The term mite is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from the familiarity in ancient times with bed bugs, insects that have strongly adapted to become parasites of man.
Both killer and bed bugs are nest-like, meaning they are adapted to live in their host's nest or home.
In the United States of America, multiple sclerosis (MS) has about 400,000 known cases, ranking first among neurological diseases affecting young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that the chances of developing MS among females are double that of males.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their interest, or that of their child.
These couples have the option of choosing an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the natural parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The primary goal of science is to understand the way the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides most scientific inquiry.
But it is not just about experimentation, since an experiment is a test that is used to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses; even asking questions and making observations allows you to guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, particularly the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's views on the various subjects of knowledge, including psychology, were accepted.
With the progressive decline of the Greek language, the West has been isolated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many have observed that physiological rhythms and behavior depend decisively on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just reactions to external periodic signals, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are independent oscillators, whose free cycle continues for a period of time even in the absence of external stimuli.
One of the first experiments to suggest that DNA was a genetic material was conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, i.e. viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments highlighting bacteriophage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or bacteriophage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a number of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the relevance of the piece of genetic material involved, and whether the affected cells belong to the germline.
Mutations that can be passed on to children are only those at the germ cell level; mutations that occur elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Naturalistic tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying the landscape, including the flora and fauna.
Examples of activities to do on site include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visits to parks and the study of information about the ecosystem.
For example by visiting, photographing and getting to know the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small country towns to drive to work, meeting other people whose place of work is the place they just started from.
In this dynamic comings and goings, everyone is somehow connected to a transportation system based on private cars, which at the same time they support.
Today science reveals that this massive carbon-based economy has forced the biosphere out of one of its stable conditions that has allowed human evolution over the past two million years.
Every person participates in social life and uses transport systems, about which almost everyone complains.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridges falling into disrepair.
Why do transport systems attract so many complaints, why are they rejected every day? Are the engineers who design them incompetent, or are there deeper motivations?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles from one point to another and the interactions they generate with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is complex since the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, driver behaviour tends to fall within a reasonably constant range, so traffic flows in turn tend to show reasonable constancy and can be represented generically in a mathematical way.
To obtain a more accurate representation of the traffic flow, the three main variables were correlated: (1) flow rate, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships are useful for planning, designing and managing road structures.
Insects were the first animals to take flight. The ability to fly allowed them to escape enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects benefit from the ability to fold their wings along the body.
This allows them to take advantage of a greater variety of small ravines to hide from predators.
Of all the insects that exist today, the only ones that are not able to fold their wings are dragonflies and ephemerals.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system moved around the Sun.
For some he was right, but many others believed the opposite, that the solar system, including the Sun itself (and other stars), moved around the Earth.
Which makes sense, because we don't have the feeling that the Earth is moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the largest and second longest river on Earth, carrying 8 times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, with a width that in some places reaches six miles.
About 20 percent of the world’s water comes from the Amazon River.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long, flowing into the waters of thousands of smaller tributaries.
They continued to build stone pyramids until the end of the Old Kingdom, but despite this the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in terms of size and technical excellence of their realization.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom remained enchanted admiring the monuments of their ancestors, which at that time were much more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the one with the smallest population.
The language of Vatican City for legislation and official communications is Italian.
Italian is also the everyday language spoken by most people working within the state, while Latin is often used in religious services.
In Vatican City all citizens are Roman Catholics.
Man began to know the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper already in antiquity: these elements can be discovered in nature in native form and it is possible to extract them quite simply with the help of primitive tools.
According to the philosopher Aristotle, everything is composed of a combination of one or more of the following four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
These in fact resemble more the four states of matter, that is (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma. However, he also theorized that they were transformed into new substances, forming what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Keep in mind that the periodic table contains numerous elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Obviously, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There may also be alloys composed of minimal amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
In the universe, everything is made of matter and all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are incredibly tiny, so much so that trillions of them could enter the spot at the end of this sentence.
After its invention, the pencil proved to be a good friend for many.
Unfortunately, with the introduction of new writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to a lower status and less and less widespread use.
Today everyone writes messages on computer screens and never has the need to approach a pencil sharpener.
We can only wonder what fate the keyboard will have when something new comes along.
The principle that energy is needed to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons underlies the operation of the fission bomb.
It's basically like rolling a heavy cart up a hill, so by further splitting the core, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they tend to break in the presence of little or no thrust.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust, and its outer layer is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the nearest side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker under the mountainous areas.
The maria could be more numerous on the near side because the crust is thinner. This facilitated the ascent of the lava to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what satisfies or attracts individuals.
According to these theories, people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they become adults.
These theories analyze what unites some people and pushes them to want to do what they do, and what are the factors of the context in which they live that push them to do or not do certain things.
Among the most popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
In general, when managers begin to direct their former colleagues, two behaviors may emerge. On the one hand there are those who try to remain "one of the boys" (or girls).
Managers of this type find it difficult to make unpopular decisions, implement disciplinary actions, evaluate performance, define and assign responsibilities.
At the opposite extreme, the manager turns into a completely different person, who feels that he has to change the entire work of the team and make it his own.
In the end, the leader is the person who is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This attitude often generates disagreements between leaders and the rest of the team.
The standard of excellence of virtual teams is similar to that of conventional teams, but with some small differences.
Members of the virtual team often have the function of point of contact for their next physical group.
They often have greater autonomy than members of conventional teams, as meetings can take place depending on the various time zones, which may not be understood by local management.
The existence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a fundamental element of a virtual team.
The invisible team is defined as the management team to which each member refers and is the one that sets the standards for each member.
Why should an organization have the will to face the long process that leads to the construction of a learning organization? A good reason to implement organizational learning concepts can be innovation.
When you are able to use all available resources effectively in all functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
Consequently, the path of collaboration within an organization to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet customer needs.
In order for an organization to define itself as innovative, it is necessary for leaders to create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) illustrates continuum theory as a method employed to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological results have demonstrated the physical existence of a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. The research area becomes narrower and therefore much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior is the basis of scientists’ research.
It has long been known that certain types of brain damage, trauma, injuries and tumors can affect behavior and change certain mental functions.
The introduction of new technologies allows us to see and investigate previously unobserved brain structures and processes.
This gives us a great deal of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand our mental processes.
Despite having a strong science fiction connotation, AI represents a very important branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
AI research includes building machines to automate operations that require intelligent behavior.
Some examples of application are control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as recognition of handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These things have become distinct disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real problems.
The AI system is today often used in the economic, medical, engineering and military fields, as well as being integrated into several software applications for home computers and video games.
Trips are a fundamental part of teaching. Often teachers would like to take their students to places that can not be reached by bus.
The solution is offered by technology with virtual tours. Students can see the artifacts of museums, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in class.
Sharing a virtual school trip is also a great excuse to share travel experiences and reflections with future classes.
For example, every year students at Bennet School, North Carolina, design a website about their trip to the capital; the website is redesigned every year, but previous versions are kept online and become an album.
Blogs can also help to improve students' writing. Often, in fact, their first experiences with blogs are characterized by poorly curated grammar and spelling, but in general the presence of an audience changes things.
Since students are usually the most critical audience, to avoid negative reviews the author of the blog undertakes to improve the writing.
Blogs also "force students to become more aware of the moment that surrounds them". The need to nurture the interest of the public motivates students to be ingenious and interesting (Toto, 2004).
The blog is a tool that aims to encourage collaboration and develop student learning well beyond the normal school day.
Proper use of blogs "can help students become more critical and analytical. By actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their own position within the writings of others, as well as outline their own perspectives on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the evocative and bilingual capital of Canada, full of art galleries and museums that tell the past and present of the country.
Further south are the Niagara Falls and to the north you can admire the natural and unspoiled beauty of the Muskoka region and much more.
All this and more makes Ontario typically Canadian according to the opinions of foreigners.
The large areas further north are sparsely populated, some of which are almost uninhabited wildlands.
If you compare the population, the result can be surprising to many: in the United States, the number of African-American citizens is higher than that of Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and its natural heritage makes it a continent in its own right.
Almost all of the smaller islands, known as luxury beach resorts, are mostly independent nations or associated with France.
In the lands the Arabs also brought Islam, which undertook a long journey to the Comoros and Mayotte.
In the 15th century, the discovery of the Cape route from Europe to India by Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama paved the way for European influence and colonialism.
To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, while to the south and west it borders the Atlantic Ocean.
For female travellers: it is recommended that all women declare that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences can lead to what they consider harassment, and that it is not unusual to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Have the firmness to reject men, and do not be afraid to oppose them (cultural differences or not, there is no justification!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC; with the name of Anfa, it was a port of strategic importance used by the Phoenicians, the Romans and the Merenids.
The Portuguese destroyed it to rebuild it with the name of Casa Branca, which they abandoned in 1755 following an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city that was called Daru l-Badya, then called Casablanca by the Spanish merchants who chose these places for their commercial bases.
In all of Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting cities for shopping.
In the vicinity of the old Medina it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as tagin, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs and a lot of hardware, but all this is reserved only for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town located in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, not far from Rwanda.
In 2002, lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma, burying much of the city's streets, especially those in the center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, it is appropriate to document well before carrying out any visits outside Goma, in order to assess well the state of the clashes that still persist in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as being one of the cheapest opportunities to see Africa’s mountain gorillas.
You can use a boda-boda (taxi-motorcycle) to move to Goma. The normal price (in local currency) is about 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Even as a result of its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuctu" ended up becoming a metaphor for exotic and distant land.
Today Timbuktu is a decayed city, but for its reputation it remains a tourist attraction, also equipped with an airport.
In 1990 it was included in the list of UNESCO heritage sites that are in danger, due to the threat posed by desert sands.
On Henry Louis Gates' PBS special "Wonders of the African World" it was one of the main stops.
With its more Arabic than African touch, the city stands out from the rest of the country.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and runs east along the border with Mozambique, north borders with Zimbabwe, and its southern border is represented by the Crocodile River.
Covering an area of 19,500 km2, the park comprises 14 different ecozones, each of which provides sustenance for a different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the most important of the South African national parks (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, there are daily fees for conservation and park entry.
Buying a Wild Card could also be useful, as it allows access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
The island of Hong Kong, which gives its name to the entire territory, is for many tourists the main destination.
The series of buildings that form the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a glittering bar graph, even more evident because it is framed by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To enjoy the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and visit the waterfront of Kowloon in front.
Most of Hong Kong Island’s urban development has focused on reclaimed land on the north coast, which is densely populated.
This is the place that the English colonizers chose for themselves, so if you’re looking for evidence of this land’s colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal strip of mangroves in the world. It extends 80 km (50 mi) from the coast in the hinterland of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The part of forest included in the Indian territory is named Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not only mangrove swamps: there is also what remains of the imposing jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about a third consists of swampy areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have become a wildlife sanctuary, with an estimated 400 Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses leave from the inter-district bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although many (especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang) leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since service buses between different districts are often full, it will be good to buy the ticket a few days in advance.
Most of the neighborhoods are reached by comfortable and sturdy small Japanese buses.
Shared taxis are a convenient and fast way to reach nearby locations, including Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a cable-stayed bridge that connects the city of Oiapoque, Brazil, to Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
Its two trusses have a height of 83 meters, is 378 meters long and has two lanes 3.50 meters wide.
Under the bridge the vertical free space is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but the opening to traffic took place only in March 2017.
In September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are likely to be completed, the bridge should be fully functional.
The Guaran<0xC3><0xAD> were the most important indigenous group living in present-day eastern Paraguay. They were semi-nomadic hunters and also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other indigenous tribes such as the Guaycuru and the Payaguá, who lived by hunting, gathering and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called "The Great Province of the Indies", was born in the 16th century from the encounter between the Spanish conquistadors and the native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period that lasted three centuries, the period of colonization.
Since the foundation of Asunci<0xC3><0xB3>n in 1537, Paraguay has been able to retain much of its indigenous identity and peculiarities.
Everyone knows that Argentina boasts one of the best teams and the best polo players in the world.
In December, in the polo fields of Las Ca<0xC3><0xB1>itas, the most important tournament of the year takes place.
Here you can attend minor tournaments and matches also at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and the purchase of tickets for polo matches, please contact the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The Falkland Islands have their official currency, the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), whose value is equivalent to that of the British pound (GBP).
The only bank in the islands, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store, offers currency exchange.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands. At Stanley you can often also pay with credit cards and US dollars.
It is likely that on the outlying islands do not accept credit cards, although British and US currencies can be accepted. Check in advance with the owners to decide on an acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so exchange your money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer when in the northern hemisphere it is winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical region; during the summer months temperatures above 30°C are quite normal.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely get below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity gives the sensation of a temperature lower than that marked by the thermometer.
There are no defined "dry" and "rainy" seasons: the amount of rain remains almost constant throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to human sight, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
The park authorities recommend keeping a distance of at least 100 yards/metres from bears and wolves and a distance of 25 yards/metres from all other wildlife.
No matter how docile they may seem: bison, elk, deer, bears, practically all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured for not maintaining an adequate distance. It is necessary to leave these animals an adequate space since they are large, wild and potentially dangerous animals.
Also keep in mind that odors can attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing with you or cooking foods with very strong odors, and try to keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of the Samoan islands. It is located on the island of Upolu and its population is just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded between 1850 and 1860 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In this port occurred the infamous naval stalemate of 1889, in which seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk, with the exception of a British cruiser, and nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful rally in the city led to the killing of Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, the supreme leader.
There are many beaches, since Auckland is located between two ports. The most popular are divided into three areas.
Beaches overlooking the Pacific Ocean on the North Shore (in the North Harbour District) extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
These are mainly sandy beaches, safe for swimming, and most of them enjoy the shade of pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive in Auckland Central, in the elegant suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, overlook Waitemata Harbour.
These beaches are suitable for families, sometimes a bit crowded, surrounded by a wide choice of shops. You can bathe safely.
The best known local beer is a non-complex, pleasant and refreshing beer called "Number One". The other local beer is called "Manta".
You can have a lot of French wines, but Australian and New Zealand wines could handle the journey better.
The local tap water is totally safe to drink, but if you are afraid, bottled water is easy to find.
According to Australians, the 'flat white' coffee is born from a foreign idea. The 'espresso' is short black coffee, the cappuccino is covered with cream (not foam) and the tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is at the same level as the Belgian one. The fruit juices are expensive, but very good.
Throughout the year there are many excursions on the reef and injuries to one of these causes on the reef are rare.
Always seek advice from authorities, follow directions and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
Cubomeduses appear from October to April near the beaches and estuaries of the rivers north of Seventeen Seventy. Outside this period they can be found only occasionally.
Sharks are present, but rarely attack humans. Most sharks fear them and tend to keep their distance.
The habitat of saltwater crocodiles consists mainly of the estuaries of the rivers north of Rockhampton, not actively living in the ocean.
By booking in advance, the traveler has the serenity to find a place to sleep once he reaches his destination.
Travel agencies often enter into agreements with certain hotels, but it is still possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through the same agencies.
Travel agencies generally offer packages including breakfast, transfers to/from the airport or even combined flight + hotel packages.
They can also keep the booking for you if you need time to think about the offer or to get additional documents needed for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or requests must be submitted first to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
On the occasion of some music festivals, most participants decide to camp on site, considering this aspect a crucial element of the experience.
To be close to the center of the action it is necessary to arrive early and get a space near the music.
Remember that once the music is over on the main stages, there may be sections of the festival where the music lasts until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, since the crossing of the ice causes quite annoying noises for those who are most exposed to it.
Cruises in St. Petersburg include the time to spend exploring the city. Cruise passengers are granted exemption from the visa requirement (check conditions).
Generally, casinos go to great lengths to increase the time and money spent by their guests as much as possible. Typically, there are no windows, no clocks, and exits can be hard to find.
They usually offer food, drinks and exclusive entertainment to keep the mood of the guests high making sure that they hold back.
In some places alcoholic beverages are offered by the house. However, the state of drunkenness alters the ability to judge and every good gambler knows how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone who decides to drive at high altitudes or on mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice or near-zero temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is reduced and you can’t drive like when you’re on clean asphalt.
During a snowstorm, so much snow can fall in a very short time that you get stuck.
Precipitation and snowflakes, or the formation of ice or condensation on vehicle windows, can also reduce visibility.
However, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic continues to flow almost continuously throughout the year.
Safaris are probably Africa’s biggest tourist attraction and the focus of many visitors’ vacation.
In its popular use, the term safari refers to trips taken overland, particularly in the savanna, to see the beautiful African wildlife.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get closer to cars, so normal equipment is enough to get a good view.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes fearful and for this reason you can observe them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk", "hiking safari", or "walking safari") is an excursion that can last a few hours or more days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2012, and part of the events will take place in other locations scattered throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games. The first Olympics were held in 1964.
If your booking for flights and accommodation for 2020 was made before the postponement was announced, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, however most coronavirus-related cancellation policies, as of the end of March 2020, do not arrive until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
The cost of most event tickets is expected to be between <0xC2><0xA5>2,500 and <0xC2><0xA5>130,000, while regular tickets will cost around <0xC2><0xA5>7,000.
Ironing wet clothes can make it easier to dry. Many hotels offer the use of iron and ironing board, even if they are not present in the room.
If you do not have an iron, or if you do not like to wear ironed socks, you can try with a hair dryer, if you have it available.
Be careful not to subject the fabrics to too high temperatures, to avoid shrinkage or, in the worst case, burns.
There are various ways to sanitize water, and some of these are more effective against specific risks.
In some areas it is enough to boil water for a minute, in others it takes many minutes.
The effectiveness of the filters is variable, so in case of doubt it is advisable to evaluate the purchase of packaged water inside sealed bottles from a reliable company.
Travelers can come into contact with animal parasites that are not widespread in their home regions.
Parasites can spoil food, cause irritation or, in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, as well as transmit poison or infections.
The same infectious diseases and dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force are not usually qualified as harmful animals.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy tax- and excise-free products in certain locations.
Travelers heading to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot, especially on products like alcohol and tobacco.
The Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most challenging driving conditions, as it often cuts through isolated areas of vegetation.
If you do not have the habit of driving on country roads, it is recommended to keep your eyes open, as steep slopes, narrow streets and narrow curves predominate.
The speed limits shown are significantly lower than those applied in the previous and subsequent sections (usually 35-40 mph / 56-64 km/h). Their strict observance is extremely important.
Strangely, though, the level of mobile phone service coverage in this area is much higher than in other sections of the route, for example in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German desserts are quite good and in Bavaria they are quite tasty and varied, similar to those of neighboring Austria further south.
Fruit cakes are a timeless classic, from those with apples available all year round to those with cherries and plums, which make their appearance during the summer.
Several German baking cakes also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. The most popular cakes often go very well with a strong cup of coffee.
Those who want to taste small but flavorful desserts can focus on those that, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish prepared with herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be both "dry" and "wet", depending on the amount of liquid contained.
In northern India and Pakistan, yoghurt is normally used for curry in the inland regions; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is more commonly used.
Given the presence of 17,000 islands to choose from, the term Indonesian cuisine is a generic term covering a wide variety of regional cuisines found in the country.
However, when used without further specification, the term generally denotes foods originating in the central and eastern part of the main island, Java.
The Javanese cuisine, now widely spread throughout the archipelago, offers a series of dishes of simple preparation; its predominant flavors are given by the use of peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially the Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The brackets are supports for the rider's feet and are hung on both sides of the saddle.
They provide greater stability to the rider but can present safety problems due to the possibility that the rider's feet are stuck in it.
If a jockey is thrown by a horse but has a foot stuck in the bracket, he could be dragged by the fleeing horse. To minimize this risk, there are some safety measures that can be taken.
For one thing, most riders wear riding boots that feature a heel and a smooth, rather thin sole.
Later some saddles, especially the English ones, inserted safety bars, which cause a leather bracket to detach from the saddle when, in the event of a fall, the rider pulls it back.
Cocham<0xC3><0xB3> Valley: the most important climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, where a large number of huge walls and granite cliffs are located.
The peaks of the peaks include breathtaking views. Climbers from all over the world are constantly tracing new paths on its walls, potentially endless.
Freestyle snow sports, such as skiing and snowboarding, are very popular and involve sliding on the snow thanks to the use of skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is one of the main tourist activities and boasts many enthusiasts, sometimes also called "ski bumps", who dedicate entire holiday periods to skiing in a particular area.
The principle behind skiing is very old: the first cave paintings depicting humans skiing date back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport has its origins at least in the seventeenth century; in 1861 the first recreational ski club in Australia was opened by the Norwegians.
Ski hiking: the activity is also called off-piste, ski mountaineering or skiing trekking.
It is related, although usually does not include them, to ski touring or skimo, which are practiced on steep terrain and require skis and boots much more rigid.
Think of the ski slope as a hiking-like route.
If the conditions are good, you will be able to cover somewhat greater distances than those covered by walking, but only very rarely will you reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on beaten tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent but made up of many independent countries. Normally, to travel through several countries you would have to apply for a visa and go through passport control several times.
However, in this respect, the Schengen area functions rather as a single country.
If you stay within this area, you can normally go from one border to another without having to go through passport checks again.
Similarly, if you are in possession of a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas for individual member countries, thus saving time, money and bureaucracy.
There is no universal definition of what makes an artifact a piece of antiques. Some tax agencies consider such an object to be at least 100 years old.
The definition has geographical differences with respect to the age limit that may be lower, as in the case of North America compared to Europe.
Artifacts could be defined as antiques, although newer than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer farming is an important source of livelihood for the Sámi and the culture on which this trade is based is also the basis of many other professions.
Even through the ages, not all Sámi have been involved in large-scale reindeer farming; some lived by fishing, hunting, and similar activities, using reindeer primarily as working animals.
Today many Sámi work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi territory.
Although widely used, particularly among non-Roma people, the word "gypsy" is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and a misperception of Roma people.
If a travel warning is issued for the destination you will be visiting, there may be consequences for your travel health insurance or insurance in the event of a trip cancellation.
You may also be interested in the opinions of governments other than your own, but keep in mind that such opinions are aimed at the citizens of those governments.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East might encounter different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The warnings are simply a brief summary of a country’s political situation.
The opinions reported are often superficial, generic and simplistic compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
"Adverse weather conditions" is the general term for any dangerous meteorological phenomenon that may cause damage, serious social distress or loss of life.
Extreme weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types, depending on geography, topography, and weather conditions.
Strong gusts of wind, hail, above-normal rainfall and uncontrolled fires are manifestations and consequences of adverse weather conditions, similar to thunderstorms, tornadoes, sea trumpets and cyclones.
Severe regional and seasonal weather events include storms, snowstorms, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Travelers are advised to inquire about the adverse weather conditions affecting their area, as they may affect travel planning.
Anyone planning to visit a country potentially considered as a war zone, must support vocational training.
Searching the Internet for 'Course on Hostile Environments' you are likely to find the address of a local business.
A course will normally cover all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually drawing on practical experience.
A course normally lasts 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing games, as well as many training activities on first aid and sometimes on weapons.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in the wild are widespread, while few publications deal with war zones.
Travellers planning sex reassignment surgery abroad should ensure that they have valid documents for the return journey.
The intention on the part of governments to issue passports without sex (X) information or updated documents to match a desired name and gender is variable.
Equally variable is the willingness of foreign governments to accept such documents.
Security inspections also became much more scrupulous in the post-9/11 era.
Transgender people in the pre-operative phase should not expect to pass the controls without their privacy and dignity being compromised.
Backwater currents are the return flow of waves crashing on the beach, often near a coral reef or similar formations.
Given the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in some deeper sections where a strong current can form towards the open sea.
Most deaths occur due to fatigue in an attempt to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, swimming again will not be more difficult than normal.
Try to locate an area where you are not likely to be trapped again, or consider whether to wait for rescues, based on your abilities and whether you have been spotted.
The return shock manifests itself in a shorter time than the culture shock (there being a shorter "honeymoon" phase), lasts longer and can be more serious.
Travellers who have found it easy to adapt to the new culture, sometimes have difficulty re-adapting to the culture of their home country.
Upon returning home from living abroad, you will have adapted to the new culture and lost some of the uses of your home culture.
In the first experience abroad, you are likely to have met people who are patient and understanding, aware that travelers to a new country need to adapt.
Many people did not imagine patience and awareness were necessary even for those who returned home.
The sound and light show of the pyramid is how much more interesting there is in the area for children.
Before the start of the show, you will be able to admire the pyramids immersed in darkness and silence.
Normally you always hear the noise made by tourists and vendors. The sound and light show is just like a book of stories.
The Sphinx becomes the background and the narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids and each pyramid is illuminated.
Claimed by various countries, the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, have the largest number of bases, including sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island is the largest and is home to the town of Villa Las Estrellas.
Among the other islands are Livingston Island and Deception; in the latter, the caldera of a still active volcano filled with water gives rise to a magnificent natural harbor.
The land of Ellsworth is the region that lies south of the peninsula and overlooks the sea of Bellingshausen.
Here the mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau, and then re-emerge and form the Ellsworth Mountains, a 360 km chain cut in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, known as the Sentinel Range, boasts the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which reaches 4,892 m with Mount Vinson.
In remote areas, without mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only possible alternative.
A satellite phone is not usually a substitute for a mobile phone, because to call you have to be outdoors with the view cleared to the satellite.
The service is often used by pleasure craft, including pleasure craft, as well as missions that require remote voice and data.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
One of the increasingly popular options among those planning to take a gap year is to travel and learn.
It is particularly prevalent among recent graduates, since they can take a year off before starting university without compromising their education.
In many cases enrolling in a course abroad in the gap year can actually increase your chances of resuming higher education upon returning to your home country.
Enrollment in these educational programs usually requires payment of a fee.
Finland is the ideal destination for those who love to sail. In the "Land of a Thousand Lakes" there are also thousands of islands, within the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don’t necessarily need a yacht for archipelagos and lakes.
Although the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are certainly large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is the national pastime of Finland, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is also the case in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but in general it is rather unusual (e.g. in the Netherlands the ratio is one to forty).
Much of the different Baltic cruises include a multi-day stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic town for two whole days, returning to the ship in the evening to sleep.
You will not need a separate visa (starting in 2009) to go ashore using on-board excursions.
Some brochures also offer cruises in Berlin, Germany. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not located near the sea, moreover the visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can scare people of all ages and any condition, especially if they have never flown before or have had some traumatic experience.
There is nothing to be ashamed of: it is not unlike the personal fears and aversions that many people manifest towards other things.
For some people, understanding a little bit about how planes work and what happens during a flight can be helpful in overcoming a fear based on the unknown, or not being in control.
Couriers are well paid to deliver products quickly. Often the timing is very important in the case of company documents, goods or spare parts for an urgent repair.
For some routes larger companies use their own planes, but for other routes and in the case of smaller companies problems emerged.
On some routes, air shipments would have required days for unloading and customs clearance.
The only way to get it there faster would be to ship it as checked baggage. And this is where you come into play, since airline regulations do not allow you to ship baggage without a passenger.
To fly first class or business class the most obvious way is to shell out a nice amount for the privilege (or, even better, convince your company to do so).
However, the price to pay is high: indicatively, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business trips and up to eleven times the fare for those in first class!
In general, on direct flights from A to B it is not even worth looking for discounts on first class or business class seats.
Airlines know well that there is a category of travelers willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of arriving quickly and comfortably at their destination, and as a result they apply certain rates.
The capital of Moldova is Chi<0xC5><0x9F>in<0xC4><0x83>u and the local language is Romanian. However, Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has been the scene of ethnic conflict in the past.
In 1994, the conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in the eastern part of Moldova, with its own government and currency, but not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic relations between these two areas of Moldova have been restored.
The predominant religion in Moldova is Christian Orthodox.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of about 3.7 million inhabitants; it is the second largest port after Istanbul and an important crossroads for transport.
The ancient city of Izmir spreads over a huge bay, is surrounded by mountains and currently constitutes a modern, evolved and active commercial center.
Although the atmosphere in the city is more like that of Mediterranean Europe than that of traditional Turkey, the wide avenues, glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping malls are dotted with characteristic red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century market, and ancient mosques and churches.
In the village of Haldarsvik you can enjoy beautiful views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and you can visit a unique octagonal church.
In the churchyard, on some of the tombs, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves.
A half hour is enough to walk around the charming village.
To the north is the romantic and enchanting city of Sintra, easily accessible. It became famous in the eyes of foreigners thanks to the brilliant story of its splendors written by Lord Byron.
The bus line Scotturb 403 regularly connects with Sintra, and stops at Cabo da Roca.
Also to the north, visit the great shrine of Our Lady of Fatima (place of worship), a place of Marian apparitions famous throughout the world.
Remember that the site you are visiting is basically a mass grave, and has almost incalculable significance for a significant portion of the world’s population.
There are still many men and women who survived these places, and many others who saw their loved ones murdered or made to work to death, both Jews and non-Jews.
Treat the place with all the dignity, seriousness and respect it deserves. Avoid jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Avoid disfiguring these places by smearing the structures with signs or graffiti.
In the city of Barcelona the official languages are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, the vast majority is able to understand it; Spanish is known by practically everyone.
However, most signs are written exclusively in Catalan, which is by law the first official language.
Spanish, however, is also widely used for public transport and other services.
On the metro, ordinary announcements are only in Catalan. Any unscheduled service interruptions are communicated in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese, thanks to an automatic system.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, impolite and conceited.
Although it is often just an imprecise stereotype, the best way to feel good in Paris continues to be to behave at your best, relating as a person "bien élevé" (well educated). This will definitely facilitate your movements.
Parisians’ rude outward appearance will fade quickly if you flaunt some basic good manners.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is rich in forests, mostly beech, spruce and fir, and is characterized by a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to a multiplicity of microclimates, soils and different altitude levels it presents a great variety of plant communities.
The area is also home to a wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare species such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wild cat and the cedar rooster live in these places, along with several other more widespread animal species.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover the knees and cover the shoulders.
Most monasteries provide stoles for women who arrive unprepared, but if you already have one, especially if in bright colors, you will earn a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear long pants below the knees.
These can also be borrowed from the warehouse at the entrance; however, the garments are not washed after each user, so wearing these skirts you may not feel comfortable. For men, a one size fits all!
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (mainly pork) and uses olive oil everywhere.
The Pa amb Oli is a simple popular dinner, typical of the summer season: bread with olive oil, tomato and all the condiments available, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, in addition to the pronoun "Sie" used for the form of courtesy that stands for "She", always begin with a capital letter, even if they appear in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important mechanism for distinguishing certain verbs and complements.
This aspect probably also facilitates reading, although the need to understand whether a verb or an adjective is used in a noun form makes writing rather complex.
Italian pronunciation is relatively simple since most words are pronounced as they are written.
The main letters to pay attention to are the c and the g, since their pronunciation changes according to the vowel that follows.
Also be sure to pronounce "r" and "rr" differently: dear means beloved, while chariot means carriage.
Persian has a relatively simple and most often regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this basic grammar manual could help you a lot with Persian grammar and sentence comprehension.
It goes without saying that if you already know a Romance language, learning Portuguese will be easier.
However, people with a minimal knowledge of the Spanish language may come to the hasty conclusion that Portuguese is quite similar and therefore should not be studied separately.
Nowadays, pre-modern observatories are usually obsolete and serve as museums or educational venues.
Since light pollution in their heyday was not a problem as it is today, they are usually placed in cities or campuses, more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge structures in remote areas where atmospheric conditions are favorable.
Admiration of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where the flowering of plums was preferred.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were organized by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy close to the imperial court.
Plants give their best when they are in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to take even "only" one specimen.
If you visit an Italian garden, even collecting some specimens of plants will cost you the distance from this place, without discussion.
In general, Singapore is a very safe and easy city to tour; you can buy pretty much anything once you arrive.
But being in the "high tropics", only a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to deal with the heat (always) and the strong sun (more rarely, when the sky is clear).
Some buses also travel north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the Bible patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Make sure the bus you wish to take reaches the interior of Hebron and does not stop at the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a great theme to organize a vacation around.
For example you can visit the castles in the Loire Valley and the Rhine Valley, you can take a cruise to visit the interesting cities of the Danube or you can sail on the Erie Canal.
In addition, they define the routes of hiking trails and well-known bike paths.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity and celebrates the birth of Jesus.
Most of the traditions related to this holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
A tradition is to spend Easter night staying awake in an open-air place to watch the sunrise.
There are of course Christian theological explanations behind this tradition, but it could very well be a pre-Christian ritual linked to spring and fertility.
In more traditional churches, an Easter Vigil is frequently celebrated on Saturday night of Easter weekend, with congregations often beginning the ceremony at the stroke of midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally came to the islands came swimming, flying or floating.
Since the distance from the mainland was considerable, mammals could not face the journey. This made the giant tortoise become the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Numerous mammals such as goats, horses, cows, rats, dogs and cats were introduced to the Galapagos after the arrival of man.
If you visit the territories of the Arctic or the Antarctic during the winter, you will be able to experience the polar night, when the sun remains below the horizon.
This phenomenon offers the possibility of witnessing the aurora borealis, because the sky remains dark almost all day.
Since the territories are sparsely populated, light pollution is often not a problem and you can also enjoy the stars.
In Japan, the work culture is more hierarchical and formal than that to which Westerners tend to be accustomed.
Office clothing normally consists of a jacket and tie or suit and is addressed to colleagues by surname or professional title.
The harmony of the workplace is of crucial importance, as it gives importance to the commitment of the group rather than praising individual achievements.
Workers are often required to receive the consent of their superiors regarding every decision, and are expected to follow instructions without question.
