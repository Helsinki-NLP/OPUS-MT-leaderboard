At the end of the trade, the Prague Stock Exchange turned negative
After Tuesday morning’s crash, the Prague Stock Exchange rectified its losses.
Transactions with <0xC4><0x8C>EZ shares reached almost half of the usual daily exchanges.
On Tuesday, from the beginning of the exchanges, the Prague Stock Exchange resumed its fall from the previous day, when it lost almost six percent.
This time, the decline is due to the fall in stocks on Wall Street.
The reaction of the market to the result of the vote of the US House of Representatives, which refused to adopt the plan to stabilize the US financial sector, is thus also noticeable here.
Shares fall in Asia
Asian stock markets experienced a dramatic drop on Tuesday, although the indices managed, during the day, to erase some of the losses.
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange’s Hang Seng Index lost four percent during trading, but later it erased some of the losses and reduced the decline to nearly 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index following the movement of Chinese equities from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange lost 3.8 percent, with markets closed in Shanghai.
The shares of the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but eventually the losses were reduced to 4.3 percent.
According to its index, the Taiwan Stock Exchange lost 3.6 percent.
"Hesitation about the U.S. bailout will affect financial markets around the world," said Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.
Although Hong Kong is part of China, it sets its own monetary policy, i.e. independently of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as in the United States.
Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said U.S. lawmakers should quickly resume negotiations and adopt the proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, there would be a risk that other countries would suffer the consequences.
The bloodbath of American actions
On Monday, the US House of Representatives rejected the proposed financial system support, to which it should have devoted up to $700 billion (nearly K<0xC4><0x8D>12 billion).
The legislators thus reject the call for support of President George Bush's project.
According to Bush, the project should solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks went through a bloodbath on Monday, and major stock indexes fell the most in 20 years.
The Dow Jones index lost nearly seven percent, having experienced a drop of such magnitude for the last time in 1987.
The index was already losing during the vote, but when it appeared that the proposal was not adopted, it was in free fall.
Congress caved: U.S. government can pump $700 billion into banks
U.S. Congressional leaders and President George W. Bush’s administration have agreed on a broader form of financial aid deal for the U.S. financial system.
It will be put to the vote early next week.
U.S. lawmakers made a decisive turning point in the talks over the adoption of a bailout in the form of $700 billion (about 12 trillion kroner) in financial aid to the U.S. financial system.
However, success is not certain.
Indeed, before they can publish the final version of the law and put it to the vote, Congressmen must complete a number of details of the agreement.
The plan to support the financial system will be discussed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
Barney Frank, the chairman of the House Banking and Financial Regulation Committee, told Reuters on Sunday.
According to sources, on Wednesday at the earliest, the plan should a priori be put to the vote in the Senate.
According to economists, the announcement that the rescue plan will be adopted should be a first major psychological factor to revive the financial markets.
However, given the complexity of the mechanisms through which market aid can be effective, a "disillusionment" will follow.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We have made great progress.
We have settled our differing opinions on what form the market stabilization package should take," Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could be held as early as Sunday.
On the night of Saturday to Sunday, representatives of the legislators met with the American Minister of Finance Henry Paulson, in order to give the substance of the government a final form.
It should buy back from financial firms the unsaleable real estate assets that are driving financial firms into considerable losses and threatening the stability of the system as a whole.
"We are about to agree on a plan that will work and that must also be effective in the market.
We still need to continue with this market recovery plan, but I think we're there," Paulson said.
A signal for Asian trade
The global financial crisis is having a significant impact on falling equity markets.
According to Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are ensuring that Congress will reach a final agreement by Sunday.
They want to calm investors before the start of trading in Asian financial markets, which are located in the first time zone, where the Congress decision could affect Monday's trade.
However, for the moment, it is impossible to say with certainty when the two houses of Congress will proceed to the vote, or if the negotiations will not risk being blocked, at the last moment, by this or that problem.
The legislators hope that it will be adopted in the coming days.
Nevertheless, the law will undergo many changes.
The total amount intended to be used by the system must be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion, as President George Bush wanted, must be made available as soon as possible.
But, if Congress feels that the program is not fulfilling its function, it has the option of blocking the remaining amount, by following two steps: first an additional $100 billion, and then, finally, $350 billion.
President Bush Welcomes Progress in Negotiations
Although the president can veto this decision, Congress has the opportunity to put him in the minority.
Despite these changes, the main idea of the program, which was to obtain financing for the purchase of bad real estate securities, whose value fell, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are not able to pay their mortgages, was maintained.
"All the work is done.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
U.S. President George Bush himself is pleased with the progress in the negotiations.
Spokesman Tony Fratto said Bush was pleased with Saturday's progress and appreciated "the bipartisan effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy."
Limitation of golden parachutes
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, Chief Negotiator, says lawmakers have agreed on the responsibility of the financial program, the protection of contributors from losses, the settlement of rebates, and the timeline.
The new law also provides for the limitation of the said golden parachutes for the directors of the companies participating in the program and it establishes a committee, which will ensure the supervision of the fund.
The latter should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We have worked very hard on the issue and have made significant progress toward an agreement that will work and be effective for the market and for all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also provides help for property owners, who have trouble paying.
The government should negotiate new down payments in the case of mortgages that it will buy, while reducing the monthly payments of debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological help
According to Patria Finance chief economist David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but its realization is going to be very difficult.
"And this is due to the fact that we do not know what the mechanism and the price of the purchase of problem assets will be.
This point will be decisive in deciding on the sharing of losses between the financial sector and the government," Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan will be adopted now, or early next week, is, according to Marek, not that important.
“It’s much more important that congressmen agree this week that they support this plan and that we commit to it as soon as possible.
This psychological significance of the agreement, providing for the adoption of the plan, matters most at the moment," Marek stressed.
A fight pushed to the extreme: MP3 players against mobiles.
We will advise you, how to choose
While virtually all mobile phones can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make phone calls.
It seems clear that it is better to buy only a phone.
However, there are plenty of reasons to get an independent reader.
The choice depends entirely on the mode of use and the requirements of the future owner.
It would be absurd to buy for the house an expensive high-end gramophone to put the new album of Maxim Turbulenc.
On the one hand, such musical products do not come out on vinyl, and, from the point of view of quality, there is no objective reason for this to happen.
Now, if there are piled up vinyl records on your shelves, with art rock, jazz or blues, you probably dream of such a gramophone.
The same is true of music during travel, namely compressed music, to put it in a simplified way - music in MP3.
Here too, there are categories based on price and quality.
For one, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for a reader, in the same way that a Pink Floyd fan would struggle to bear headphones bought for twenty crowns at the market.
These are two extremes, between which there is enough room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
Battery life is also crucial.
Some high-end music players are capable of much more than just playing music, but these are unknown functions, of course, of most mobiles.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to the basic functions, phone calls and sending SMS, it is able to play music and movies, record them, has a camera of variable quality and can, for example, even be used for navigation.
And if we take into account smartphones and communicators, you will have in your pocket a small computer.
Since no refrigerator can grill meat and no television will take photographs, we are witnessing a miracle.
However, the universal character of the mobile is not without its drawbacks.
The larger the number of functions you use, the smaller the interval between reloads.
And playing music is one of the most important energy goofs.
There are few mobiles that are able to play music for ten to twelve hours, in most cases, this figure is significantly lower.
In this respect, music players (especially the most rudimentary) are much more efficient.
In the case of cheap mobiles, expect that they will only play music for a few hours.
If, in addition, you happen to call from time to time, get, to be sure, a second recharge for work - this is valid even for more expensive devices.
The problem will not arise for MP3 players, which are capable, as a result of recharging, of a continuous operation of at least 9 hours, including the least efficient.
Another problem occurs when recording music in the mobile.
Unfortunately, a limited number of devices have a universal USB connector, especially since not all can be directly connected to the computer, without special software.
One can, of course, record music directly to the memory card, but few card readers know how to do it without reduction, given the tiny dimensions of the memory cards used in mobiles.
As for the players, you do not need, except for (iPod), any software.
Simply fill, through the USB connector, the music device from the computer.
Most mobiles and readers will create a media library themselves, classified by the performer's name, album title, style, or user judgment.
Some devices only display an index with a tree structure, like Windows Explorer, others are capable of both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
Readers are easier to manipulate, mobiles have more know-how
When choosing a specific device, focus on the battery life, the memory capacity, the quality and type of sound output and, of course, the ease of control.
If the music is for you, essentially, a background noise and if in the day you are going to listen to it only for a limited time, for example by taking the tram, you just need any mobile reading the MP3.
Virtually every mobile phone is capable of this.
You don’t even have to pay too much attention to the formats of music that the mobile or the player is able to read.
Everyone can play MP3s and the vast majority of the music that will reach you will have just that format.
It is one of the most popular formats and apart from it, the vast majority of devices can also play WMA format music.
The AAC (format used by Apple and its iPods), meanwhile, is less common.
High-end mobiles also allow, for example, the purchase of music online.
Just visit, from the mobile phone, the corresponding web pages of the operator (or those of another provider) and buy the song or album in question.
This service alone should be a compelling reason to get a music mobile.
The offer of operators is unfortunately miserable and it is limited, in most cases, to quickly made radio tubes.
The prices are not the lowest either.
Nevertheless, it is generally considered that this way of buying music (whether by GSM, internet, or even wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry their mobile phone around.
Whenever you feel like listening to something, you just have to take the mobile out of your pocket, while you have forgotten your MP3 player at home.
However, it is also important if you always have headphones or a handsfree with connection.
If this is not the case, you can use the built-in speakers, which practically all mobiles have, but a minimum of MP3 players.
For many, the main advantage of music mobiles is their price.
The cheapest ones normally cost less than three thousand.
For a price of three thousand four thousand crowns, one can have a walkman already very suitable.
However, in most cases, you will be limited by the lack of output for ordinary headphones.
The price of the best phones and the best tools, also provided with an input for ordinary headphones, does not exceed fifteen thousand.
Readers, on the other hand, have the advantage of having an easy command.
Really anyone can secure the order of the most rudimentary readers - which do not necessarily correspond to the cheapest (cf. our choice).
A minimum of functions; and the resemblance of the command to that of a cassette station, commonly used in the past, or a gramophone, is obvious.
There is no risk of collision in the form of a mobile internet connected by chance, followed by a huge data transmission bill.
Which device to choose
Even the cheapest mobiles (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have an exchangeable memory card slot (type M2, microSD, and so on).
Even taking into account the additional purchase of such a card, you will not exceed two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
In principle, the basic models only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive come out even with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already own a mobile and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a Cowon, a Creative, a Sony, a Samsung, an Emgeton, or an iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you should not spend more than 1,100 kroner.
If you are among the most demanding listeners, choose specialized mobile-walkman instead (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices are provided with independent control keys for MP3, and this is how the ease of control comes close to that of an independent MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose Walkman series phones have the same user menu as separately sold MP3 players, is the one that has gone the furthest in this area.
The same service, in the same price category, but with a memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and a longer battery life (normally 15 hours, up to 35 hours), is provided by an MP3 player produced by one of the brands mentioned above.
A first virtual operator will win the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe...
The Czech mobile market is relatively advanced, with our operators offering virtually the same services as their partners in Western Europe.
Despite this, we still lack something - a virtual operator, which would force conventional operators to lower prices.
It may not be missing for a long time.
We have already mentioned on Mobil.cz many times that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
<0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> (Czech Telecommunications Office), which reported that the price of an SMS was higher in our country than in the rest of the Union, confirmed this.
Thus, following the latest steps taken by the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming charges, a paradoxical situation is likely to occur - SMS sent from abroad will be for some customers of Czech mobile operators cheaper than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high, compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that would really like to get into the fight.
This may seem paradoxical, given that we still have three mobile networks and a penetration that far exceeds 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this, Pavel Dvo<0xC5><0x99>ák, the President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (<0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>), who has repeatedly stated that in the Czech Republic there is no more room for another operator, spoke with the operators.
It is probably true that a conventional operator with its own network is apparently not very lucky anymore (by the way, now it would hardly find frequencies).
However, there is still a possibility - a virtual operator.
It is precisely the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that has led to a considerable fall in prices, to which conventional operators must also react.
Yet, even before trouble-makers such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile entered the market, voices similar to those heard in our country today were being heard in Britain.
However, it appeared that there was still room for such operators and that they could be a real success.
We don’t have to go too far to find examples.
In February we informed you about the launch, in Poland, of the virtual operator Mobilking.
In just six months, this operator has managed to gain more than 100 thousand customers and become the fifth operator in the country.
In addition, behind Mobilking, there is the financial group Penta, which owns, among other things, U:fon in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more concrete target group.
For their operation to be efficient, they need much fewer customers than a conventional operator.
They are, in fact, exempt from the relatively high costs of building, operating and maintaining the mobile network.
Thus, in the world, virtual operators are emerging as low-cost operators - they offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often offset by a limited service offer.
For example, Tesco Mobile offers SMS at least twice as cheap as its competitors in the UK.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, betting on an unusual target group can also be a good publicity stunt.
Indeed, this operator specifically targets men.
“Real men choose Mobilking – an operator they like and can trust,” says David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, operating this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether such a concept would be likely to work in our country as well.
Vodafone spokesman Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> said: “The Czech market is relatively small for a segmental approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
Especially since it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the offer of services."
In the Czech Republic, no chance, say mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if there will be a virtual operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are discussing the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations are not very encouraging.
The launch of Mobilking will instead take place in other countries in our area," Jana Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ková, a spokeswoman for the financial group Penta, told Mobil.cz in a telephone interview.
It thus indirectly confirmed that the operators in the Czech Republic were, in any case, not in favour of this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything possible so that a potential competitor can not appear.
The GTS Novera group, which would like to take a new step to become a real competitor of Telefonika in the field of corporate customers, has not hidden, for quite a long time, its intention to launch a virtual mobile operator.
"We want to be able to offer our customers not only fixed but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner the better.
We have already conducted negotiations on this possibility on several occasions with all Czech mobile operators.
With some, we managed to move forward in the negotiations," said group spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
So the future may be promising.
From unofficial information, it seems that we may be able to host the first virtual operator already by the end of the year.
But for now, its creation is accompanied by total silence.
“At the moment, we do not believe that there is room in the Czech market for a virtual operator as such.
The Czech market is in comparison with others very specific.
At the moment, no subject with a complex and serious project in this area has contacted us," said Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88> of the press department of Telefonika O2, in his statement for Mobil.cz.
Other operators also refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová says in a rare agreement with O2’s statement: “We have not yet registered a viable and bilaterally advantageous project, which could serve as a basis.”
“It is virtually impossible for a virtual carrier to appear on the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
To operate in such a limited time frame, we should have a concrete agreement now."
Instead, Vodafone is focusing on fulfilling requests to obtain its own 3G license.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> said: “We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and especially in the area of shared costs and infrastructure.
This, in our opinion, means the most contributions from the point of view of the customers.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is to find a partner to set up a common network for a fast mobile internet.”
Responsible authorities: in line with operators
The approach of mobile operators is easily understandable, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would have led to a decrease in prices and therefore a decrease in their profit.
What good is it to facilitate the advent of such a competitor?
When it comes to their interests, the operators know how to get along like thieves at a fair. The chicane accompanying the creation of the U:fon is also proof of this.
The biggest apparent pressure on the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, when the U:fon was created, was that exerted by the company T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by publicly available information from the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> web pages.
Today, however, the U:fon lends itself as an argument for not accepting a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová commented: “Competition in the mobile market has also recently been amplified by the market entry of a fourth mobile operator.
Given the character of the mobile market in RT, it is obvious that the entry of an additional player would subject him, and especially his services, to high demands.
But given the attitude of the mobile operators here, the indifference of the Czech regulatory bodies seems disconcerting.
However, it is not only about the attitude of <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, which, unlike Great Britain and other developed countries, unfortunately does not have the power to intervene in economic competition in the Czech Republic.
It belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (<0xC3><0x9A>OHS).
However, the latter adopted, in the face of this problem, its typical position.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible following the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the virtual operator in question concerning the leasing of the necessary infrastructure.
No agreement of this type has been concluded at the moment, because the offer of potential interested parties has not a priori presented enough interest for conventional operators, "said Kristián Chalupa of the Department of External Relations of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS in response to our question.
Such a statement would not come as a surprise to representatives of operators.
But on the part of an office, which must represent the interests of consumers and among other things also take care that no one takes advantage of its position in the market, such a statement is more than confusing.
Especially since Kristián Chalupa adds: "Foreigner, where virtual operators are normally present, it can be seen that their entry into the market has contributed to a drop in the prices of mobile phone services."
However, pushing for an honest functioning of the market and a fall in prices is apparently not in the interests of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
What is actually shocking is the almost touching concord of the three mobile operators, which stems from their reactions.
The question, whether this is really a coincidence, arises quite naturally.
In the same way, a gasoline price strictly identical to all service stations is probably due to the chance and the hard fight of the competition.
"The Office has not found any signs of anti-competitive behaviour in this regard, so it has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position and therefore none of them has a corresponding increased responsibility for its conduct on the market.
The tools needed to open up the mobile market to virtual operators are probably lacking even in the telecoms regulator," Chaloupa said in his statement.
The interpretation of market dominance is one of many points of contention.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, according to which telecommunications constitute, from the point of view of economic competition, a single market.
None of the Czech operators has a dominant position in such a market.
However, some legal experts propose another view: for the creation of a virtual operator to be possible, it is necessary to obtain, each time, the consent of the network operator.
And the mobile operator has quite logically the monopoly on its network.
Thus, it necessarily plays a dominant role in a certain segment of its activity.
Now, even without admitting this argument, it should be at least worrying for the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS that three mobile operators visibly proceed in a similar manner.
However, the complaints of many interested parties (including GTS Novera, already mentioned) show that they face similar constraints in negotiations with all operators.
Taking responsibility back on the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> is a fairly common turn in communications, by means of which the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS washes its hands of the matter.
We have already encountered this type of attitude in several similar cases.
Regrettably, the recently adopted Telecommunications Act did not succeed in extending the powers of the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> in the area of economic competition in telecommunications, although many experts promised an improvement in the situation.
The representatives of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS must know this very well, but their interests apparently lie elsewhere.
When no one's looking, it can work
That said, the operation of a kind of pseudo-virtual operators, several in Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
These are companies that publish their own price lists for mobile telephone services, but these are only partially public.
In most cases, it is a question of firms dealing with multi-level marketing.
Special mobile telephone services are offered, for example, by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The price lists of these firms usually reach only elected officials.
The magic trick consists in the fact that the company does in front of the operator figure of a classic company customer, who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, she gets special (and other) price offers.
What is problematic is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such resale.
"If what you are talking about happens, it could be a transgression of the contractual conditions that we would examine and that could lead to a stop of the collaboration with the company in question," Martina Kemrová answered our question on this problem.
Nevertheless, it is rather unlikely that an echo of such activity has not reached the heads of mobile operators.
Especially in the case of the three companies mentioned it can be thousands of customers.
No operator, however, is against such a procedure.
Indeed, the activities of these firms bring them non-negligible benefits, and, at the same time, as opposed to real virtual operators, they do not threaten them with their own official marketing.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> points out the possible problems: "The law allows such speculation, however, the services of these companies are only used by a negligible percentage of customers.
In addition, they are forced to admit that the SIM card in their phone is not registered under their name, so they can not fully dispose of it, in the way of ordinary customers of mobile operators.
This is precisely what should seem strange to the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>.
In addition, there is another question at the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
If mobile operators turn a blind eye to such a procedure, why are they blocking the creation of a virtual operator?
It should be added that the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS has relatively broad powers to disclose such activity, and if it does not wish to be satisfied with the explanations of the operators, who claim to have no idea that this would happen, their contractual conditions prohibit it.
When we're no longer the most expensive country
As we have already mentioned on several occasions, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has led to a considerable drop in the price of services.
However, in virtually all countries where virtual operators appeared, the traditional operators were trying more or less to prevent their creation.
The arguments used by the latter were practically the same - a market too small, if not too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
However, it is precisely at this level that the regulatory bodies intervened in the developed countries, which defended not the interests of mobile operators, but those of their customers.
Both through formal measures and informal pressure, they ended up with the creation of a first virtual operator, followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies treat this issue in the manner of a hot potato that is disposed of by passing it on to a nearby target.
Following the experiences we have, we can not get rid of the impression that the confusion in the skills is in these cases more than profitable.
But let's not throw in the towel after the axe.
If the behind-the-scenes information is true and a virtual operator will soon appear here, the Czech mobile market may get moving again.
If one of the operators has accepted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, it will be difficult for the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS to remain impassive in the face of the rejection (discrimination) of other interested parties.
And perhaps we will stop calling more expensively than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four achievements of the new version of the Czech national anthem.
On the occasion of Czech Nationality Day on Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek solemnly presented the new recordings of the national anthem Kde domov m<0xC5><0xAF>j (Where is my homeland?).
The anthem was again recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlávek.
We have four versions - with a male or female solo song, a choir performance and an instrumental version.
Singing is provided by Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>nková and Adam Plachetka.
Otakar Jeremiá<0xC5><0xA1> and Jaroslav Kr<0xC4><0x8D>ek are the authors of the arrangements of the anthem.
You can listen to the four new versions on the iHNed.cz server.
B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlávek considers the Czech national song as one of the most beautiful hymns.
As he had previously entrusted to <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> rozhlas (Czech public radio), he chose for the interpretation of the solo versions of the singers with young and representative voices, which are marked and appreciated.
"From the beginning, I tried to make sure that both singers, as well as the choir, have a good diction, so that we understand the lyrics, that they sing simultaneously," he said.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov m<0xC5><0xAF>j was first sung in 1834 on the stage of Stavovské divadlo (Theatre of States) in Fidlova<0xC4><0x8D>ka (Kermesse des savetiers), the Czech original by Josef Kajetán Tyl, accompanied by the music of Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek <0xC5><0xA0>kroup.
It became popular and people spontaneously appropriated it.
After the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first verse naturally became part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.

Prague’s public transport (MHD) will introduce, on Wednesday, the chip in their ticketing system
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be recorded in the history of the Pra<0xC5><0xBE>sk<0xC3><0xBD> Dopravn<0xC3><0xAD> podnik (Prague Transport Agency) as the date when the first passengers will board the metro, trams and buses, who, instead of having a paper ticket, will have an electronic coupon in their pocket.
At the moment, the latter is accessible to about a hundred thousand people, owners of the Opencard smart card.
Passengers can purchase a 30-day or 90-day voucher (this will be valid from 1 January 2009) and simultaneously have it registered on their smart card at the information points and offices of the Dopravn<0xC3><0xAD> podnik (Transport Agency), located in the metro stations Muzeum, M<0xC5><0xAF>stek, Nádra<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD> Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice, And<0xC4><0x9B>lyl, Ro<0xC5><0x9B>l.
Starting from yesterday, there is also the possibility to buy the coupons by internet on the web pages of the Dopravn<0xC3><0xAD> podnik: www.dpp.cz.
More than four hundred people enjoyed the service during the morning.
Those who will start using the online store can permanently forget about the counters in metro stations, where they had until now to stomp impatiently in long queues in order to get paper tickets.
Indeed, they will buy their coupon online and it will be registered on their Opencard card in one of the thirteen M<0xC4><0x9B>stská knihovna (municipal libraries).
"In these points of contact, there is a ticket office with trained staff available to passengers, who will help those interested with the purchase over the internet and, in addition, will register the coupon they have purchased on their card," says project spokesman Martin Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD>.
Next to the libraries, it will also be possible to register the electronic coupons on the Opencard in vending machines installed in the vestibule of several metro stations.
What do these distributors look like?
They are red, reminiscent of composting machines tickets and passengers may have already noticed them in metro stations Roztyly, Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Today the city has five, but by the end of the year there should be eighty," Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD> added.
An automaton will check the coupon instead of the driver
The machines that will be running from tomorrow are easy to use.
Simply enter the Opencard smart card and the previously purchased coupon will register itself on the card.
The electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the vicinity of the city.
Namely in peri-urban trains and bus lines 300 to 499, which are mainly used by the inhabitants of the municipalities of central Bohemia to access the capital.
"In the integrated trains in Pra<0xC5><0xBE>ská integrovaná doprava (Prague's integrated transport), the controllers are equipped with card readers, with the help of which they establish the temporary and zonal validity of the coupons;" explained ticket control Filip Drápal of the organization Ropid, which designs the schedules of the Prague public transport.
Peri-urban buses are equipped with card readers integrated into the driver’s box.
When boarding it is therefore necessary not only to show the smart card to the driver, but also to place the Opencard at the place indicated on the side of the cashier.
This is how the driver checks the validity of the registered coupons.
"In case the passenger needs to check the validity of the registered coupons, there is nothing simpler than asking the driver for this information," Drápal added.
Passengers who do not take the peri-urban buses and will not remember the date on which the validity of their coupon expires, can return to the vending machines, originally used to save the coupons on the card.
This is where the information about the validity of their document will be displayed on the screen of the device.
The Sudetenland demanded a referendum in the United States.
The Sudeten Germans demanded in 1945 that <0xC5><0xA0>umava be integrated into the United States.
This stems from a letter deposited in the collections of the Jiho<0xC4><0x8D>eská v<0xC4><0x9B>decká knihovna (South Bohemian Scientific Library).
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want at least to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
In 1945, certain groups of Sudeten Germans allegedly addressed the President of the United States with such a desire.
Among other things, this stems from a letter preserved in a private archive, which is now deposited in the collections of the Jiho<0xC4><0x8D>eská v<0xC4><0x9B>decká knihovna.
Germans from <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> Krumlov ask the US president in the letter not to allow "<0xC5><0xA1>umavská <0xC5><0xBE>upa" (forest region south of Bohemia) - annexed by Hitler under the Munich agreement - to be returned to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation well and want to be really sure that the words proclaiming that American troops come to German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," the letter, signed "People, whom the fate of the <0xC5><0xA0>umava is close to heart," reads.
Given that the rallying to Czechoslovakia is supposedly promising - knowing the Czech national character - only of brutality, disrespectful attitude, incomprehension, oppression and servitude, the authors of the letter ask the American president to take into his hands the protectorate of <0xC5><0xA0>umava for now and forever.
“We cannot believe that you would grant this territory to a state foreign to us, which oppresses and destroys minorities and has contributed nothing to the victory of the Allies without taking into consideration the opinion of the quarter of a million of the inhabitants,” the letter reads.
The alleged reason why the authors cannot sign the letter is the fear of the desire for revenge of the "Czech oppressors".
If the US president doubts the opinion of the Germans of <0xC5><0xA0>umava, he would only have to organize, according to the authors of the letter, a referendum in the region to establish whether its inhabitants wanted to be part of the US, or to live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text contained in the letter may, given current knowledge of post-war history, seem somewhat naive, according to some survivors, it illustrates well the expectations of the Sudeten Germans of the time.
While the Czech Germans had at least to foresee that the question of their expulsion from the republic would arise, very few of them would admit to such a possibility.
Some expected that the United States and Great Britain would obtain for the Sudetenland a certain type of autonomy.
Others believed that they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice, confirms this.
During the war, he was, as a German of <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice, engaged in the navy in the Baltic countries.
When, at the end of the war, he was captured by the English and placed in the Holstein region capture camp, dozens of Czech Germans came to consult him to teach them Czech.
“They believed that once they got home, the Czech would be profitable for them,” Chalupa said.
None of the captured Germans living in Czechoslovakia before the war believed that, as a result of the Bene<0xC5><0xA1> decrees, he would be expelled from the republic.
You don't think - you pay!
An emotional campaign will attack drivers
The most expensive road safety action in Czech history.
A way to characterize the emotional media campaign that intends to launch, Wednesday, the Ministry of transport.
Minister Ale<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0x98>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek's office believes it will discourage drivers from dangerous driving behaviour.
This campaign costing 150 million will appear on television, radio, cinema, on the internet, but also on leaflets.
It should discourage drivers from driving fast and drinking while driving.
But also remind them to take the belt before starting.
It wants above all to touch the conscience of young drivers, bikers, pedestrians, not to mention professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Especially personal stories that will attack emotions.
This is also reflected in the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign:
You don't think - you pay!
The phrase "You don't think" is capitalized on the license plate.
Then, in a puddle of blood, there's the phrase "You'll pay."
This should symbolize that one can pay from life a moment of inattention.
The spots will "haunt" the spectators until 2010.
The ministry drew inspiration from similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where images with drastic images of accident victims can commonly be seen.
He believes that this will lead to a decrease in the accident rate and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the agency Euro RSCG.
The sugar and whip strategy against drivers
“What works with drivers is the sugar and whip system.
For them, sugar is represented, for example, by the fact of saving time, when they grill a red light.
Whiplash is the threat of a fine or an accident.
The risks must be reminded to drivers," says Martin Ko<0xC5><0x99>án, the transport psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
This is how we need information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertisements, believes the psychologist.
Signs that signal danger to drivers are already less effective, he said.
"When a static panel warning of a danger is installed, it will probably quickly merge with the environment and drivers will no longer notice it," Ko<0xC5><0x99>án said.
Olmert would give back in exchange for peace almost all the occupied territories
Ehud Olmert, the president of Israel’s provisional government, called for the return of virtually all of the territories occupied in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He made the statement in an interview published Monday by the daily Yedioth Ahronoth.
“We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories, if not all,” Olmert told the daily.
"We will keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we will have to cede to the Palestinians a similar percentage (of Israeli territory), since without that, peace will not be made," he added.
He admitted that the possible restitution would include East Jerusalem.
"Anyone who wants security in Jerusalem, and above all does not want tractors and bulldozers to crush his feet, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem," Olmert said, referring to the two attacks in the city in July, in which several people were killed and dozens injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mount, the sacred and historical places" located inside the Old City.
“Anyone who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will be forced to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won’t work,” he said later.
Retreat from the Golan Heights
Olmert also called for Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he said was an indispensable condition for a peace deal with Syria.
This would also require some efforts on the part of Damascus.
"I am not proposing to make peace with Syria solely on the basis of a Golan retreat," he said.
"The Syrians know very well what they will have to give up to get the Golan.
They will have to give up their current relations with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with Hezbollah (Shiite movement); they will have to give up the constant support they give to the terrorism of Hamas (Shiite movement), Al-Qaeda (terrorist network), as well as that of Jihad (holy war) in Iraq.
Questions that arise after the accident: Are the stewards in the coach illegal?
The law ignores them; walking in a long distance coach is forbidden
In the context of the tragic accident of the Student Agency bus near Padua, Italy, the question arises whether stewards and passengers can move inside the bus during the journey.
"If you want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of a steward is contrary to the law on road traffic," transport ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka said.
The accident in question, in which a 22-year-old flight attendant died, was apparently caused by the driver of a truck that crossed the bus's path.
The girl was unfortunately sitting next to the driver, in the most dangerous seat of the vehicle, although she had two other seats at her disposal.
However, the bus can have an accident, or even brake abruptly, even when the steward serves the coffee or distributes the newspapers.
What matters is whether the coach is equipped with standing seats or not.
If this standing equipment is not approved, passengers must remain seated.
The long-distance buses Student Agency do not have standing spaces; this was confirmed in Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz by the director of the company Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura.
"This is an issue that we have dealt with with the ministry and, at the beginning, it prohibits any travel of passengers.
Then they canceled it and we got passengers to go to the toilet during the ride as long as they have their own seat,” he said.
The Law Ignores the Steward
“There is no one-size-fits-all legal interpretation of the role of steward – no legal prescription deals with that role.
On the other hand, there is also no legal requirement to prohibit the carrier from offering services.
The law on road transport knows only the term vehicle receiver; it does not define its rights and duties," adds spokesman Hanzelka more ambiguously.
Josef Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, the director of the Department of Road Traffic, believes, on the contrary, that the law sufficiently addresses the problem.
"It all depends on whether the bus has permission to offer standing seats in its approval.
It's all in there," he said.
Buses are divided into urban, where there are standing places and a limited maximum speed, intercity with standing places and a higher permitted speed and long distance coaches without standing place with the highest permitted speed and seats equipped with seat belts.
Like on the plane, says an expert
Jaroslav Ho<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>n, an expert at BESIP (road traffic safety) in transport safety, does not see the movement of stewards on board as a major problem.
"During regular traffic, there is no danger. The situation can be compared to that of service in airplanes.
There, too, it is not certain when turbulence will occur and the air hostess may bump her head.”
“If the bus braked abruptly, the laws of physics would obviously apply.
In the same way as in an urban bus or a tram.
The carrier has to manage the safety of the stewards through internal requirements," he says and also believes that from the point of view of the law, the problem is not solved.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura is ready to remove these services
Student Agency is the only coach carrier to offer the services of stewards.
He hired two hundred.
Even after this accident, the director does not consider their trade to be a risky trade.
"Nevertheless, as soon as I get the impression that this is a risky trade, I will remove it.
Passengers can receive their coffee and newspaper upon boarding.
It would also cut costs,” he said.
The concern for safety is the reason given by the director of the Asiana Alexei Litvin, who ensures, in comparison with SA, a very small number of lines.
"We don't have any hostesses. We have opposed it from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end in a fatal accident," he told T<0xC3><0xBD>den.cz a year ago.
A huge tragedy has happened
A young hostess from the Plze<0xC5><0x88> region, who had been working for the company for two years, died in the accident on the Naples line.
A Slovenian truck probably left the emergency stop strip without using a turn signal and blocked the way to the bus.
The driver of the latter trying to avoid him by means of a sudden maneuver, but he brushed him by his right side.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura refused to allow the two seats reserved for the stewards to be sold.
"In the case of long-distance lines, it is not possible to book these places, they are blocked."
The company plans to file a complaint against the driver of the truck.
For the compensation of the girl's family, the agency will not wait for the judgment of the court, but with regard to financial compensation, it also relies on the culprit.
A change in the law?
Not in sight
An amendment to the law, which has been under development for more than a year by a group of thirty experts from the Ministry of Transport, could clarify the movements of stewards on board the coach.
"However, it has not reached any conclusion on this point.
To tell the truth, she is not too interested in buses, but rather in the system of points, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of the mobile phone at the wheel," says the expert Ho<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>n.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the stewards as something that would fundamentally endanger the safety of passengers," Hanzelka concluded, adding that the control of the safety of buses is under the power of the police and the Office for Safety at Work.
The hopes of D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorfers are based on Frankfurt.
There was no shortage of words in the WestLB steering committee’s letter to the house’s employees.
By means of a union of the entities of the financial institute of D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf with the Deka-Bank of Frankfurt, "the central institution of the financial markets of the financial group of the Sparkasse" could be constituted, according to the mail made public Monday.
WestLB would bring a "competence block" coupled with sustainable productivity in such a case.
All in all, such a relationship could be the decisive trigger for further mergers in the L<0xC3><0xA4>nder banking sector.
This is what it looks like when a steering committee is keen to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times.
Because the WestLB, injured, is always under great pressure.
It is not only the European Commission but also the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority that has, only recently, made it clear to the government of the Land of North Rhine-Westphalia that time was running out in the search for a future solution.
For some time now, however, there has been talk - also on the Frankfurt side - of a relationship of some kind between Bank Deka, which knows Sparkasse's customers through their investment funds, and WestLB.
It is true that the head of Deta-Bank, Franz Waas, said at the presentation of the figures for the six-month period at the end of August that he did not see any sense in the merger of the Mainzer Landstrasse house with a Land bank, either Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Deka board of directors, each half of which is supported by the L<0xC3><0xA4>nder banks and savings bank groups, has instructed the steering committee to conduct talks with WestLB for joint business activities.
It could then be the flow of the financial market, or parts of it.
Talks have only just begun, however, they say in the financial centre.
This is not the first time that Deta-Bank, which with its 3,000 employees is one of the largest employers in the financial centre of Frankfurt, has come into play when it comes to the consolidation of the savings bank sector.
In 2003 it was believed for a while that Deta-Bank could merge with the Landbank of Rhineland Palatinate and Halbab.
Yet nothing has emerged from this ternary bouquet.
Hardly had the plans been made public that the government of the Land of Hesse ruled against any participation of the Hellaba in them.
After that, the other two houses also did not join.
The Bank of the Land of Rhineland Palatinate was attached instead to the Bank of the Land of Baden-Wuttenberg in Stuttgart.
But there have always been new negotiations on the merger of the Deka-Bank with banks in the L<0xC3><0xA4>nder.
Finally, G<0xC3><0xBC>nther Merl, chairman of Hellaba's board of directors, spoke out against any commercial strategy to merge with his bank.
Irrespective of this, there seems to be a growing sense that the consolidation of the various public sector institutions is particularly urgent.
Now that the election to the Bavarian parliament has passed, a union between BayernLB and the Baden-Wuttenberg bank could come to fruition first.
For Helaba, this is not particularly good news.
If the pressure for further mergers were to increase, the potential partners gradually escaped him.
In the South, it would now be a junior partner, although it has so far weathered the crisis better than the banks in Munich and Stuttgart.
The Hesse-Thuringia savings and transfer bank group, which owns 85 per cent of Helaba's capital, blocked any merger with WestLB earlier this year.
The NordLB would remain in the strictest possible terms.
Such geo-strategic reflections, however, reflect only one facet.
Another facet is the question of how the different business models of each of these banks can be matched.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive question, by which business model the future capacity of the L<0xC3><0xA4>nder banks should be ensured, had not been resolved by the German savings and transfer banks.
In the long term, a cutting of the WestLb could take place, which here is obviously not desired.
This is also what is discussed in the letter of the board of directors in place: in any case, a "comprehensive solution" for the establishment would be envisaged.
How all this will be put in the same basket with the union of some entities with the Deta-Bank remains to be seen.
The second weekend of the beer festival is also known as the weekend of the Italians.
For Elena, this is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena accompanies him as a girlfriend, and so nothing is the same, he says.
Behind them, nearly a five-liter keg of Kaiser brand beer, stands a well-built bearded man who shows about 200 beer party visitors what deep sounds his throat can produce.
Elena taps Luca first, then kisses him.
From Bologna, they came to Verona.
From there, from the bus station near the station Puorta nueva, four buses take tonight the departure at 23:45, <0x60>destinazione Monaco, festa della birra', arrival scheduled at 6:30.
Three buses are reserved above all for Italians, in one of the buses traveling Brazilians exclusively.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South Americans are singing gold and already next to their flag, they have already celebrated last night.
And also noisy, explains Marco Guarda, it is not for Italians.
The buses belong to Marco, who wears a long coat lined with faux fur and sunglasses with large silver frames.
For the past five years, they have been going to the beer festival, already three outings this year alone.
They go there at night, stay the day at the party, and return at 10:30 p.m.
Spending the night there would involve unnecessary costs, explains Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome pot with a Kaiser beer, brewed in accordance with the Bavarian purity law, health insurance and an official of the German-speaking group - Marco took a language course in Frankfurt.
And already the buses run at night on the Autostrada direction <0x60>Brennero'.
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly, everything becomes quiet on the bus, travelers sleep.
Better yet, they will still need your strength.
Breaks will be made in Bressanone, and in Holzkirchen, while a large number of other buses with Italian license plates are once again taking a break just before Munich, on Highway 8.
When in the early morning, Marco's group finally arrives at 6:30 as planned in the parking lot near the Place Thér<0xC3><0xA8>se, nearly 50 other buses from all over Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco gives a final speech, explains the plan of attack.
First of all, wear the little yellow hat.
Above is written on the left <0x60>Festival of beer', in Gothic, and next to the internet address of Marco's travel agency <0x60>conoscersiviaggiando.it'.
Second: <0x60>When the doors of the beer marquee open, we run,' cries Marco in the early morning.
<0x60>Run!' Run and reserve places at the back of the tent.
<0x60>Not in front, otherwise we block, and not all the yellow caps on the same benches, we must distribute them in the room!'
The glass, Marco shouts, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget the instructions!
<0x60>Show the security guards that we are behaving well!
As soon as you leave your seats, they're gone!'
Third, "Tonight, to be back here at ten-and-a-half!"
And that's it, it's gone to the beer party.
On the way, someone ties yellow hats to trees to find the way, signs and even an election poster of a large Bavarian popular party.
We want to be ready for the return.
It is the second weekend of the beer festival, known as the <0x60>weekend of the Italians'.
There are no precise figures; there are talk of 50,000 who set off across the Alps and collapse in the beer kiosk, 10 percent of visitors would have come on purpose from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police are reinforced by seven police officers from South Tyrol, by Italian volunteer rescuers who support the Bavarian Red Cross which carries out a statistic on the countries where the Italians occupy the first place before the British (60 interventions) and the Austrians (about 80) with almost 200 medical interventions.
The one that is particularly appreciated by Italians is the tent of the Hofbr<0xC3><0xA4>u brewery.
Insomnia Nights for Hypo Real Estate Shareholders
The German banking system is relatively stable, insisted the Federal Minister of Finance only a few weeks ago.
How fortunate that the politician used the word ‘relatively’ and that he slipped that the German banking sector would not be spared from crisis movements.
This one actually happened this weekend.
The financier of the Bavarian real estate Hypo Real Estate (HRE), alongside the DAX, obtains from a consortium of German banks a loan of one billion to protect itself from the turbulence of the markets.
A person with confidence in the situation told Reuters on Monday that aid credits are issued up to an amount of 35 billion euros.
The Hypo Real Estate would now have to pay interest on the fraction to which it would be entitled.
The money comes from private banks as much as from public banks.
In the background, it is the daughter company Depfa that bears the losses.
The state financier had, according to a newspaper article, refinanced himself in the very short term for long-term projects for which he had borrowed money - which is no longer possible since because of mistrust of the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's cash reserve had been reduced from 95 percent to 2.37 million euros, the rate of equity also had slightly weakened from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
Outstanding and net profits from financial transactions had fallen to zero compared to the same period last year, while profits from the allocation of receivables and specified securities and the termination of provisions in credit operations had fallen by more than 70 per cent to EUR 5 million.
And it is only thanks to the significant profits from the reimbursement of the downstream accounting costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa group, as well as the repayment of interest according to the book of tax procedures and commercial purchases for the companies of Konzern, that the earnings deficit of about 16 percent turned out to be moderate.
After its privatization in 1990, the former state financier had at first speculated badly on industrial real estate loans, which then had been subsidiaryized to the bank Aareal.
Because conventional state financing was not profitable enough, Depfa then became more actively involved in infrastructure projects and in financing joint projects between private investors and the state (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
On the value of the daughter company, the Hypo Real Estate must make amortizations that should have on the calculation of the gains and losses of the group an essential material effect that still remains rather unclear.
The fact is that the dividends have been amputated.
By 2007, they had been cut to two-thirds.
Hypo Real Estate is, since the acquisition of Depfa, a highly important state and infrastructure investor.
It is stronger than other refinancing-dependent institutions on the interbank market as it has no client deposits.
With the bankruptcy of the investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, lending between banks has once again dried up considerably, as banks have accumulated their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs annually for a part - about 50 billion euros - of all the credits of the Depfa of a short-term means of refinancing.
According to a statement from Hypo Real Estate, the group's financing need is covered with medium-term credit and the company protected from the influence of international financial markets largely out of order currently.
Other sources say that the refinancing would be provided through the funds until the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, Chairman of the Board of Management of HRE, however, explained that the Hypo Real Estate Group should no longer have to resort to financial markets in the medium term.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Institution for the Supervision of Financial Services (Bafin) assume that the Hypo Real Group's market capacity is now assured.
The bank’s shareholders and creditors can only hope so.
However, given the dynamics and weightlessness of the crisis, there is no certainty.
It is not inconceivable that funding should not be used to its full extent.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out either.
After the fact that the bank is, according to the latest releases, still on the verge of insolvency Sunday evening, this rescue at least temporary will not succeed in reassuring minds either.
The share price fell 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
Bond prices, on the other hand, are doing particularly well.
While debts in the first place have barely moved, the prices of second-tier loans are falling.
The most affected are especially the investment funds of the former daughter company W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg Hypo and those of course that have a lifespan beyond 2009.
The bonds of the bank Hypo Real Estate previously appeared to be an alternative speculative investment, now their value must be considered dependent on the stability of the international banking system after the net hardening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the same institute that brought the crisis into the institution by the purchase of the bank Depfa.
As long as the issuing institutions, governments and less affected commercial banks are still prepared to support the system, a reduction in arrears over time can be assumed.
Or it will happen what no one dares hope at the moment - that the financial crisis can be overcome in the next 15 months.
But in the face of renewed rumors of partial nationalization, the probability that approached safety has now become a mere well-founded hope.
This should reserve sleepless nights above all for long-term creditors on the decision whether to part with their commitments.
Short-term investors can still use what they have drawn a line to defer losses for the next few years on the next capital gains tax automatically levied.
Sylvana and the secrets of the box in Bento
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop has to show up for her first day at Tachibana High School, the girls start laughing: the German girl is so kawaii!
What's that supposed to mean?
Sylvana already knows this word thanks to Mangas - in her new Exchange Log, she talks about Japan.
"The first day of school in Japan.
What was I excited about?
Already the way to go to school scared me.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and I take the train 40 minutes to Tachibana High School.
I had to find my own way, fortunately I didn't get lost.
The beginning of the courses does not seem to be set as strictly as at home in Lower Saxony.
The students appear one after the other from eight o'clock, until at nine o'clock minus twenty, a round of the table begins with the teacher, the "home room".
But before the class started, it was up to me to introduce myself.
I’m not at all the kind of person who likes to talk in front of people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
As I did not yet have the school uniform, I put on an old skirt from my host mother, as well as a shirt, blue high socks and black leather shoes.
In this outfit, therefore, I presented myself in front of the desk, and tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - My name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and my birthday is in a week.
At that time, I was very happy to have started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class all made low masses, puffed with laughter and made signs, and I constantly heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew him through my manga.
It belongs to the vocabulary essential to the survival of Japanese teenagers and means "cute, cabbage".
Then I quickly slipped into my place.
The girl next to me gave me a big ironic smile, she thought it was an honor for the correspondent to sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was pretty quiet, but when the gong rang, I was assaulted within the rules.
Everyone was talking to who was better, laughing and asking me a lot of questions - in this case, it's quite difficult to understand English Japanese.
During the break, they all took out their Bentos.
My host mother had also made me this kind of Lunchbox - it's really something other than the miserable German snacks.
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, a cucumber and seaweed salad, fruit and a kind of meat surrounded by Tofu.
Most of the time, I have no idea what exactly I eat here in Japan.
Things have a strange appearance and a completely new taste.
What is certain is that everything is really good.
Well, except maybe the candied salted plums, brrrrr!
Bentos are not just lunches in Japanese schools.
Sometimes a girl offers a boy a Bento that she has prepared herself, and which is then prepared particularly carefully - in the hope of being able to get to know the boy a little better during the break.
I read that in my manga.
I wonder if I could watch it here too.
“Why Japan in particular?” my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to spend a year at school in Tokyo.
So I always answered:
“Because it fascinates me, what?”
At the end of the day, reading manga has been my favorite thing for years.
And in order to better understand the manga and the culture that is there, at one point, I also began to learn Japanese.
For me, it was really clear that I had to travel there one day.
Because I also have a weakness for traditions, customs and customs.
And here, they are given a lot of importance.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything is so well organized, I never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I’ve ever seen.”
Rats have feelings too.
A rat or a cockroach flees in the face of danger, does that mean that it also feels fear?
The neurophysicist Joseph LeDoux is convinced of this: many animals also have sensations.
But how can we verify that he feels the same when he behaves in the same way as we do?
In the online magazine "Edge", contributions have been published for several years by famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of articles answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else having until now been able to prove it just as one cannot prove that other human beings have a conscience.
But in this case, one can at least hope that all human brains have the same configuration.
As soon as we turn to other species and address the questions of feeling or in general of consciousness, we enter into terrains that are difficult to practice because the Hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: it kills, flees, or attacks.
Human beings behave in the same way, which is why some scientists deduce a comparable subjective experience.
However, I do not believe it.
Two aspects of the structure of the brain make the transposition of our subjective experience to that of animals difficult.
One aspect is that the circuits almost always associated with human consciousness include the prefrontal lateral cortex (due to its participation in short-term memory and in the functions of direction and execution).
This vast region is much more developed in humans than in other primates and seems to be entirely absent in other beings.
At least for those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including the awareness of who we are, and the ability to predict and decide, it is reasonable to assume that the human being differs even from other primates.
Another significant peculiarity could lie in the linguistic nature of Man: since a large part of his existence is related to language, this often means that his consciousness depends on it.
In this case, the animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness were not to depend on language, it would surely influence it, so that animal consciousness, no matter how it is produced, would probably differ greatly from most of our states of consciousness.
This is why it is also difficult to determine what consciousness may look like in other animals.
If this, internal and subjective, cannot be measured or analyzed on the basis of our own experience because of this particular hardware, then its observation poses big problems for us.
Most of my developments refer to the content of conscious experience, but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be more easily accessible scientifically.
Animal consciousness processes could be examined without regard to their content, and this is exactly what happened in studies of the short-term memory of primates, particularly with the example of visualization.
But in this approach followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, we focus more on the nervous correlations of consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: both can be identical or not.
Curiously, this approach also highlights the weight of the prefrontal cortex in the realization of visualization.
But what does this mean for emotions?
I conclude that an emotional system such as fear is activated in a brain that is aware of its own activity.
What we refer to as “fear” is therefore the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its sequels, such as the reactions of the body) takes over the RAM.
Thus observed, emotions are closely related to the regions of the cortex that characterize primates and especially humans.
Subtle degrees of feeling, associated with our fickle nature, emerge, because we can, with the help of words and grammar, differentiate and categorize states to impute them to others than ourselves.
In contrast, Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that sensations from primitive activities arise in the corporeal sensation regions of the cortex and brainstem, just as Jaak Pankseep does, however, focus more on the brainstem.
As this network has not changed much during human evolution, it could quite participate in transversal sensations of all kinds.
From a purely theoretical point of view, I cannot contradict it, but I believe it to be indemonstrable.
Pankseep argues that what appears as fear in both men and rats is likely to be felt as fear in both cases: yet how could one check whether rats and men feel the same when they behave similarly?
A cockroach flees in the face of danger, but what if he feels fear?
In my opinion, similar behaviors are not enough to prove identical experiences.
Admittedly, the nervous comparison helps: rats and humans have similar brains, cockroaches, on the other hand, do not even have a brain.
But is the brain stem causing the sensations?
And even if we could prove this for humans, how could we prove it in rats?
I believe that rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?) have sensations.
But I don't know how to prove it.
And because their sensations are likely to be completely different from ours (since human consciousness relies on special circuits and language), I’d rather explore emotional behavior than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, progress is necessary on the nervous level to the extent that the same thing is measured in rats and in humans.
Since I don't explore language and consciousness in rats, or sensations, I don't know if they exist.
This could be judged as short-term, but I’d rather move forward than constantly bumping into a wall.
I am an emotional pragmatist.
UEFA President Platini: Poland and Ukraine get a grace period
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik explained that preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government considers UEFA's decision in Bordeaux to be a sign of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organise, in collaboration with Poland, the European championships," Wasjunik said.
“But this is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun, and there is still a lot to do in both countries.”
In the schedule of construction or destruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both hosts run after deadlines.
The number of stadiums for the European Championship could eventually be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We have to work at maximum speed," said Ukrainian League President Grigoriy Surkis.
“UEFA is constantly watching us.
An even more radical measure has been decided in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish football league PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee after numerous scandals and replaced by Robert Zawlocki, an independent administrator.
The commission had met at the request of the Minister of Sports Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be "a real danger that the PZPN is not able to act within the rules," said Drzewiecki of the Polish news agency PAP.
"We have assured the UEFA President in a letter that preparations for the 2012 European Championship will not suffer."
Several members of the Premier Division league were, already in the previous season, convicted of manipulative relegation; in the end, the start of the league had to be postponed to the last minute.
Dennis Quaid indignant counterattack
She wanted to promote a new movie, talked about her private life in an interview — and now has trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan has lifted the veil on her former adulterer Dennis Quaid.
It froths - and counterattacks.
A Late Rose War for ex-couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors engage in a disgraceful battle - in plain sight.
Last week, Meg Ryan spoke in an interview for the American newspaper InStyle about the causes of the marriage failure: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and it was very painful."
She reportedly became aware of the extent of the deception only after the divorce.
The motive for this striptease of thought lies in Ryan's press relations for his new film "The Women" - there is told the story of an adultery.
Dennis Quaid’s reaction to his calling as an unfaithful husband came out clearly: “It would be monstrous,” he told the 54-year-old New York Daily News that “Meg is once again undoing the story of our relationship and manipulating it.”
It would also be "regrettable" that "the pain and upheaval of a divorce for every child is once again revived in public" for their common 16-year-old son Jack.
While Ryan has lived alone since the divorce, Quaid has remarried and will soon become the father of twins.
So was his response to the claw blow: "In any case, my life goes on.
I feel happy to have a wonderful family that is at its best.”
Prices of plane tickets and hotels fall
In the first half of 2008, flights and hotel nights were cheaper than the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would even be reduced by up to 50 percent.
Flights and hotel nights would have become advantageous again - this is the result of a study by the travel and financial services provider American Express.
The company analyzed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and established, after a price increase in the first quarter, a sharp decline in profits in the second quarter.
After hotel market prices have been rising for years, hotel nights have already been reduced in many places.
From January to March, prices increased in 41 of the 48 European cities examined by an average of 6.9 percent compared to 2007 in 41 of the 48 European cities examined.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than the previous year.
The trend was clear, especially in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
The causes of all this would lie for American Express in the low price of the dollar that has led to a "desire for travel falling American tourists".
Financial centres such as Frankfurt or London would also be more affected by the decline in hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Swedish city, hotel prices stand with a 26.3 percent rise, the record in Europe.
Also in terms of flight prices, the trend was upward in the first quarter:
As a result of the increase in the price of kerosene, passengers in economy class had to pay on average 7.1 percent more than in 2007, long-haul flights, which are very fuel-intensive, have even increased up to 29.2 percent.
From April to June, economy-class ticket prices fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter; business and first-class ticket prices, however, were significantly less pronounced.
In Germany, prices fell even more than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had increased by 11.9 percent, in the second quarter they fell by 23.6 percent.
German domestic flights have even been halved according to this study.
The reasons for this fall in prices would be on the one hand a weakening economic growth, explains the firm.
Demand would give way in many segments of the air travel market.
On the other hand, there would be increased pressure from competition under the "Open Skies" treaty, which liberalizes air traffic between the United States and Europe.
A sign of the tense situation is the removal by airlines of unprofitable routes, as well as the high number of airlines that would have filed for bankruptcy during the first half of 2008 - they were 24 companies in Europe alone.
HSV beat Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods, SV Hamburg becomes first in the standings.
In Borussia, Luhukay still has not managed to find a functional eleven.
By Kristoffer Klein. Enlarge. Disaster landing for international player Marko Marin.
The Gladbach player did not return until late in the game and his free kick failed against the goal frame.
His message was precisely formulated, he came out of his lips persuasively.
He simply knew he was right.
“We need that second goal,” Hermann Rieger whistled in the hall of the Hamburg Arena dressing room.
Not much was happening in the locker rooms, the half was over and most had sat down in their place.
Rieger was for almost three decades the physiotherapist of the HSV, he enjoys a great reputation as many former protagonists.
And that is why his request was received at strategic places.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and raised his thumb to approve.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's head coach Martin Jol.
Whose orders seem to have been similar: and let it jump with this second goal!
The practice was lacking.
“Not everything was very beautiful to see today,” later Marcel Jansen confessed.
Bastian Reinhard would have liked to be more relaxed as well.
This 1:0 (1:0 at half-time), the Hamburg team owes it to a successful head-butt by Mladen Petric (in the 11th minute); and the fact that the very weak Gladbach players could not hurt the weak Hamburg players.
"It was a dirty victory," Marin Jol summed up.
The SV Hamburg will celebrate its 121st birthday on Monday.
Already Saturday afternoon, the fans were celebrating themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the provisional leaderboards on the giant screen that indicated their club as first in class.
It's going to be a birthday without a real party.
“We know how to take a step back,” Marcell Jansen said.
It is suspected that the intermediate result of the table reflects more the unpredictable character of the First League than the dominance of his HSV.
The team with its late arrivals – Brazil’s Neves and Silva, the debauched goalkeeper Petric as well as FC Bayern’s debauched Jansen – is forming slowly, but it’s not shining yet.
“We need more charm and more dribbles,” Jol demanded.
After the failure of the vote
On Wall Street, there is fear.
The first news of the failure of the rescue plan caused the Dow Jones to temporarily fall 700 points.
This was the biggest loss of points in a single day in history.
Later, the Dow Jones caught up a bit.
By 8:30 p.m., the world’s largest stock index was 10,579 points with a decline of well five percent.
The Nasdaq technology stock market index was at 1,548 points with a decline of more than seven points.
The biggest losers from the Dow Jones were on that date American Express which was losing almost 14 percent and Bank of America with a loss of about 12 percent.
No title could make any more profits.
The shares of Bank Goldman Sachs fell by almost ten percent.
Just a few days ago, the big investor Warren Buffett joined the company.
As part of the rescue plan, the means must be mobilized for the purchase of so-called spoiled mortgage papers.
However, the amount must not be paid at once, but gradually.
In return, the State should recover options on the shares of the financial company that can be exchanged as a result of the evolution of the price in order to reduce the burden on the Treasury.
Stock prices sucked into the whirlpool in Europe and the United States
Billions in aid to banks in Europe and the United States do not offset investor concerns.
The stock price of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate collapses and pulls the Dax to the bottom.
The US Dow Jones index is collapsing despite the rescue of the financial market planned by the state.
Spectacular declines in the prices of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have led the German index (Dax) to a deep deficit.
The Bavarian real estate financier’s stock has now lost three-quarters of its value despite the rescue operation by the federal government and private banks, with Commerzbank down more than 20 percent.
The Dax slipped well below the important psychological bar of 6000 points and stood at 5,839 points with a deficit of 3.7 percent.
All over the world, the stock markets have fallen to their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors feared that the U.S. government’s massive $700 billion bailout could not be enough to restart financial markets.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average at 10,809.25 points lost 334 points or 3.3 percent in the first hour.
The U.S. House of Representatives intended to vote on the bailout, with the Senate vote expected to follow on Oct. 1.
The other European stock exchanges have also seen only one direction: in London, the FTSE 100 index has fallen by 3.2 percent so far, the CAC 40 in Paris has lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, Japan’s main Nikkei index fell to 11,743.61 points after an initial rise of 1.26 percent.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index slipped 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the main Sensex index lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent and closed at 12,595.75 points.
In the MDAX, Arcandor shares fell after the announcement of a capital increase.
Private bank Sal. Oppenheim subscribed to the 23 million new shares.
The commercial and tourism multinational also said the shares will not be sold to Thomas Cook.
Dark matter influences the flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has left researchers in perplexity: dark matter influences the speed of space probes during what are called gravitational support maneuvers.
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity is not completely correct.
For almost 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" has been flying in space.
Due to soon-to-be-frozen fuel lines, cryogenic death threatens her.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has been causing disarray among researchers - the anomaly of gravitational support.
Gravitational support is a maneuver of space probes, by which they obtain an additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, the Earth for example.
Thus, the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The American-European Cassini-Huygens research probe used this physical trick, just like the Ulysses solar probe.
That’s what’s been surprising researchers for years: flying objects don’t always behave 100 percent the way you expect them to according to the venerable laws of gravitation.
There are also irregularities in the speed.
The probes unexpectedly become faster or slower.
Until now, physicists could not explain this effect.
They called it the anomaly of gravitational support.
Some experts feared that Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, which describes the force of attraction of matter due to the curvature of space, might not be entirely correct.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton still believes hard as iron that Einstein was not mistaken and tries to explain the anomaly of gravitational support with the help of what is called dark matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
"Dark matter could be responsible for this anomaly, which is also near Earth," he wrote.
Space researchers have only known about the existence of dark matter for about a decade.
It apparently emanates from it an attractive force whose effect is observable on other celestial bodies.
It, on the other hand, is completely invisible, that is to say that it neither sends nor reflects any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, dark matter would still represent a good fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After ten days at the hands of their captors, the kidnapped tourists in Egypt should be released, as the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
The Sudanese kidnappers demanded a ransom of several million euros.
During the pre-release shootout, six hostage takers were reportedly killed.
In southern Egypt, five Germans were abducted.
Negotiations for the ransom have already begun.
The Germans are constantly in the crosshairs of kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE depicts the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are visibly free.
This is what the Egyptian state television, the Arab television channel Al-Arabija and the Italian media have communicated together.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the bulletins of the Italian television channel Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been released.
We are checking their health," Frattini said.
The five Germans, the five Italians and the Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian escorts are doing well and are safe, Egyptian national television announced.
The 19 participants of the desert excursion should already be on their way to Cairo.
The circumstances surrounding a shooting before the hostages were released remain unclear: the kidnappers were close to stopping the kidnapping, according to an Egyptian security officer, before the Sudanese army killed six of the kidnappers without warning.
“The problem was solved.
They agreed to a ransom,” the officer said.
All that was left was to collect the hostages," when suddenly, "this surprise" happened.
On Sunday, Sudanese soldiers shot dead six of the kidnappers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt, and arrested two of them.
The hostage-takers had demanded a ransom from Germany in the amount of six million euros; the money was to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily El Masri El Jom reported that a German mediator said the release of the hostages was being delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the article, the kidnappers wanted to release the female hostages after the payment of the ransom.
The men were to be held until the kidnappers found a safe route to escape.
The German embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the story.
Abuse of a stepfather 'which led to suicide'
A court has been told that years of abuse by her father-in-law led a woman to commit suicide.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians, Cornwall, was jailed for six years after admitting eight counts of indecent assault.
The Truro High Court said he regularly tied up his daughter-in-law, Stephanie Randle, during her childhood, from 5 to 7 years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession letter, "I feel responsible for his death."
The court was informed that Ms. Randle, 34, committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007.
As a child when she lived in Coventry, Trerise had tied her up and bandaged her before forcing her into sexual acts, while her mother worked at the pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in Cornwall.
His daughter-in-law went to Plymouth.
But the court was informed that Ms. Randle, a hard-working National Trust volunteer, was haunted by the abuse she had been subjected to twice a week.
Attorney General Ramsey Quaife told the court that friends told her that Ms. Randle, who was a good surfer and cyclist, seemed since 2006 “emotionally dead,” and “had lost all hope for life.”
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in his Plymouth apartment.
It is believed that she committed suicide by suffocating with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's father-in-law who had also written a confession letter that ended: "I tied her up and flogged her regularly."
“I didn’t sexually abuse her.
“I feel responsible for his death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "You're really weird as a fetishist, your victim certainly had to be terrorized, especially at the age of 7.
"This unpleasant saga ended with the suicide of the victim.
And what’s even more amazing is the fact that if she hadn’t committed this act, her story would certainly never have ended in court.”
He added: "I particularly emphasize, as described by her father and mother, the effects of your crime committed for years on Stephanie.
"Without these, she would no doubt be a happy, promising, and successful young woman today."
Conviction for loss of official data.
The ministerial officer of the Cabinet Office who had forgotten top secret documents, in June on a train, will be condemned by the Official Secrets Act, the BBC learned.
The Ministry of Defence man was on the move when he forgot two highly classified documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents passed into the hands of the BBC before being handed over to the police.
This is the least serious condemnation of this act, without any insinuation of criminal intent.
BBC correspondent Frank Gardner said that this episode had a lot of people in Whitehall.
“They would have thought that this case would have remained within the walls of the Ministry of Defense and the Cabinet Office,” he said.
The employee who cannot be appointed is accused of violating section 8.1 of the act, that is, the clause that deals with the safeguarding of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service suggested that the ministerial officer be placed under the tutelage of the Metropolitan Police, given the very sensitive nature of his work related to the Associated Committee of Secret Services.
The documents he lost contained assessments of al-Qaeda as well as the resources of the security forces in Iraq.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was then transported from his home to a secret location.
Building companies facing the B&B invoice.
British construction companies may have to pay a bill of more than <0xC2><0xA3>80 million, to cover the rescue of the Bradford & Bingley bank.
The Government has provided <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion to protect the deposits of Bradford & Bingleys’ 2.6 million savers.
The interest on this loan will be paid by all companies that collect money from savers, including 59 construction companies.
Building Societies Association (BSA) chief executive Adrian Coles said it was “irritating” to know that companies and their members will have to pay for the broken pots.
The <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion loan will be repaid when the Bradford & Bingleys mortgages are cleared.
But the interest that will at the same time increase, will be debited, each year, to the 700 financial companies that collect the deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme has confirmed to the BBC that all 59 construction companies are included in this list.
It is irritating to see that institutions that have behaved prudently... now have to pay some of the bills of the institutions that were much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It is proclaimed that each company must pay a sum proportional to the deposits it holds, and that intermediary companies must pay about 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that the interest on the loan will amount to <0xC2><0xA3>450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find <0xC2><0xA3>81 million to pay the first year’s interest.
Adrian Coles, managing director of the building companies’ trade committee, told the BBC that the move appeared unfair to him.
It is "irritating" to see that institutions that have behaved prudently during the recovery of the real estate market, must now pay for much less prudent institutions.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since 1945.
“We need to look at every aspect of this case over the next few weeks, to assess options to avoid building companies and their members paying this salty bill,” Cole said.
Interest for 2009 covers seven months, from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010, we will have to pay the interest for the whole year, which could double.
Since construction companies are organizations without shareholders, their members end up paying the bill either by higher charges, or by lower interest rates for savings accounts.
Milk increases to five pence per litre
Jersey people have to pay more for their milk
Jersey Dairy has announced it will increase the wholesale price of its milk, by five pence per litre, from Monday.
This is the second price increase that follows a two-penny increase in February, and comes after a search by a consulting firm.
Retailers must decide if they will in turn raise the price to consumers.
. Before the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey milk was last changed in 2002.
Ex-Bangladesh PM denied bail
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a bail application for former PM Sheikh Hasina, which risks arrest upon her return to the country.
Her lawyers said the court refused to give her bail because of her indictment for extorting 50 million Taka ($729,000.00) from a businessman when she was PM.
This case is one of many accusations against him.
Khaleda Zia, Sheikh Hasina’s longtime rival, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to Bangladesh in a few weeks, but his party, the Awani League, has demanded that the country’s interim military government first give him his full freedom.
Correspondents pointed out that the terms of her release are contradictory because if she is allowed to leave the country for medical reasons, they do not see why she could not remain free upon her return to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers have announced that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the Supreme Court’s order.
“The Supreme Court rejected Sheikh Hasina’s application saying it does not require bail as she had been allowed to go abroad for medical reasons,” said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
“We will file an appeal against the Supreme Court’s order.”
Her lawyers argued that she needed the bail to return to the country in order to prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return after Oct. 17, a former leader of the Awami Party said.
She was detained last year after the interim military government assumed power, but was released in June for treatment abroad.
Sheikh Hasina, like Zhaleda Zia, denies the accusations against them.
Concerns about the Afghan anti-polio campaign.
In Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children have missed the recent polio immunization campaign due to Taliban-related violence, the UN said.
Last week, the UN carried out a vaccination campaign in all six provinces.
But she says she has been unable to reach children in the dangerous areas of Helmand and Kandahar in the south.
A UN spokesman said this happened despite promises by the Taliban not to attack or obstruct thousands of nurses during vaccinations.
BSkyB loses the ITV court battle
BSkyB lost its case following the Competition Commission’s verdict, which would force it to reduce its stake in rival broadcaster ITV.
The Competition Court ordered BSkyB to reduce its ITV shares from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The Commission stated that, in the past, MSkyB's participation had prevented competition and allowed it to unfairly influence ITV.
BSkyB bought its shares in 2006 following an agreement in fact aimed at preventing NTL, now called Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Fair Trading Bureau reported that BSkyB's purchase of ITV's shares cast doubt on ITV's effective independence, prompting the Competition Commission to investigate.
Virgin boss Richard Branson, a consumer group and regulator Ofcom were all opposed to the purchase.
BSkyB countered that forcing it to reduce its ITV shares would not be reasonable and on the contrary was excessive – especially since BSkyB has just given up its voting rights.
A new investigation into the U.S. prosecutors case.
The U.S. attorney general appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the firing of nine U.S. prosecutors in 2006.
This was the result of the report of the Inspector General of the Department of Justice, who criticized the actions of some ministerial officers.
The report was critical of White House officials, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation is based on the argument of lawyers who argue that their dismissal is due to political causes.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether officers interviewed during the investigation lied to investigators, obstructing justice.
"Serious allegations of potentially criminal, unfounded conduct have not been fully confirmed or resolved," Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report.
The appointment of a special accuser capable of forcing witnesses to testify was one of his greatest recommendations.
The dispute began with the delisting in December 2006 of nine U.S. prosecutors by the U.S. Department of Justice.
At the time, the department said prosecutors were fired because of poor performance.
But it later emerged that dismissed prosecutors were not more criticized than their other colleagues, prompting some observers to attribute political connotations to these dismissals.
Some of the prosecutors have been accused of being close to Congressional Republicans, while others reportedly refused to investigate fraudulent voting charges against Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors are investigating and prosecuting legal proceedings for the government.
It is certain that they can be dismissed at any time, but they cannot be dismissed for political reasons.
The head of the Justice Department, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, ended up accused of being involved in this dismissal case, and in the end, he resigned.
A number of ministerial officers of the Department of Justice also resigned.
The Inspector General's report was highly critical of Mr. Gonzales' role in this case, stating that he considered him "primarily responsible" for these layoffs, and ended up "abdicating" his leadership role, "remarkably managing not to be involved in this case.
Other ministerial officers, including former Bush aide Karl Rove, have been critical of failing to cooperate during the investigation.
Meat Loaf's epic must be honored.
Rock star Meat Loaf is set to be honored at the Q Awards for her epic song Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will receive an Oscar at the ceremony in London next week, said he was "honored" to get the recognition.
The nine-minute, fifty-second song was the title of Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
The evening of the awards ceremony is presented by Coldplay, with this year, a selection restricted to four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are songs that transcend things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a great voice like Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental section that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was released in the United Kingdom as a single in 1979, ranking fifteenth.
In addition, his album Bat Out of Hell remained in the English charts for nine years, and sold over 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - or Marvin Lee Aday, by his real name - has suffered from health problems in recent years, even undergoing surgery to heal his irregular heartbeat after collapsing on stage in 2003.
In 2007, a strong laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
Then they found a cyst in her vocal cords.
A dark street in the city, often forgotten, and may soon be on sale.
New York has hundreds of avenues, boulevards, streets and other parallel roads, some famous, others only functional.
. And even some veteran taxis as well as long-time local residents do not know how to give directions to get to Extra Place, because they have never heard of it.
The street is in the East Village and runs north of First Street – not to be confused with Second Street – between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide by 120 feet long, it looks like a dusty driveway rather than an active artery.
. No signs indicate the street.
It is virtually impossible to find it on a standard atlas.
This street has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the builder of the recent luxury buildings on First Street.
He would like to repaver Extra Place, and create a more fluid passage to the shops and boutiques, which should open in the new buildings.
Other admirers, including longtime neighbors, said they were charmed by this shortcut simply because it remains one of the last and oldest streets in the block.
But the city’s Department of Preservation and Real Estate Development, which manages the street, has no interest in keeping it.
This month, at a meeting of neighborhood homeowners committees, representatives from the city agency and Avalon Bay drafted a proposal authorizing the real estate developer to buy the street.
But the committee prefers the street to remain in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new proposal to be submitted next month, said Susan Stetzer, the local manager of the No. 3 Committee.
“There are only a few spaces left in the city, and we would like the city to keep Extra Place,” she said.
“They could offer to refurbish it and manage it, which Avalon could do, but we want to keep it public.”
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that it wanted to renovate the small street and install seats, some of which would be used by a café to which the builder would give the space.
The proposal for this potential acquisition was made public at this month’s meeting.
Avalon Bay spokesman Michele de Milly said that while the company wants to exploit the street, that doesn’t necessarily mean it wants to own it.
“Avalon Bay’s main interest is to re-look at this abandoned driveway, and make it public,” she said, noting that it was the city that suggested the sale.
Seth Donlin, a spokeswoman for Real Estate Preservation, confirmed that the city wanted to sell the street, noting that the agency’s mission was to develop the property rather than run it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a slight historical imprint.
Some believe that Extra Place has been named after it since 1802, when the legacy of the large farm of Philip Minthorne's many children was divided, leaving aside this small piece of land, which has since been abandoned.
The back entrance to the CBGB, a punk rock landmark closed in 2006, has reopened at Extra Place; the street is certainly more famous thanks to the cover photo of Ramones' "Rocket to Russia" album.
"This place was beautiful," said Ramones manager Danny Fields, who took the picture in November 1976.
It was full of scraps, rags, barrels, posters, leaves and ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers who had already talked about the East Village’s evolution to luxury, objected to the idea of selling Extra Place, saying that this humble little property should remain public.
Others have proclaimed Extra Place a true rarity—a fragment virtually identical to the city that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled "The Book of Contestations: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Extinction Process") tells the story of the City and Extra Place, published in 1952 in The New Yorker.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow little cul-de-sac, dark by day and night, and bounded by the gates of a rusty iron warehouse and shutters, full of last week's newspapers flying along the gutters."
With few exceptions, the street always looks the same.
A rat runs nimbly in the back of the alley, near a door that once led to the CBGB, and has now become the headquarters of a chic clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls, an empty 22-ounce bottle of beer, lies next to newspapers that have just been thrown away.
A few passers-by said they rarely think about Extra Place, and suggested that it be highlighted.
Field, for his part, said he thought some people underestimated the appeal of the street in its current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "were spent in dark, wet, disgusting places."
Bilingual Debate: Immersion in the English Language
In this part of the Education Supervision program, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the position of candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a former member of the California Studies, and former director of the Department of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book “Not as Good as You Thought. Why the Middle Class Needs to Be Able to Choose Their School.”
Attracting favors from Hispanic voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama’s proposals on education are an interesting example of this.
Obama’s campaign points out that “African-American and Latino students are less likely to graduate than white students.”
To combat these differences, Mr. Obama’s education program supports, among so many other topics, “bilingual transitional education” for those who learn English.
However, the question that arises for Obama is whether his desire to pursue a bilingual education that advocates classroom instruction in languages other than English, goes beyond his interest in eliminating differences.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
The students at this school are overwhelmingly Hispanic, and low-income.
More than a third of the students, made up of many newcomers, study English.
Among the students of the CM1, 100% passed the State exam of maths of 2008, expert level.
Similarly, almost 93% of students have passed the English-language-arts exam
This incredible success was achieved thanks to another ingredient than that advanced by Mr. Obama.
Sixth Street relies on analysis, practice, constant assessment of capabilities and exemplary attitude.
In addition, and this is an example that Mr. Obama could copy, reports Linda Mikels, principal of Sixth Street, this school has introduced the instruction of the English language "full immersion".
The total immersion in the English language focuses on the almost constant use of English in instruction.
Miss Mikels, contrary to bilingual education, told me "we had a huge success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico, 12 months later, if you went without his class, you would not have had any chance to identify him."
"It works," she observes, "it worked for us."
Shouldn’t Obama take the example of the Sixth Street Prep and replicate it in other schools made up mostly of Hispanic students learning English?
The excellent results obtained by this school speak for themselves; but the policies on education within its party (the Associations for National Education have long supported bilingual education) and its enormous support for bilingual education, obscure the prognosis of Mr. Obama's response.
While he is in favor of immigrants learning English, Mr. Obama recently considered this issue to be insignificant, when he proclaimed that we must all stop arguing about the wording of English language laws.
“On the contrary,” he said, “you have to make sure your child speaks Spanish.”
If Mr. Obama really wants to eliminate differences, then he should carefully consider the models of education that work, rather than dismissing them or considering them as insignificant.
Oil’s Net Fall as a Result of the New Concerns of the World Economy
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday as people worried that the bailout plan in favor of financial markets would bring the economy back to life.
Crude oil futures fell 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange during this morning's sales.
Prices have fallen by more than $20 a barrel since last Monday.
Over the past two weeks, commodity markets have been rocked by Wall Street financial turmoil, as well as two powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After experiencing an increase in July to $145.29 per barrel, prices fell to almost $90 per barrel this month, before rebounding again in view of the deep uncertainties of the financial markets.
On Monday, investors are again worried despite the agreement on the rescue plan, the largest in history, concluded this weekend by the leaders of Congress.
The news was tempered by recent concerns that the crisis would be long-lasting.
In the latest episode of this financial disaster,” Citygroup will purchase the banking operations of Wachovia Corporation, the government said on Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments nationalized the European financial conglomerate, Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said this weekend’s frantic negotiations, concluded with the bailout deal, “seem to have failed to revive the market.”
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for raw materials, including oil, is expected to slow.
“The outlook for global equity, interest rates and market exchange has become uncertain,” Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a letter to investors.
"We believe that raw materials will not be able to escape this contagion.
“As far as raw materials are concerned, our most pressing concern is to understand how far the U.S. virus would spread globally, and in particular, in China.”
The bank’s analysts cut their expectations for next year, given the declines in oil consumption due to the slowdown in economic growth, were therefore forced to decrease by 20 percent, the forecasts of oil and gas prices for 2009.
The party of the Second Time Determinant for the Improvement of the Team Record.
After spending the past eight seasons, more time than anyone in Jets uniform, Shaun Ellis thought he had seen it all.
He was watching the second half, when the Jets turned a 0-0 into an explosion.
“I’ve never seen anything like this,” Ellis said.
The second half began after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals played poorly under dark clouds.
Then quarterback Brett Favre managed to make a pass to Laveranues Coles allowing a 12-yard touchdown, a precursor to an afternoon during which their relationship made a leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns, the first when a corner back fell and the second, 10 seconds from halftime.
"I didn't get out of my zone," Favre said of all his passes to Coles.
“He is a mediocre player.”
“We communicated extremely well, despite what people think.”
While Favre and Coles played wrestling, the defense beat the Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, corner back, intercepted a missed shot and threw for 32 yards until the touchdown.
Eric Smith made another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker, David Bowens let the ball escape because of Warner.
At the last change, Bowens' loss of the ball, may well be the most charming event
The Cardinals took control of that possession for the final 10 seconds, and then the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely scoring a 20-yard goal taking a 34-0 lead.
It was the best the Jets could score in a while.
“Jets coach Eric Mangini, who was asked to describe this madness, said ‘second half or third?’
When told the two-the Jets let 21 undisputed points pass in the third half, Mangini said, "I can tell you that I enjoyed the second half more than the third.
." A lot of points were scored in a short time."
Gebrselassie rested, surpasses his world record.
Ethiopian Haile Gebrselassie once again proved himself worthy of his title as the best cross-country runner of the century, after breaking his own world record at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday, becoming the first to run 26.2 miles in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a 2:03:59 victory in an accommodative race on the flat, Gebrselassie beat his record of 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, played last year in Berlin.
At 35 years old, Gebrselassie won the 26th world record of his superb career during which he won the world championship or the world record for any distance, the 1600 meters of the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie missed the Beijing Olympic marathon, fearing - perhaps exaggeratedly in today's eyes - that air pollution would increase her asthma problems.
On the contrary, he promised to run in Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions- sunny weather, 48 degrees at the start, 55 at the finish- Gebrselassie won Sunday, now an impressive average of one mile in 4 minutes 43 seconds
Track runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat, both Kenyans, converted to long distance runners, have contributed to the marathon record’s decline by more than two minutes in the last ten years, since 1998, when Brazil’s Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin in 2:06:05.
After Sunday's win, Gebrselassie told reporters, he had suffered from calf cramps two weeks earlier, and missed training for a week.
It is obvious that the rest allowed him to remain bright, but not rusty.
“I’m so happy,” he told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I got back to it last week, and today I had doubts; but in the end, everything went well."
He has been criticized – especially in Kenya, Ethiopia’s African rival – for over-orchestrating his races, avoiding world marathon stars, actually relying on hares as if they were in a track competition, and considering world records more than the meaning of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the greatness of Gebrselassie's abilities as a long-distance runner.
Sunday Gebrselassie, preceded by four Kenyans, recorded a time of 1:02:04. halfway.
Two elite Kenyan riders, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the front-runners disappeared.
With just over three miles to go, Gebrselassie made his final ascent to break away from Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving on his personal best of five minutes.
Kamathis came third in 2:07:48.
In the women’s race, Kazakhstan-born Irina Mikitenko, now a German citizen, finished a remarkable year getting the seventh time of 2:19:19.
England’s Paula Radcliffe holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, Mikitenko, 36, surprised everyone by winning the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She could not participate in the Beijing Games because of a hypothetical backache, but promised to win in Berlin, improving on her third marathon, her personal best of almost five minutes.
She ran using a skilful strategy, letting the group of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners take a nice advantage, then surpassing them about 18 miles 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 later.
Askale Tafa Margasa of Ethiopia finished second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
In a City in Part, Pride and the Trials of Black Life
Hidden in the development of its huge park, a few miles from sunny, bright and giant Orlando, lies a quiet little town where pride and the complications of the African-American experience are born.
"Eatonville, first all-black town to be incorporated, childhood home of Zora Neale Hurston, this description she made in 1935, is no longer so simple to make nowadays." The town with five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 dark skins, 300 good swimmers, full of guavas, two schools and no prison."
It has now become a city of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Zora Festival in Eatonville to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And in a variety of ways, the city she describes—which became touristic thanks to its inclusion in The Depression-era Federal Writers’ Project’s Florida tourist guide—remains a place apart.
She is as independent, dignified, and private as she was in the 1930s, when Hurston said that the rural black population of Florida was often reluctant to share their true thoughts with the white man, who "knowing us so little, doesn't know what he's losing."
Even if this is the year of the election of a black president, Senator Barack Obama, who invoked an open dialogue on the theme of race, many here remain cautious of the foreign gaze.
“We’re very careful about how we tell the story,” said Hortense Jones, 59, a longtime resident and the city’s oldest parishioner.
“It has to be in line with reality.
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It represents both a historical model of a black takeover and a community of nearly 2,400 people where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a central point but also an example of Southern black rural culture - sometimes scorned, sometimes acclaimed - which recalls the birth of American slavery.
This would explain why the residents are both proud and protective.
The interest in the image of Eatonville born with Zora, who everyone here calls Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world through sincere, dialect-filled books such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida guide transformed this city, located just off Route 17, a road that crosses central Florida, often forgotten, which ends in a chapter of black history and human drama.
Bold as a cash register in life as in literature, Hurston led readers to the store owned by Eatonville’s first mayor, Joe Clarke, which was later divided into several private parts.
“After the road on the left,” she writes, “you’ll find the modern brown and white public school, with its well-preserved gardens and playgrounds that Howard Miller has always taken care of, although he barely knows how to read and write.
She also mentioned Widow Dash's new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds as well as everything that can be used by passers-by.
So, in barely a hundred words, Hurston associated Eatonville with self-government but also with illiteracy, remarriage, and sex.
Of course, Fodor was not like that.
It wasn’t really a portrait that everyone liked.
Zora described the reality well," said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of Johnson's young daughters Hurston immortalized, citing the colorless songs, performed by men who praised their beauty.
She added: "Some people didn't like it."
Hurston is still remembered as a lively and eccentric person, who returned frequently after his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that Hurston usually arrived in town unannounced in a big Chevrolet with a cigarette in his mouth and wore pants here, where even today, we are proud of traditional clothes.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, while many made fun of her.
“People were always happy to see Zora,” he said.
But he adds further, swinging in his chair from the backyard overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was certainly baptized, that "she never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of production.
Eatonville and the whole world seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in some sort of grave, at Fort Pierce, Fla, where she lived.
In Eatonville, no major commemoration, no plaque for the general public.
I don’t think they understood the contribution or legacy she gave to the world,” said Valerie Boyd, author of Wrapped in Rainbows, a 2003 biography of Hurston.
A crucial moment occurred in the 1980s.
Orange County officials wanted to move a five-lane highway into the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the community’s main two-lane street.
The development of Orlando has already pushed Interstate 4 to the west corner of the city.
The proposal was made just as Eatonville was recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among many other things, ended the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the race-mixing dispute brought hatred to the gates of the community.
"At that time, a bunch of young white people would come and throw oranges or objects at people sitting on the side," Franklin said.
“A lady has even died.”
They threw a watermelon out of their car.”
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court’s request for forced integration, calling his decision in Brown v. Board of Education “insulting rather than glorifying my race.”
Residents now proclaim that the elimination of racial segregation in schools, while positive in some respects, has diluted the cohesion of Eatonville and weakened the confidence of young people.
"Black kids used to be kissed -- I remember that -- our teacher would be kissed in the morning, and in the evening as well," said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and chief director of the Eatonville Community Safety, a nonprofit group.
This lasted, she added, until the teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
“You don’t kiss your white teacher because he’s white – I mean there’s a cultural dividing line here,” Ms Nathiri said.
Civil rights, moreover, have created space for many other Zora Neale Hurston—black writers, actors, and artists who have gone beyond prejudice, such as herself, armed with joyful self-confidence and lines of conduct such as: “How can they deprive themselves of the pleasure of my company!”
This is beyond me.”
In 1975, writer Alice Walker visited Hurston's unmarked grave and began struggling to revive his reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway, a real best seller, reintroduced it to the American canons.
The highway project came just as the most famous girl in Eatonville had regained her appeal.
And this time, Hurston’s old neighbors consider her a savior.
The community began organizing a Hurston Festival to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences of this highway.
Hundreds of fans came to the festival's opening two years later, and many return in January to commemorate it.
After many years, the county pushed back the highway proposal.
"The fiasco of the five-lane highway, extremely fast, a real civic pride," said Ms. Nathiri.
Miss Boyd summed it up by stating that "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the highway project allowed him to change his own image.
Non-residents, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has attended our church since 1993, began to come in large numbers, and residents began to reconsider the past.
Eatonville has been listed as a Historic City since 1998.
A single-theme library (renamed Hurston of course) opened in 2006, on a magnificent re-paved Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly for Florida: six miles from Orlando, it can at any time consider itself a back street on a rainy summer day, small as it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
(There are now 90 percent black people.)
Strangers who come to discover Eatonville's history, its raison d'<0xC3><0xAA>tre, are still treated with caution.
Permission must be sought for most interviews, and certain things—such as the walls of the old Eatonville church, painted by the white man, depicting black men in the fields—should not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Miss Jones, a courageous teacher with a soft spot for bright red, are still afraid that their island community will be well understood.
However, with the expansion of the Hurston festival, a certain level of local pride emerged.
Young people in particular, tend to view Eatonville as Hurston viewed his entire race: beautiful, problematic and all, neither better nor worse, but as proud, creative, hard-working, crazy and mixed as the other ethnic and racial groups in America.
The voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, is one of sincere civic affection and plans to return to Eatonville after college to work for the local government or police forces, who need additional forces.
And even for the younger ones, like 11-year-old Alondra and Alexia Kenon, twins from Winter Park, they seem to have learned the Eatonville description correctly.
“Most people, who pass through that area, will think, ‘Oh, this city has nothing compared to others,’” Alondra Kenon said after Mass last Sunday.
But if you stop and take the time to contemplate history, it’s a very beautiful city.”
Here in New York, everyone speaks fluently about finance.
In spite of everything, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stood away from the kiosk and giant TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn’t realize they’re in the eye of the storm.
Never could they think that in the glass and honeycomb offices above their heads, the bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York, spend the worst “office day” since the 1929 crash.
Couriers continue to sneak onto the sidewalks, with their carts and trays of muffins for morning meetings.
Latinos still hang between residential buildings carrying, like mules, about fifty luxurious shirts hanging from a yoke on their shoulders.
Office workers continue to queue to buy their morning sandwiches from street vendors, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between 4pm and 7pm on weekdays.
I had not felt the crisis despite the completely pessimistic stories until this afternoon when I decided to open a new savings account.
Fortunately, I had planned to work in the late afternoon, because I discovered at my local branch of JP Morgan Chase, about twenty people queuing.
Not in front of the cashiers' counters, or to withdraw cash or make a payment, but in front of the customer service counter, where the usual customers ordered their checkbooks, the tourists asked for the direction for the Macy's store, and the new customers opened accounts.
Most of those in front of me, I would later learn from Starr, my “authorized personal banker,” were all lining up for the same reason I was.
Not in the same way, because they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks, like those in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They have withdrawn their money from savings accounts called thrifts (such as a construction company), credit associations, and the type of local savings banks and their subsidiaries that only operate in one state, and which say they treat customers like their family.
In the recent past, 15 of these banks have gone bankrupt.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a $327-a-share bank, turned to the bankruptcy trustee, and as New Yorkers headed home for the weekend Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, with $440 million in savings accounts, was desperately looking for a buyer to save it.
The office and store employees in front of me, scared of another potential debacle, have transferred their money to a bank that seems to them reliable, the one that makes the most rescue on Wall Street.
Some New Yorkers have become very familiar with the world of finance in recent weeks.
“I heard a lady at my local Chinese supermarket talking on the phone about Lehman Brothers, the bank that went bankrupt, and its meager CEO Dick Fuld, with the same familiarity she might have had for criticizing a colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed janitor at my building, changed the subject of our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or my fruit and vegetable dealer deliveries.
She told me, following my visit to the bank, "I put all my savings into the money market.
“I’ve changed, I don’t want to take any risks.”
Muslim graves desecrated as Austria swings to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, who left the right wing of the Austrian Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right-wing Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to present the organization of "cities against Islamization" in Antwerp, Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry road signs depicting mosques striped in red.
Police accuse far-right extremists of desecrating an Austrian Muslim cemetery on the weekend of the far-right political parties' victory in the country's general election.
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged at the Traun cemetery near Linz between Friday night and this morning, according to police, an organized action.
Offenders have painted Jewish symbols such as the Star of David on several graves, but detectives believe it could have been done to disguise extremists’ hatred of Muslim immigrants.
Could this accident be somehow election-related?
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said it was "deeply shocked" at the announcement of the desecration, which comes just during the religious month of Ramadan that is coming to an end.
Austria is seriously thinking of regaining its courage, following its swing to the right in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that won almost 30 percent of the vote, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, waged an anti-immigration campaign, some of whose slogans were even seen by critics as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the vote, led his campaign against the wearing of headscarves and burqas, and even expressed his opposition to alaha food.
During his final race in Vienna, he spoke of "a European fraternity" to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both parties are trying to prevent the construction of mosques and minarets, proclaiming that they would constitute a political symbol of the Islamization of Austria and Europe.
The polls and analyses carried out just after the elections, defined the far right as the strongest political bloc in the country, which is demonstrated by the majority of young voters who made the difference, because worried about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter banned from traveling abroad.
The courts have banned the glamorous rock star, Gary Glitter, accused of child sexual abuse, expatriation in France and Spain.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter, after he expressed to the authorities under his control, his intention to travel to Spain via France.
Police in Kent issued the travel ban last Thursday after proving Glitter's guilt for child sexual abuse.
Glitter, or his real name, Paul Gadd, was not present at the Ashford Court hearing, but was represented by his attorney Corker Binning.
A court spokesman said: “On Thursday 25 September at Ashford Court, Kent Police requested an application to prevent Mr Paul Gadd from travelling to France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd was not present at the time."
Glitter, 64, informed the authorities that he wanted to go abroad, even if he was registered in the lists of accused of sexual abuse.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to go abroad for more than three days.
He must also inform the police, 7 days before his scheduled departure date.
If he does not communicate his movements to the authorities, he could serve a sentence of up to five years in prison.
Kent police said they would not discuss any specific cases or Glitter's potential movements into the county.
A Kent Police spokesman said: “Kent Police will do everything necessary to protect our children as well as those abroad.
“We think it’s easier to monitor someone who stays in the UK because we have devices that can manage any potential risks, much more effectively.
“Protecting the people of Kent is Kent Police’s most cherished intention, and we are closely monitoring the behaviour of those accused of sexual abuse in the area, to minimise potential risks to the public.”
Glitter returned to the UK last month after serving 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls, aged 10 and 11, respectively.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok from where he was supposed to board a flight to London.
But he said he did not feel well, and refused to leave for London.
Thai authorities blocked him from passport control, and in the end, he left for Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities refused him entry into their territory, and he was therefore forced to return to Bangkok; Thai police and immigration officers insisted that he return to England.
He finally arrived at Heathrow Airport Terminal 3 on 22 August and, remained there while his lawyer, David Corker, went to the Uxbridge, West London, limited jurisdiction court to register him on the list of persons accused of sexual abuse, as required by Scotland Yard.
In the past, Glitter had already been serving a four-month sentence in the UK for possessing images of child abuse.
An Interior Ministry source said Interior Minister Jacqui Smith was reassured and pleased to learn that Glitter had been banned from travel in France and Spain.
"I photograph the master off stage to capture elements of his character" G<0xC3><0xBC>nther Bauer - Photographer
No heels, no quirky clothes.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, freed from all tensions to obtain the relaxed aspect of man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other, the person.
Inseparable except in the intimacy, in those moments unknown to the general public, where we discover intimate gestures and stolen looks of artists who do not care to go on stage.
The German G<0xC3><0xBC>nther Bauer mixes in "Flamenco - people" the theatricality of some staging with singers, dancers and guitarists with this less known side of the artists.
In this project, the photographer takes up the particular iconography of flamenco from different angles.
Included in the program of the Flemish Photography Month, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, bigger every day", explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco - people" "can be anyone but, after seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not typical images of artists on stage.
These people photographed "in the street" are artists capable of transmitting on stage passion, sadness, joy ... captivating the public.
To capture moments of personality of these artists it is not necessary to take pictures on stage.
They have their own personality and character.
What interested me was to create an intimate atmosphere that allowed me to capture with the camera moments of personality of the flamenco stars ".
With the "People's Song of the Mines" festival, Bauer began in 1997 a long journey to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a plate camera.
These are portraits that, thanks to the choice of camera and equipment, recall classic photography.
The implementation of different stylistic means breaks with the classical side of the image, giving it a touch of modernity, this reflects the perception of flamenco according to Bauer: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and that surprises every day".
It is not about the dance or the song itself, but about the personality and character of the artist who captivates the public with his art.
The search for the essential and the magic has been the constant of this work that is presented these days at the gallery El Fot<0xC3><0xB3>mata.
Flamenco stars like Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are part of the selection made from about seventy photographed artists.
The project has turned into an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a book of portraits exhibited at the gallery.
Bauer's passion for portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with the "Portraits of old sportsmen" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco - people", the photographer admits that he loves photographing the portrait of people, getting to know them and being able to enter their lives for a moment or two.
I believe that in photography the portrait is the most difficult genre.
You find yourself in front of people, characters that sometimes you do not know or who give you only a few minutes to be able to take a picture of them.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true.”
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco, entitled "Flamenco - people", is exhibited at the El Fot<0xC3><0xB3>mata Gallery, located at number 20, rue de la Mata (street parallel to the Peupleraie d'Hercule) which will be open until October 16th.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is "true audacity"
The novel takes place in places no one knows about and deals with unknown subjects, but once again, Mario Vargas Llosa is determined to advance the new project he is working on, a novel whose main character is Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in the Congo and who went through the Amazon.
The Nobel Prize winner confessed yesterday at the Hay festival Segovia, that the novel that currently occupies him "is a real audacity" and that "everything shows that he should not write it".
“If I were reasonable, I would not do it, but I will do it and I hope to finish it,” he concluded in his speech at the festival of exchange of ideas and thoughts that for four days saw a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people parade through the city of the aqueduct.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was the most anticipated character of the third edition of this festival and fulfilled his contract.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award with the majority of the votes of the participants, made the Juan Bravo Theatre a sold-out venue.
The presenter of the Festival, Félix Romeo, found himself in front of a fascinated public who did not see the past hour during which the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with a great dose of humor, retraced the birth of his literary vocation, which is due to "his desire to read" and "to live new experiences"; how he wrote in a "very meth-like manner".
The Spanish-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if books change lives. "But I refuse to believe that literature is a pure fun, an ephemeral experience," stressed Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has effects" and "makes people less similar", because writers were asked "not to let themselves be.
Bad weather spoils the Pozoblanco fair
The festival of the banderillas that concluded the races of bulls of the fair of Pozoblanco was suspended yesterday morning, after the toreadors on horseback have verified that the arena was impassable.
In this way, the organizing committee, in agreement with Ferm<0xC3><0xAD>n Boh<0xC3><0xB3>rquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Léonard Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the bull race.
The bad weather raged on this fair, since finally two out of three parties could not take place.
On Saturday it was rain that prevented the celebration of the second planned bull race.
On the bill were José Luis Moreno, Curro D<0xC3><0xAD>az and Juan Bautista, who should have competed in the arena of Castilblanco
So only the Friday feast took place
On Friday, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut off three ears and was worn in triumph, after making arm movements in front of the bull with taste and aesthetics.
The same afternoon Alejandro Talavante concluded on two banners planted on the back of the bull and a severed ear that the uncovered bleachers applauded more than his fight in itself with the bull.
Even worse for El Juli, who entered the arenas of Los Llanos without pain or glory.
During his fight with the second bull, after a much better fight, he was whistled by most of the public.
Police control of a van in the province of <0xC3><0x81>lava: two thousand kilos of hashish found
Five o'clock minus ten in the morning.
Traffic control of the Basque Police (Ertzaintza) on the border of the Municipality of Armi<0xC3><0xB1><0xC3><0xB3>n (Alava).
The police officers arrest two occupants of a van and the latter two begin to escape.
Its cargo, more than two tons of hashish, enough to stop them.
The police pursued them and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man, identified as A.A.J., according to information released by the Department of the Interior of the Basque Government.
The arrested individual was charged with drug trafficking and falsification of documents.
The incident took place when various officials of the <0xC3><0x81>lava Traffic Unit were carrying out a vehicle control on the N-1, on the border of the Municipality of Armi<0xC3><0xB1><0xC3><0xB3>n.
They were about to stop a van to inspect it when the driver disobeyed orders, abruptly sped up and control began.
The police began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped two kilometers further on the side, where the two occupants descended to flee into a wooded area.
Basque police eventually arrested one of the two occupants and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were carrying and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The back of the vehicle was loaded with hash bales and then transferred to a police station for a thorough inspection and drug weighing.
In addition, the grievors found that the license plate had been "falsified" as it did not coincide with the license plate on the van, which is also why they charged the detainee with the crime of falsifying documents.
The Ertzaintza continues its investigation to arrest the other suspect, who managed to escape and to determine the provenance of the seized drug.
The detainee, A. A. J., 28, was taken into custody to carry out the various steps and will be tried within hours.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the influence of a drug
Actress Heather Locklear, the famous Amanda of the TV series Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the influence of a drug.
A witness saw her make strange maneuvers while trying to get out of her garage in Montecito, according to what a spokesperson for the California police patrol revealed to People magazine.
The witness said that at about 4:30 p.m., Locklear "pushed the accelerator hard, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the garage, and backing up several times, she rolled on her sunglasses."
Shortly after, the witness, who at first did not recognize the actress, saw that Locklear stopped in the middle of the highway and got out of his vehicle.
This person, at the time, called emergency services because “she was worried about Locklear’s life.”
When the police patrol arrived she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which was partially blocking the road.
"She looked disoriented," which is why officers took her to the center specializing in drugs and alcohol to perform a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and alcohol abuse was ruled out early on, although "according to the sight of police officers at first glance, we thought Locklear was under the influence of a drug."
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of a substance that was not specified and was incarcerated around 7 p.m. and released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear walked out of the Arizona clinic where she was being treated for a nervous breakdown.
Llamazares asked the Andalusian federation of the United Left to assume its responsibilities in the Silva case
The general coordinator and deputy of the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it is the regional federation to make a decision on the case of the former councilor of Youth and Sports of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of carrying out preferential treatment to members of his family.
"In these cases, I am very federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that will have to assume its responsibilities," Llamazares said regarding the behavior of the political party that he will have to adopt within the Seville City Council.
However, the leader of the United Left demanded that the investigations show "transparency" for the irregularities that Silva could have committed: "The United Left has always defended this type of case so that they have a maximum degree of transparency".
He also stressed that the political party has "very strict ethical codes for all civil servants".
"Sangre de Mayo", Garci's daring bet
Inspired by the stories of Benito Pérez Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s, José Luis Garci recreates the famous battle of the Spanish against the French in "Sangre de Mayo", which is the most ambitious film of his filmography with almost 15 million euros of budget.
The filmmaker has tried "to stage the many characters and illustrate the social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a at the head of the long list of actors.
The more than two-and-a-half-hour film, Sangre de Mayo, will be released in cinemas next Friday, which will then become a TV series for Telemadrid of more than four hours.
A great admirer of Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s's literature, José Luis Garci assures that he has achieved "a child's dream" with this shoot thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him, three years ago, to shoot a film commemorating the two hundredth anniversary of the 2nd of May in Madrid, something he has always accepted when the narrative was confined to national historical facts.
The 15 million euros provided by the Municipality of Madrid constitute for Garci a "unique opportunity" to reproduce with the appropriate scenery and clothing the atmosphere of "a Spain that was wrong leader for the fight, since, the struggle for independence led the people to rebellions under the reign of Ferdinand VII," he said.
But the filmmaker regrets that he did not get a financing like for the films "Captain Alatriste" or "The Ghosts of Goya" - more than double that obtained for "Sangre de Mayo" - because he could not shoot some scenes written in a script signed by Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he collaborated for almost his entire career.
The director of "Volver a empezar" has influenced his usual way of working, on the staging of the actors, with whom he is used to rehearsing before starting filming and to whom he does not cast, since it seems "humiliating" to him and considers that "the role of the filmmaker is to go to the theater and cinema to keep informed".
Many actors in "Sangre de Mayo" repeat in front of the camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larra<0xC3><0xB1>aga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Four-time Oscar nominee (he won one), Garci considers that the three nominees who represent Spain this year at the Hollywood Academy, "Sangre de Mayo," "Seven French Pool Tables" and finally the winner, "The Blind Sunflowers," are not representative of young Spanish cinema, "which deserves to be better known," he said.
With this film Garci does not expect a price.
“At first you think you’re working for posterity, then you realize you’re only working for prosperity, and now you’re just making one more movie,” says Garci after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabelle Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n takes on the role of the Sevillian dancer T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Valencia
A Sevillian dancer will pay tribute to a Sevillian dancer.
Carmen T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Valencia, the daughter of a Catalan father (Floren<0xC3><0xA7> T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Ferrer) and an Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district and at the age of three went to live in London with her family.
She was a free dance dancer and specialist in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, pioneering the liberation of women, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian and advocated the abolition of the corset which prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who marked the history of dance in Europe between the two wars, fascinated Isabelle Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n.
“I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she offered me to play the Sevillian dancer T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Valencia and it seemed incredible.”
According to the dancer, "we are not trying to tell her life but to translate her way of thinking.
The title of his dances made me think of flamenco.
Thus, "the butterfly dance" made me think of a Cuban folk dance and "the snake dance" to some tangos.
Her dancing was sensual and they told me that my way of dancing was identical to hers,” she says.
The staging was made thanks to two remarkable contributions: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing again Isabela in one of his shows, as he had done in "La puerta aberta"; and that of Professor Matilde Coral, who exceptionally well wanted to collaborate with the one who was his student.
"Matilde turns Tortola into a mature character.
I’m happy because she agreed to play a role in my work and it honors me.”
The staging was also thanks to the musical composition and guitars of Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Torres y Paco Arriaga, to the popular song of Michel Ortega, el Pulga y Moi de Mor<0xC3><0xB3>n; to the percussions of El Pájaro, as well as to the viola of Rafa El Viola and to the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who plays the role of this eternal companion".
This work also tells, in a way, the life of this woman who exhibited in such distant places, especially for the time, as in India, the United States, or Russia, but also throughout Europe, since she usually resided in London.
“I wanted to remember her because I think it is these women who have enormous influence in their time and now no one knows and highlights her work,” Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n says.
The show will begin at 8:30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega Theater
The publication of the "Journal of a recently married poet" concludes the Triennale
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Journal of a newly married poet" in the church of St. Stephen's in New York, where Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia to celebrate the anniversary of their Nobel Prize and the commemoration of the "Triennate Zenobia and Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n" (2006-2008), organized by the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia.
In this way, the "Zenobia and Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Triennale" comes to an end with the re-edition of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and with the travelling exhibition "Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez: This poplar of light" which was inaugurated last May and which, after traveling in the different Andalusian provinces of Spain, will go to New York.
Similarly, the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia has purchased eight hundred copies of the "Journal of a recently married poet", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to perpetuate the work of one of the best-known Andalusian poets.
America likes less without Paul Newman
Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them.”
This sentence is from the actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Absence of Malice", and illustrates the despair of American cinema, and of all America, in the face of the striking idea that Newman is no longer of this world.
It was hard to get an Oscar.
It hasn’t run since 2007.
Everyone knew he was sick.
It was a hard blow for everyone.
“Sometimes what one feels is beyond expression, and now I have lost a great friend,” cried Robert Redford, “my life and my country were better because of his existence.”
No one was afraid to be ridiculous or exaggerate.
One of the fathers of cinema and homeland died during a particularly dark period, when terrorists and stock markets are scary, the esteem of Americans has fallen very low, desperately seeking grounds for dignity.
When times are so hard and there is no reason to live, there is nothing left for human beings but admiration and it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
He embodied for everyone an ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the enemy of Richard Nixon and the defender of lost and defeated causes, such as the foundation for the fight against drugs created in honor of his elder deceased following an overdose and the creation of his own brand of organic food.
It was a victory for a country that struggled to prevail against a suicidal food culture.
This expansive wave of admiration swept through Hollywood with no regard for nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, found that no James Bond died before him.
Another Englishman, the Oscar-winning Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman marked the peak of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to name Newman as his greatest inspiration.
"He set the bar high for us," said George Clooney, who may be the only one today trying to break through the screen as Paul Newman did: being very honest and having a serious private life and away from goals.
It’s still not easy or possible in the media jungle these days.
But there is one who tries, and Paul Newman is an example.
After a divorce, he was married fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was faithful even if the opportunities were not lacking for him not to be.
“But why should I eat a hamburger out of my house, if I have a steak in my fridge?” he used to joke.
In heaven, he proudly attends the meeting of his daughters with his fans on earth, something that is not so usual in America.
“Among all the great roles he has played, he has never been as proud as that of the devoted husband, the loving father, the caring grandfather and philanthropist,” he says.
Madrid in the run-up to the 2016 Olympic Games
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid can organize Olympic Games, after the failure in 2012, it could come true in 2016.
But I wonder if we're ready.
If we take the example of yesterday's race: we are not!
They call it the perfect race, but in my opinion it was the worst race I have ever participated in.
If they had taken into account all the errors that had occurred during the race, these would have been the subject of a eliminatory note.
But let’s look at everything in detail and from the beginning.
The mistakes begin with the removal of the bibs, which forces you to go ahead.
This is not bad but if they make you move it would be better that they give you everything (including the electronic chip for racing).
Well, no.
They made you go there only to take the bib (first mistake, move only for that) and (after a long queue) surprise!, there was only the size 'S' for the jersey (second mistake, because I need a size XL)
What world do we live in?
Is it because of the crisis that they decided to buy only small jerseys with less fabric and therefore cheaper?
Well, this is nothing compared to what happened on race day.
Apart from the fact that you have to go very early to remove the electronic chip, the queue is 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave your backpack at the entrance.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, this is incomprehensible given that 11,000 people are expected for these races.
Since there was a long queue, the competitions started and we had not yet left our backpack at the entrance, although once done, the withdrawal was worse.
In addition, the rain accompanied the wait of more than 40 minutes during which rebellions and assaults of the barracks took place.
I believe that about 500 people will have pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like me, will not even be in the classification with the exact time, because of the chip they gave me which, I think, did not mark the start properly.
Of course, if they asked me to give an example of a perfect race, this one would not come to mind.
So I believe we can always dream of becoming the host city for the 2016 Olympic Games.
Microsoft is looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the conference on Emerging Technologies at MIT Microsoft was presented a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of Artificial Intelligence with little intelligence but able to perform some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to move around the company's campus) in response to what he was asked to do during a conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a face and shape recognition system, this “receptionist” can know how many people there are in the place, who they are – including remembering which positions they occupy – and listen to and hear the key words in their conversations.
But also group them according to conversation groups
In the video presentation, the receptionist detects a third person but she understands that she does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that she is not part of the company.
She asks if she is here to visit someone and she tells him that she will answer him in a few moments.
All without a blue screen.
Impressive.
But of course it represents the future.
Now the company has other things to focus on, for example on the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week we talked about a change in strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and it will no longer have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer discovered that if computers were sold with the indispensable instead of useless applications, they would go five times faster.
This represents a discovery since Microsoft, version after version, has not stopped adding functions and "extras" to Windows.
A change of strategy is welcome.
Microsoft is right, its operating system is losing importance but also its software.
When Google Chrome came onto the network, I was one of those who adhered to the theory that Google Chrome is Google’s first move to compete with Windows.
Several people have rightly pointed out that an Internet browser is not an operational system.
The operational system will always be necessary since it is the indispensable basis for computer hardware and software to understand each other.
It occupies the same function as your wife or husband when you have to say something to your stepmother.
It's true.
It will never disappear, but the "death" of the operational system must be seen not as an absolute truth but as a relative truth.
This week, Ballmer confirmed that idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system but more and more to the Internet browser.
We turn on the computer only to run Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and every day people spend more time browsing the Internet than browsing windows.
Who is responsible for half of the applications that come with the system?
Who can the most can the least.
And Windows 7 will need to contain fewer apps, far fewer than Vista.
Less heavy, cluttered month, less complex.
At the moment, Microsoft is more interested in launching its own online services so that they finally become an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, indeed, and I'll show you an example.
The photo in this article was taken earlier this month in one of Microsoft’s employee-only breakout rooms in Redmond.
On the beverage dispenser, a poster ask them to use their own search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, a study found that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search for information on the Internet.
Last week a delay occurred in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not be released in early 2009 but towards the end of 2009 or see in 2010.
Microsoft will surely try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 at the same time.
The phone, after all, looks more and more like a computer.
But the launch of Android is late and the iPhone is already on the market, it will cost them dearly.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio wore one in Edward Zwick's 'Blood Diamond', as did Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' and is part of the outfit of the Muscular Gays Association.
And if we begin to enumerate all his appearances, we could also mention this strong mustache who lifted weights in a traveling circus.
It's not just a simple men's bodysuit in cotton, tight and sleeveless.
The English call it 'tank' but the Fabulous Marcel of Brussels stands out among all the others.
First of all, by his flamboyant name - although he is known as 'Marcel' - which has to do with the sport since he takes the name, according to legend, of the boxer Marcel Cerdan, a lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
The 'Marcel' stands out from the rest by its excellent cotton, unisex cut, distinctive logo and the small Belgian flag (barely recognizable) that the best known bodysuits have in the neck.
But be careful, because the Belgian brand does not only produce tank tops.
But it also produces sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, babies, mini-shorts...
Clothes designed for the comfort of underwear.
Even if it is a pity to wear them only as underwear.
They have too much charm.
"I want to be a young mom; the candidate doesn't worry me"
His enormous resemblance to his sister did not prevent him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Currently the Cruz sisters take their new fashion business very seriously.
According to Monica, they are not just beautiful and famous girls who lend their name.
She was present at the promotion that the Mango brand did in Paris at its new headquarters but also at the presentation of the most important fashion awards that the Spanish house sponsors.
Monica is warm and shy.
Tell us about what you do in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I created for Mango for the new autumn-winter season, but also to attend the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the Opera dinner in honor of Valentino.
A very intense day but, at the same time, exciting, awaits us.
What is the basis of your new collection created for Mango for this fourth season?
The cinema of the 50s and 60s enchants us and we are inspired by it a lot for our collections.
I like to walk around the city and watch women to see how they are dressed, how they combine their clothes, I do it often.
Dancer, actress and cartoonist, you are a very versatile woman: right?
I think so, but in the end it all comes together and these activities have a lot in common.
Since I was a little girl, I liked clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother’s to look in my aunt’s closets and to see her clothes.
It was great, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, when I became a dancer, I always tried to take care of the way I dressed.
Dancers love to dress well for classes and tests, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress, when you put on the clothes, that's when you really put yourself in the character's shoes.
As a result, everything is linked.
You had it not long ago 30 years ago: was it hard for you?
I don't think so.
I feel better than ever, my 30s are cheering me up.
I find that the woman is more mature, has more experience and savors life with fewer problems.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I have done all the things I wanted to do since I was a little girl and it has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, you think you're gonna be a mom?
Of course, I want to become a mom because my body asks me to, and what’s more, I want to become a young mom; I don’t want to lose that.
As for the candidate, I’m not worried.
What I will do is give a lot of happiness to my son and raise him with a lot of love.
Let's go to the movies, you're waiting for the different movies you shot last year to come out.
That's right, I can't wait for them to come out.
I am a woman from the theater, I am very impatient and worried, I would like to have everything now but of course it is not possible.
I can't wait for the films 'La <0xC3><0xBA>ltima hora' and 'En busca de la tumba de Cristo' to come out.
Let's see what you think...
A few days ago you started on the catwalk with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Don't say that!
I didn't get on the catwalk to do the modeling.
Quite simply, Naomi Campbell called me, I’ve known her for quite some time, to invite me to participate in a charity parade in London for her women’s support association and the clothes we were exhibiting – I exhibited two clothes from our collection created for Mango – were being auctioned off to raise money for Naomi’s NGO.
People that Naomi is a person with a tender heart.
They say so many things about her, I know her, many things are not true.
Besides, this good side of Naomi fascinates me.
She asked me to parade for such a noble cause, but if she had asked me to do the pear tree, I would have done it anyway.
The important thing is to make life better for women in the third world.
Recidivists of alcohol at the wheel will have to install the 'alcolock' system
The Minister of the Interior wants the driver who has had more than three administrative sanctions for alcohol, to install in his vehicle a system that prevents starting the vehicle drunk, or if he does not blow.
The initiative was already announced last June and it now appears in the report of the Minister of State in which this initiative is considered as a pilot project that will last one year.
Its purpose is the reintegration of the driver by offering him road rehabilitation courses.
The Minister of State in charge of road safety but also the General Directorate of Road Safety and the Technological Institute for Automobile Safety Foundation will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists stopped for driving drunk more than once, take the car.
The alcoholock would avoid this since it is a system plugged into the vehicle that measures the level of alcohol in the breath and prevents the vehicle from starting if the driver does not blow before; or when the driver's alcohol level is higher than authorized.
Its cost is more than 1,000 euros and is the responsibility of the driver.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with this device reduced up to 65% of infringements in the first year of installation.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people every year.
This is due to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to deal with such behaviour before it becomes a criminal offence.
And facilitate its implementation, since the legal reform can be done by ordinary means but, nevertheless, the reform made by criminal means requires a reform of the organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial form, although some industrial and functional vehicles already have one on an experimental basis.
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on an initiative of the Spanish Socialist Party that proposes to install in school buses this system as has been done in France.
In Mexico without peep-toes
At 5:40 p.m., the official scheduled time, the plane of the Spanish Air Force in which the Princes of Asturias were traveling landed in the Presidential Hangar of the Benito Juárez Airport of Mexico City.
The sun was about to set but its rays still forced to put his hand as a visor to be able to see the royal couple get off the plane.
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities were present.
A few hours earlier I had asked the taxi driver on the street if he was aware that the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to complete their official trip.
- Ah, all right, so we can not go to the airport to pick up customers at this time... Are you from here or...?
- No, no sir, I'm Spanish but I lived here thinking two years.
- Ah, all right...
But the Mexican press knows very well who the Princes of Asturias are and knows the importance of the trip.
There are several waiting in the airport hangar near the red carpet and a military row consisting of 27 marines.
The Prince is smiling and dressed in navy blue, the Princess, when she, has hair in the wind, is dressed very soberly and does not wear her usual peep-toes; perhaps they had told her that a storm was threatening.
They make a brief stop with the photographers before passing in the room where the official procession awaits them.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four largest hotels in the city, a funny journalist from Mexican television awaits them.
The Most Prestigious Fashion Award
There is surely no more appropriate place in the world to present a fashion award than Paris and there is surely no living designer more extraordinary and good vivant than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the Bot<0xC3><0xB3>n-Mango Fashion Awards, in order to strengthen the international image of new fashion talents.
The winner will be rewarded with a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her models in the Mango window at 54 boulevard Haussmann in Paris and she almost cried with emotion.
Admittedly it is the second largest store of the brand in Europe that has just been inaugurated with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first shop is in London.
The events, as well as the desire to thank the designer Valentino, president of the jury of the contest, made us find ourselves in a luxurious dinner at the opera Garnier in Paris.
With the extraordinary Chagals family's table next to it, the presidential table prepared by Mango seemed even more spectacular.
Having big on the heart and doing against bad luck good heart, because of the recent death of his brother, Nati put on a garment of Mango and some adornments of ELAH, which cut the breath, and arm over, arm under with his son Luis - a handsome man almost two meters high - she accompanied Valentino to his dinner prepared in his honor.
Andik, the owner of Mango, a gallant man, as well as Baron de Rotchil ended the evening without a jacket because they had lent them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who showed up at the store with pants and a shirt – from her own collection – and who for dinner metamorphosed into wearing a sexy black long dress, was moved when during the night tour of the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us the hall of rehearsals of the ballets and remembering the good old days, she grabbed it.
Inés Sastre did not stay for the visit of the outbuildings of the palace, but she showed us before on her mobile phone photos of her son.
The next morning, we had the pleasure of seeing Olivier Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez – another handsome man who travels by motorcycle – and John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his sheets, towels and having asked beforehand, that there be no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh there, that's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are not only 1000 but 1001 ways to forget the chaos and frenzy of everyday life.
And to top it all off, they are all listed in a book that will bring relaxation to booksellers on September 30th.
The morning wake-up almost saddens us when it rings every morning at 7 o'clock, but it is even worse when we think of the restless rhythm that the current life imposes on us.
The office is synonymous with tension and the computer with back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are neither one nor two methods to combat daily fatigue and problems related to the world of work.
But 1001, not one more or one less.
Apart from yoga positions, classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott brings together in the pages of a book a whole 'menu' of methods adapted to the taste and time of each.
The anti-stress work is called '1001 Ways to Relax' and will arrive at the booksellers directly from the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is not possible to get peace of mind in places like work or through personal relationships, this ‘manual’ belies such a belief.
In addition, this manual offers other methods such as contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that help you relax.
If adrenaline isn’t running through your veins to restore your body’s balance and if stress has become an issue, it’s time to sit on the couch, disconnect from your mind, and focus on reading.
Talking while sleeping
Some children talk at night.
I am not referring to those who wake up very awake telling us something that happened the day before, but to children who talk in their sleep.
The first time it happens it may surprise you, but in reality it doesn’t matter.
This is a mild sleep disorder called somniloquy.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure there's more than one who talks at night.
This phenomenon can appear very sporadically (once in life for example associated with an episode of high fever), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the day after the child no longer remembers anything.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance.
They are often linked to other sleep disturbances such as nightmares, night terrors, bedwetting or sleepwalking, but this is not always the case.
As we have said before, they can also be associated with very high fevers, situations of stress or overexcitement.
In any case, it is a little-studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it occurs is also very variable.
It may be that he speaks with a quiet little voice, with isolated words, murmurs or on the contrary with cries, tears, long speeches ...
In the event that somniloquy becomes very common, it would be wise to observe the child and consult a specialist, to check if there is a problem that causes a lot of anxiety and in order to get an explanation for this problem.
We have said that this is a benign alteration, which is why there is no treatment, unless it is related to another sleep alteration that can be cured (for example, if it is related to sleep apnea or stress).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child before going to sleep.
Therefore look for quiet games and avoid programs or TV series that are more or less violent.
With children who are very nervous and have trouble relaxing, relaxation techniques can be used to help them calm down internally.
This will allow the child to have a more peaceful sleep.
As soon as sleepiness appears, try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will not remember what happened.
Useful tips
Don't wake him up.
It's useless since he's unconscious and you'd wake him up.
Even if he speaks, he sleeps and rests.
Remember that if he is very anxious several times, it is advisable to consult a doctor or check what causes so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is unusual), don’t be tempted to question him for information.
You will get nothing, because while sleeping, he is not conscious in order to organize his thought.
In addition, you will hear what he says, but you will not know what he is dreaming about, so pay attention to how you interpret the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Never tell the child that you can interrogate him at night to find out his secrets.
Not even joking.
This causes a lot of anxiety.
In conclusion, do not worry, this is nothing very bad, it is an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
Illhaeusern has finally found his way to victory on his field after a long period of drought.
Without making a big game, the Yellows and Blacks created the greatest number of opportunities and managed to turn one for the win of the game.
The pace was not very strong during this meeting where the attackers had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt of the visiting captain Kauffmann who brushed the skylight on a shot from a distance, Illhaeusern was going to take slightly the ascendant and turn by turn Fonderflick from afar, then with Hirn above, Romain from the tip of the foot or Diebold came to tickle the defense of Dannemarie.
In front, we were block in the middle of the field and just left the stirring Riahi at the tip of the attack.
The start of the second half was going to be decisive with first two chances signed by Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the score for the Illhousiens by Marais, well positioned to resume a rejected ball on a first attempt of Diebold (53').
But the goalkeeper Illhousiens will not be able to enjoy his happiness for long and will be forced to return to the locker room a dozen minutes later and thus leave his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not know how to take advantage of it and will not pose big problems to an Eleven illhousien who just stepped back a little to "compact" his defense, except in the very last seconds of the game where, after a big scuffle, the ball passed very close to the transverse.
Sarkozy to meet angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a detour through Brittany.
Faced with the demonstration of strength of the fishermen who have strongly disturbed Monday the accesses of several Breton and Norman ports, the president of the Republic has decided to go Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in the Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re, to meet their representatives.
They promised to welcome him "in a constructive spirit" and hope that he will "come up with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit that falls at the same time as a general assembly of the "crisis committee" created by the Breton fishermen to obtain measures against the soaring prices of diesel, which reached a record at more than 1.14 euros per liter on average.
According to the spokesman of the Elysée David Martinon, the president "will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their companies regain competitiveness and to secure the conditions of employment and remuneration of sailors".
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected by the fishermen.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out snail operations in Morbihan and Calvados, causing closures of nearly 10 km.
The marina of Quiberon was also blocked, but the links to Belle-<0xC3><0xAE>le did not stop.
A filter dam has been put in place on the Quiberon peninsula.
The sailors have already shown their determination Monday by burning, at dawn, tires and pallets in front of the fuel depots of the ports of Brest, and Lorient, while demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the English Channel, such as Les Sables d'Olonne, in the Vendée, where trawlers remained on the quay, or Le Havre, where some twenty boats blocked the movements of commercial vessels.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Croisic, in Loire-Atlantique, stopped in the evening the blockade of the important Total refinery of Donges.
Those in Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for Wednesday's meeting at the ministry to decide on possible actions.
At Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" must decide on Tuesday on the follow-up to the movement and its participation in the interview scheduled at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officials of the National Fisheries Committee, which has not supported their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen will not let anything go" and "do not wish to move to Paris", announced for example Liliane Cariou, the president of the committee of fisheries of Lorient.
The professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, currently pay about 50 cents per liter but they estimate that the break-even point of a boat is only reached with diesel less than 0.30 euro per liter.
Paul Newman The Magnificent
The Butch Cassidy and the Kid actor died of cancer at his home in Connecticut at the age of 83.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes welcomed the film legend and the committed actor, Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecast for 2008
The Brazilian planemaker is counting on 215 planes delivered this year despite the threats of recession that hang over the global economy.
The world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer, Embraer, is maintaining its 2008 delivery forecast with 215 aircraft delivered, its president Fredrico Fleury Curado said.
In the first half, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer expects a lot from the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft from the range of 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 aircraft to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG plans to sell more than 15 percent of its assets
The insurer American International Group, which U.S. monetary authorities have bailed out, plans to divest more than 15 percent of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion advanced to it, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is ready to study the sale of most of its business beyond its international life insurance and its retirement business in the United States, the newspaper said, citing sources close to the matter.
AIG's board of directors met on Sunday evening to consider possible divestments, according to the FT.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets AIG plans to divest include its aerial leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in reinsurer Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments.
No final decision has been taken on these divestments, the FT continues.
AIG must quickly raise cash to repay its $85 billion loan from the Federal Reserve at the risk of the U.S. taking 80 percent of its capital, diluting existing shareholders.
Analysis Paris History of the session Morning Meeting History of the session Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange suffered a historic fall on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected the Paulson plan to rescue banks: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a loss never seen approaching 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) plunged 777.68 points to 1O.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the largest drop in its history (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on September 17, 2001, the day of the resumption of trade after the terrorist attacks of September 11.
The technology-dominant Nasdaq dropped 199.61 points to 1,983.73 and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 8.81% (106.85 points) to 1,106.55 points, according to final closing figures.
Already depressed at the beginning of the session, Wall Street sank after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the plan to rescue the banks that was to restore some stability in the markets.
By 228 votes to 205, the representatives denied Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson the means he requested.
Nearly two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
"It's a bad signal to the market that Congress is unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
“It shows how much the market counted on this plan,” she added, fearing that a project adopted in several days would arrive “too late”.
“If the project is indeed moribund ... then the relay will be quickly passed to the Fed and other central banks to manage the crisis, which would further tighten credit conditions,” said Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight.
And further accentuating the sense of urgency, "every day that passes brings the downfall of a financial institution" in the United States, Piegza stressed.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, authorities organized the takeover of Wachovia’s banking business by rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated sharply, pushing for emergency interventions to benefit banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that markets are facing “not just a US crisis, but a global crisis,” the FTN Financial analyst added.
The bond market has risen sharply.
The 10-year Treasury yield fell to 3.632% from 3.827% on Friday night, and the 30-year yield to 4.161% from 4.357% the day before.
Obama, winner of the first televised duel
The first debate on Friday between the two candidates for the White House was followed by another to find out who, John McCain or Barack Obama, won.
Unsurprisingly, the Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed their own victory in this televised duel that would have been followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen says John McCain’s performance, while honorable, was not “brilliant” enough to stop his decline in polls five weeks before the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, whose opinion poll released on Saturday gave Obama a five-point lead (49% vs. 44% for McCain), says it was the Democrat who pulled out of the game.
Among the undecided voters, who are the ones who count, Obama was the winner for 39% of the respondents, while 25% of them give the victory to McCain, according to a CBS poll.
Obama should be able to confirm his lead Thursday with the expected good performance of his running mate, Joseph Biden, in the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
“It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
She has good instincts," Clinton said at the weekend.
The 70-year-old McCain has repeatedly highlighted his indisputable experience in foreign policy, while highlighting the "naivety" of his opponent on these issues that were at the heart of this first face-to-face.
“Senator Obama doesn’t seem to understand that...” he accused several times.
“I don’t believe Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to be president,” he said.
An angle of attack hammered since yesterday in the Republican television commercials.
Obama said he was the future.
Without breaking down, he was concise and precise.
He emphasized his ability to make the right decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
“McCain has still not understood, while Obama has,” retorted, this weekend, a Democratic spot reproaching the Republican for not having taken full measure of the impact of the crisis on the “American of the street”.
“During the 90-minute debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing to say about you,” Obama said, speaking to 20,000 people at an election rally in North Carolina in the pouring rain.
He didn’t even utter the words “middle class” or “workers.” The financial rout clearly benefits Obama, who is seen by Americans as the most likely to save the economy on the brink.
“The week ahead could be a watershed moment,” said influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic Rep. Rahm Emanuel, a former Clinton administration official, compared Obama’s “good economic instincts” to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
The current debacle is the final verdict of eight years of bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain.
Reaffirming that he would still be able to reduce taxes on 95% of Americans despite the upheavals of Wall Street, the Illinois senator also pointed out that the achievement of a possible energy independence of the country through the promotion of renewable energy was his first priority, with the establishment of a health insurance system.
McCain wanted to build 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Prudent, the two candidates dodged questions about the $700 billion ($470 billion) financial rescue plan passed by Congress last night and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "did you notice that there was an election, you?"
On Sunday evening, young people and opponents demonstrated in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject in advance the results of the legislative elections.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening at the close of polling stations in the central square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislative elections.
While no result had yet been announced, many young people had come to demonstrate against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko: "the dictator, resignation".
Some confess not to have even voted: "What good, since they will do what they want with my voice," says a young man.
They do not believe that the regime that has made a good impression on foreign observers with the aim of regaining its language with the European Union is ready to make a democratic turn.
Sanctions, including a visa ban for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of some assets, could be lifted if the elections were deemed clean by observers.
They were not, according to the opposition.
"We have been kept away from the electoral commissions and our observers have not been able to participate in the recount," said Yury Potemkin, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous grouping of twelve parties.
"This is a cosmetic change," said Alexander Milinkievich, a former candidate of the opposition in the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, "because the important thing is who counts the votes, and in our country, it is the executive power.
If opposition members enter parliament, they will have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament can mean space on television, meetings in the regions and proposed laws.
The opposition must therefore enter into the political game because "dialogue with the European Union must begin.
For if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, goes into crisis, and we do not reform, we risk becoming a protectorate of Russia.
We want to be independent.”
The opposition feared that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which had followed the electoral process, would recognize the validity of the vote.
She points out that the turnout figures seem too high, and that the generalization of advance voting (26% of voters in Minsk) has opened the voice to all manipulations.
"You noticed that there was an election, you?" asks the Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition MPs in parliament, the ones who are best suited to power.”
The silence of the night falls again on the October square.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Commission welcomed their success.
The Interview - Blood Made Safe Again
Yesterday, Héma-Québec celebrated the 10th anniversary of its founding, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, was right to rejoice, as Héma-Québec has become one of the safest and most effective blood providers in the world.
And above all, he regained the public’s trust that had been seriously shaken by the tainted blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, the national blood supply managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service was contaminated with acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C during the 1980s.
In the face of this tragedy and public outcry, in February 1994 the Government of Canada instituted a public inquiry, chaired by Justice Horace Krever, to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations to ensure that such a disaster would not happen again.
As Justice Krever was late in tabling his report, some provinces set up a committee to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau committee fulfilled this mandate.
As a result of the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Héma-Québec to serve Quebec and Canadian Blood Services to supply all the other provinces and two territories.
"In 1998, when Héma-Québec began its activities, only 38% of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec," recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was discouraging.
As a result of efforts to improve the safety of blood products and work in the field in the years that followed, we have regained the public's trust," she said before proudly stating that at the beginning of 2008, nearly 94% of the Quebec population now had confidence in Héma-Québec.
Dr. Décary, however, keeps in mind that “trust is something extremely fragile.”
Since its creation on September 28, 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, Europe was witnessing the outbreak of many cases of the human form of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says the one that has held the fort since its founding in 1998.
"And we didn't know at all if this disease could be transmitted by blood.
One of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports was that when it is not known and a serious illness may result, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterized by brain degeneration leading inevitably to death, exclusion measures are introduced.
In April 1999, the blood of those who had been in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980 was refused.
Now, a few years ago, it was proven beyond any doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood.
This episode has shown us that the precautionary principle that has been applied makes sense."
In 1999, a much more sensitive technique for HIV testing appeared on the market: nucleic acid tests (NAT) which make it possible to detect directly in the blood of donors the presence of the virus itself and not that of antibodies against the virus, on which the tests used until then were based.
The TANs have made it possible to shorten the silent period, which extends between the time when the person was infected and when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
This period could be reduced to less than a week.
This has substantially reduced the risk that some donors may be unknowingly infected and undetectable.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS through blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of receiving HIV-contaminated blood.
“In other words, it means that 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
As Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission by a blood product occurs.
I believe that today we can feel comfortable receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to regain health," says the CEO of Héma-Québec.
“Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen will emerge in the system.
As recently as last year, the Chikungunya virus appeared on Reunion Island, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
We must be constantly vigilant," continues Dr. Décary before stressing that in addition to a secure supply, Héma-Québec must also provide sufficient supply.
“Needs are increasing because the population is getting older.
Because cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need to be recharged with red blood cells or platelets.
The aging of the population also has consequences for the network of blood donors, which on average includes only 3% of Quebecers eligible for blood donation.
Any healthy person 18 years of age or older who meets the eligibility criteria can still donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14 per cent of people who offer their blood are not accepted, because they have AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have travelled to a country with malaria, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
"With this 3%, we are able to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Shortages are very rare.
But it is necessary to renew the members of this network of donors as they grow older and can no longer donate their blood.
However, it is difficult to convince people to donate their blood, but above all to retain them and encourage them to become a regular donor.
Today’s life being so unbridled, we rarely find the time to spend an hour giving blood,” says Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec provides not only blood products, but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that is almost exclusively used for the severely burned.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored at Héma-Québec, which also manages the only public cord blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord, which was once considered a biomedical waste, is full of blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"A few weeks ago, we celebrated the banking of our thousandth sample of cord blood and we plan to take more than a thousand per year.
We should start offering them for transplants early next year," says Dr. Décary, who describes this cord blood collection program as very popular.
"Several moms are disappointed that they cannot have access to it," because Héma-Québec does not have the means to offer this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Soccer - The Impact in the semi-final
The Montreal Impact qualified for the semifinal round of the USL First Division playoffs, thanks to a 3-1 (4-3 total goals) win over the Seattle Sounders yesterday in the second and decisive game of the quarterfinal series in total goals, at Stade Saputo.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of play.
After a goalless first half on both sides, midfielders David Testo and Rocco Plancentino scored the other goals for the Montreal team.
Roger Levesque was the only one to beat Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
In the first game of the series, Friday, the Impact suffered a 2-1 loss at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle.
The Impact will face the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semifinals.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunder closed a 3-1 deficit in the return game to win 4-3, but the Whitecaps still advanced to the semifinal round 5-4 with total goals.
The Impact is expected to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but details of the series will be confirmed today.
In brief - Kovalev's winning goal
The Canadian’s No. 1 trio is ready to kick off the season.
The team of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led the attack in a 3-2 shootout win against the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Centre.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec amassed two assists, and Kovalev picked up a pass in that win, the Habs’ fourth in six pre-season games.
Kovalev gave the victory by scoring the only goal of the shootout.
“I’m not ready yet,” the Russian said.
I need another game to feel comfortable.”
“He tried to do too much in the first half,” noted Guy Carbonneau.
I think he enjoyed the end of the game.
He got a nice ovation.”
Charest bet on the North
The Prime Minister does not rule out triggering elections before the end of the year
As soon as the general council of the Liberal Party was over, Jean Charest went yesterday to Jean-Talon, in Quebec City, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), is trying to get elected on the occasion of today's by-election.
"To push back the limits of our last great northern frontier": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force while remaining in the main lines, at the end of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, was projected a kind of image mill.
Spectacular shots of hydroelectric dams, mining, Quebec seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc. were looped on three huge screens.
Great means as in the election period.
At the press conference, the Prime Minister refused to rule out the possibility that he would call an election this fall, even though he noted that his schedule was very busy.
The "Plan Nord" is the fourth part of a "vision" that the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes a labour agreement with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory at the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North was "a jewel of immense potential", but did not give a deadline, investment amounts, or specific priority in future projects.
At most a few avenues of what could be further developed: notably hydroelectricity, the forest, but especially the mining sector, boosted by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamond," according to Charest's listing.
This "territory twice as big as France", "it's home, it's in Quebec.
Not only is it at home, but it is in us,” he insisted, as if to show that he was soliciting a national founding myth.
Quebec has built a lot in its relationship with the North, he said: the gold rush in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
“It’s up to us, it’s our future,” he added, after taking a theatrical break to contemplate the immense map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec territory, includes a portion of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the Prime Minister said at the press briefing.
“This is a traditional position that all governments have reiterated.
There is a border line on which there has not been an agreement for a very long time and, when the opportunity arises, I reiterate that position on behalf of the government," he said.
“With climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the North,” he said, referring to the Northwest Passage, which will open year-round due to melting ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that occupying the territory is a duty.
What about the people of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, especially young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former PQ MP from Ungava), have already begun consultations with some 30 communities.
An inter-ministerial committee chaired by Beno<0xC3><0xAE>t Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport et Ressources naturelles) has an important place has begun work.
The prime minister does not rule out a big meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a time when "we will give ourselves a common vision".
The development of the North would be carried out in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan will be "concerted, orderly and environmentally friendly," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as being in continuity with that of previous Liberal prime ministers.
“Like the Liberals who came before us, we thought differently to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.”
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began Friday with a large cocktail to mark the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage at the head of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Beauharnois Dam to the Adélard-Godbout Dam.
"From Godbout, who created Hydro-Québec, to Lesage, who made the Quiet Revolution and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, to Bourassa, who made James Bay, our party has forged the future," said Jean Charest.
In a press briefing, he invoked another conservative reference, the "Roads to the North" program of John Diefenbaker, prime minister from 1957 to 1963.
Addressing the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, Mr. Charest pointed out that it is scheduled for commissioning in 2012.
"It's still between us, but I plan to be there," he told his supporters, rousing a round of applause.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of triggering an election this fall, which the law allows him to do.
He points out that his schedule is filled, however, including a mission of the council of the federation in China and a Quebec-New York summit.
The weekend’s General Council provided the Liberal leader with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, including “constitutional aspirations” that have been passed off as a letter to the post office: the PLQ calls in particular for recognition of the “specificity of Quebec” in the Constitution.
He also hoped that Quebec would appoint members of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission and that they would have the right to veto decisions taken in Quebec.
On the opposition side, the broad outlines of the Plan Nord were met with scepticism.
The chief fisher, Pauline Marois, highlighted the Northern Quebec Development Policy that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the Liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, gave up applying it.
If he had done so, "we would be more advanced today," commented Ms. Marois alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (selection that takes place today), Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Mercure.
The QDA said it supported the government's adoption of a Plan Nord.
"But what we want is that it's not just a show," commented leader Sébastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who is back from vacation today.
Letters - A dishonoured country
It was Mr. Vic Toews, former minister of "Justice" (oh irony) in Harper's cabinet, who allowed himself last summer to say of Louise Arbour that she was a "shame" on Canada.
The opprobrium of this woman, who has fought tirelessly for justice and deserves our admiration, says as much about the Prime Minister's entourage as it does about Stephen Harper himself.
Here we are before a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, that has not repatriated its citizen locked up in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
A government that does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager at the time of the alleged acts.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, denies its word and allows a child soldier to languish in inhumane conditions.
The only one who relies on a travesty of justice to assess the guilt of the accused.
Recall, for the record, that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, among others, are advocating for the repatriation of Omar Khadr so that he receives a fair trial in Canada.
It is this same government that turns a blind eye to torture: it does not care that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, probably forever after so many years of abuse.
We don’t realize it yet, but we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our “democracy,” the word that Harper never ceases to wield and that sounds so hollow in his mouth.
The time has come when morality no longer exists: it is possible to abuse, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen at the whim of a hitherto minority head of government (what will happen after October 14...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that advocates Virtue, Law and Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what made the reputation and dignity of our country.
Shame, Mr. Toews, it is there, in this renunciation, and not elsewhere.
The Orwellian Discourse of Barrick Gold
In its September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Executive Vice-President of Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Pursuing an Orwellian logic, it claims that the world’s largest gold company filed a six-million-dollar defamation suit against three authors and a small penniless publishing house in order to launch a “transparent public debate.”
While it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of defamation proceedings, but the law.
Unsurprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely obscured by Mr. Garver.
Because, for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to bring to ruin anyone who dares to support a position contrary to his?
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the authors and publisher of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defense and fight, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by the almost bottomless pockets of the mine.
The tactic, in these unequal struggles, is often to ruin the defendants in order to impose an amicable settlement that will gag the opposition in addition to scaring anyone who dares to look at the issue again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was in front of public opinion that she should have presented her view of the facts.
Unlike in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada are normally held by the exchange of ideas and not by truncheons.
It was therefore enough for the mine to open its books, its files and to establish a real debate, through newspapers, the media, publications and the funding of independent research teams that could have shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold appears to distrust public opinion and dismisses petitions and letters of support for Black Canada's authors.
Perhaps Mr Garver could explain how he can at the same time call for a "public" debate while despising the views of that same public?
In the world of the vice-president, it seems that this word refers only to high-paid lawyers and not to all Canadians; this is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In a democracy, even detractors have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - is that the public that supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada does so primarily because they reject the brutal way of mining.
This public is ready to hear Barrick and to judge, but on the basis of civilized exchanges of arguments, and not in the context of what many perceive as a gag suit (pursuing the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just filed a formal notice against the authors of Black Canada ordering them to stop using this term...).
Beyond Mr. Garver’s surreal speech, Barrick Gold’s prosecution is a direct attack on the freedom of academic research and the quest for truth that are essential to any democratic society.
It denies, en bloc, the right to citation from credible sources and to debate on facts and interpretations, which represent the very basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss matters that the rich companies of this world do not like in a country like Canada, under penalty of repeated prosecution, who will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Black Canada.
She has a right of reply.
The academic community, to which we belong, has a long history of managing debates and disagreements and resolving conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s disproportionate prosecution makes it clear that, contrary to what she claims, she has no desire for a transparent debate.
This is a loss to the academic world, as it is to public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place measures to limit this kind of abusive prosecution.
Wall Street rescue operation - Democrats and Republicans agree
The Bush administration and congressional leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the largest economic bailout since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan to curb the financial crisis that has rocked Wall Street for months has yet to be endorsed by both houses of Congress.
In particular, it provides for better control by elected officials of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of public money committed, new provisions to contain the number of houses seized for non-payment, as well as a right of control over the salaries paid to the leaders of the rescued companies.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Republican Representative at the negotiating table Senator Judd Gregg announced the good news minutes after midnight yesterday, after a two-day marathon of negotiations.
"We have made great progress toward an agreement that will be effective in the marketplace," Bush administration spokesman Henry Paulson said.
“Everything has been done to shield the real economy and ordinary Americans from the ongoing crisis on Wall Street,” she said.
“This is the bottom line: If we don’t do this, the trauma, chaos and disruption to Americans’ daily lives will be immense,” Gregg said.
Negotiations had turned to the sprint in recent hours for fear of the effect that a new failure would cause on the mood of investors.
The deadline we had agreed upon was the opening of the markets this morning.
Belatedly associated with the negotiations, the two candidates in the US presidential election have been rather supportive of the agreement, without failing to express their dissatisfaction that we are forced to reach this extreme.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has attributed the addition of certain provisions to the agreement, including that to allow owners to keep their homes and that on the salary of leaders of companies rescued by the state.
“When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is no reason to be happy.
But these measures are necessary," he said on US television.
Asked on another channel if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied: “I’d like to see the details, but I hope so.”
“The broad outlines I’ve read [show] that this is something we’re all going to have to digest and with which we’re going to be able to move forward.
The option of doing nothing is simply not acceptable,” he said.
The $700 billion plan aims to buy back with taxpayers’ money the dubious, risky and unsaleable claims of U.S. financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis triggered by the bursting of a real estate bubble that first led to the collapse of risky mortgage loans (subprimes) before expanding to other more widespread forms of credit securities (PCAA) and resulting in a liquidity freeze and the disbandment of banks and institutions.
It was a group of elected Republicans who overturned the first draft agreement last week.
It is believed to have emerged from this impasse since Democrats accepted that some of the troubled companies’ “toxic” assets were only insured by the government, rather than purchased.
In order to round out the angles for everyone in Congress, a provision was also added that if the government were to assume losses for five years with this program, it could put in place new taxes to help it recover its stake.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first tranche of 250 billion to which another 100 billion can be added if the president deems it necessary.
The payment of another $350 billion is expected to be endorsed by another vote in Congress.
In exchange for its help, Washington will get stakes in the rescued companies that will earn it dividends in case of profit and that it can resell when the turmoil has passed.
The federal government will have the opportunity to delay foreclosure procedures for housing attached to the real estate loans covered by this plan, as well as to set limits on compensation and severance pay paid to executives of affected businesses.
The architects of the plan would like to see it submitted to the vote of the House of Representatives today, and to that of the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will be given the go-ahead.
Indeed, voices continued to be raised yesterday against this project, both in the Republican and Democratic camps.
“Obviously, Washington doesn’t hear you,” House Finance Committee member Scott Garrett told his constituents.
“Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one that benefits taxpayers.”
The leader of a small group in Congress known as the “Skeptics’ Caucus,” Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.) presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred prominent economics professors, including three Nobel laureates, have written to us to tell us: Congress is being asked not to rush and to carefully consider the way forward,” he said.
At the same time, in Europe, we once again had proof of the global nature of the crisis.
At the end of an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion US).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been made necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas said it was giving up on acquiring its competitor in the midst of shipwreck since it lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion US) in the crisis of risky real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of Europe’s 20 largest banks and 10 largest insurers.
"This is not money lost," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said.
In exchange, we get a voting right in the bank and influence.
This is precisely something that savers and households appreciate now that the times are looking uncertain."
Meanwhile, on the other side of the Channel, the British government seemed on track to nationalize another bank battered by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all the loans outstanding at the Bradford and Bringley bank, including more than 41 billion (75.5 billion US) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander said yesterday that it would buy the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government should nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a committed icon
Her beauty in the eyes of azure was for a long time her trump card, some will say her weakness.
Had he freed himself from the narcissistic mirror, the American actor with the charming smile?
Yes and no.
His modesty, sensitivity and a talent that flowed from the source will also have moved him away from the power register that gives birth to the true sacred monsters.
What a great runner!
Paul Newman, who died Friday at the age of 83 from lung cancer on his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of American cinema in his heyday.
Less monumental than Brando, to whom he resembled and of whom he was for a long time a sort of rival on the screen, more cautious in his play, certainly more fragile, but also apostle of freedom and the shattering of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often makes beautiful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, to a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother of origin.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without excessive ego, ultimate mark of quality.
For in him projected a whole country in love with the self-made man, the fighter of the war of the Pacific, wounded in combat, who in the early 50 studied the dramatic art at Yale then attended the Actor's Studio in New York, before triumphing in the theater, on television, soon in the cinema.
The same man who campaigned for civil rights was also the driver who finished second at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1979, dubbed a sex symbol, although a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
Also disappear with him the shadowy areas of this secret star, discreet, committed, allergic to the shrapnel of show business, whose enigma we will not have quite pierced.
An honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
The disappearance of Paul Newman has made moviegoers dizzy this weekend, as his big roles collide on the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of a seventh American art in perpetual mutation parades through it.
The charming cowboy from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man rejecting his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on a Hot Roof adapted from Tennessee Williams in 1958, comes back to haunt.
Closer to home (1990), we recall his sensitive Mr. Bridge, troubled in his old age by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
So many other Paul Newmans have gone down in history.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Likes Me, by Robert Wise, a role intended for James Dean, resumed after his death, which really launched Newman in 1956.
This friendly thug in the brilliant The Sting (The Scam), Oscar for best film in 1973.
A bitter and vengeful billiard player in Robert Rossen’s magnificent The Hustler (1961), he will reprise the character on the return in Martin Scorsese’s The Color of Money, which earned him in 1987 his only Oscar out of nine nominations.
That face through the ages was him.
It's him again.
The eras are jostling through its path.
Young people know him mainly through the cult Slap Shot of George Roy Hill (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in The Coen Brothers' The Hudsucker Proxy.
With a final role as godfather of the Irish mafia in Sam Mendes’ Road to Perdition in 2003, the loop was closed.
Contrary to several film legends who dropped the profession early enough, Newman will have remained in the saddle for a long time, while denouncing Hollywood, its gold, its pomp and its concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, not without humor, "as a living challenge to "underplaying" judging his performances too supported.
The profession has not always been tender for the beautiful Paul Newman to whom the roles fell for a long time cooked in the beak.
However, he played less often the first youth than the marginal ones: neurotics, alcoholics, bastards or desperate, whose perfect features reflected the drifts and revolts.
As a director, Newman revealed little-known facets of his true modest sensibility.
Her Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (based on the novel by Canadian author Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the title role, painted a fine female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott by overdose dedicated his film Harry and Son in 1984, a work of modesty and sadness.
Among the shower of tributes that poured yesterday on Newman, his great friend and former comrade-in-arms Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, very saddened: "His presence has made my life and this country better."
Generosity, love of existence are vibrant traits of the missing actor.
Beyond his legendary career, he is also a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a protester of Hollywood excesses.
We will have seen a lot of his well-wisher enthroned on jars of dressing, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging the process to be rather bad taste, although gag at first.
The profits from these sales were nevertheless paid to his Foundation for Children in Difficulty.
Newman, rather than sit on his myth, will have committed himself to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these phrases: "Always and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there.”
And a privilege for us to have followed the path of such a lucid and generous American artist.
Model citizen, in short and in addition.
What could Zuschlag & Company do in their invoice factory?
Soon, on 8 October, the hearings relating to the ongoing criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his accomplices will begin.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of fraud, in the form of criminal organization, on a permanent and regular basis, having caused particularly significant damage. Other charges have been held against them, such as forgery and use of forgery.
According to the public prosecutor's office, the money from subsidies was spent for personal purposes, while the benefits were justified by false invoices.
The money of the state and the municipalities, about 65 million HUF in total, went on the one hand into the coffers of the Fiatal Baloldal movement and on the other hand into the pockets of some people.
Their method, also made public by the investigating authorities, was to receive the money from grants obtained by issuing expense invoices, behind which no actual benefit was provided and thus the associations never met their commitments.
According to the indictment, a large portion of the invoices were false.
For the latter, they obtained invoice books at the market of J<0xC3><0xB3>zsefváros, while they manufactured the stamps in Kiskunhalas.
For the names of companies that were to appear on the invoices, it was decided, inter alia, during the tours of the Northern Province of Lake Balaton, carried out by István Lados, at the request of János Zuschlag.
According to the latter's testimony, he had to locate pensions and restaurants.
For his personal consumption, he asked for an invoice, on the model of which they made the other invoices that they were going to introduce, among others, with the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the Municipality of the Capital to access subsidies.
The majority of the invoices were created by István Lados and his accomplice András <0xC5><0x90>ri, who, according to our information, was mainly responsible for drafting the files necessary to obtain the subsidies.
During a "spotting circuit", one of Lados' choices was a bistro.
According to the two invoices issued by the Zuschlag in 2003, this place has ensured the restoration of a group of 90 people, members of the association Biztos Pont Egyes<0xC3><0xBC>let.
However, according to the manager, it would have been impossible for so many people to occupy this place at the same time.
In the same way, in the summer of 2002, the invoice drawn up in the name of the Jobb J<0xC3><0xB6>v<0xC5><0x91>ért Foundation, which would later bear the name of Egy<0xC3><0xBC>tt a Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért, was riddled with errors of form and substance.
A pension, located in Badacsonytomaj, actually had only three rooms, and a maximum of ten people could spend the night there, yet the bill mentioned one hundred and thirty customers.
The issuers of invoices with an overflowing imagination also fell into excess, when they mentioned the company Pigal Kft, also belonging to the Horeca sector. In their accounts, neither the name of Jobb J<0xC3><0xB6>v<0xC5><0x91>ért, nor that of the Hoppá did not appear, according to the information given to the prosecutor's office.
Gy<0xC5><0x91>z<0xC5><0x91> Farkas, the company's manager, told hvg.hu that when the prosecutor summoned him and showed him the invoices, he knew, right away, that they were fake documents.
“The name of our company and our tax number were placed in the wrong place on the stamp.”
He added: "Beyond the form, the fact that according to the invoice, a hundred people stayed there, did not fit either, since this establishment has only eleven rooms, which do not have as much space.
In addition, the bill also mentions meals, and our restaurant has been closed for a long time."
The issuers of zealous invoices also did not inquire about the Budapest travel agencies, which are part of their choice, but only organize trips abroad. Thus, naively, they indicated stays in Hungary on invoices to be paid in cash, which also goes against the accounting practices of the agency.
In addition, as it appeared during the investigation, they also added VAT on these documents, while the services concerning travel activities, whose destination is outside the European Union, are charged without VAT.
Similarly, the VAT rate of the four invoices drawn up in the name of the Hotel Revf<0xC3><0xBC>l<0xC3><0xB6>p on behalf of Jobb J<0xC3><0xB6>v<0xC5><0x91>ért was incorrect, since the company's services do not bear a VAT of 25% as indicated, but a VAT of 15%.
The public prosecutor's investigation reveals that the "issuers" also made errors in mentioning as a service the transport of goods by road, which the company issuing the invoices could not exercise, given that its profile was investment advice.
In addition, it is also for defects of form, such as types of inadequate invoices and false stamps, that the invoices issued to the order of Egy<0xC3><0xBC>tt a Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tvány, XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyes<0xC3><0xBC>let and Biztos Pont turned out to be false.
Just as in the case of the Ravenna Bt. company or the Kunfehért<0xC3><0xB3> sports camp, both of whom deny being the authors of the invoices issued on their behalf.
The forgers also did not pay attention to the fact that the company HIB Kft., established in Ny<0xC3><0xAD>regyháza, was in liquidation at the time (in 2001) the group of Fiatal Városért Egyes<0xC3><0xBC>let was supposed to have a meal at their home.
Invoices deliberately drawn up
Another category of invoice issuers is those who were fully aware that they were being asked to issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tvány Foundation, at the request of the Fiatal Baloldal group - Ifj<0xC3><0xBA> Szocialisták, has prepared an invoice for the order of the Egy<0xC3><0xBC>tt Foundation in Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért, for a sum of four million HUF.
According to the indictment, the manager of the company Collab Kft. was led to issue false invoices by one of the accused, Ludovic Gy<0xC3><0xB6>rfi.
Similarly, it has cooperated with the Zuschlags, the company Biogate Kft., which is currently under liquidation and which in 2003 issued invoices to the order of the Jobb J<0xC3><0xB6>v<0xC5><0x91>ért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tvány Foundation, the Atlasz Egyes<0xC3><0xBC>let Association which provided no UF and the V<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>sfeny<0xC5><0x91> Egyes<0xC3><0xBC>let Association, for an amount of approximately H5 million.
No financial movement took place, either, as the invoices issued were subsequently cancelled, but this, the agencies avoided mentioning it in their accounting.
The following category of companies issuing invoices is that of companies directly related to the accused.
Thus, the administrative delegate of the general manager of the company Delta Tri<0xC3><0xB3> Kft., dealing with the trade in fuel and motor vehicles, whose head office was in Budapest, but where he could not be found, was Iván Kubatov.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices for the sale of IT equipment, amounting to approximately HUF 18 million.
According to the investigation, the equipment was purchased by Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which had been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The director of this company was a man of Romanian origin, to whom Ivan Kubatov also sent documents related to the company, between 2002 and 2005.
As far as we know, Kubatov admitted during the investigation that he issued invoices to the order of the companies Atlasz, Hoppá and Egy<0xC3><0xBC>tt to Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tvány, and that he pocketed their value.
It was precisely at the request of Ivan Kubatov that Romanian masons created the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In reality, none of these companies were operating, which the accused explains by the fact that they were not receiving work.
He still used these companies, since at the request of Master Zsolt Szente, co-accused as well as editor of the founding documents of the companies, he drew up invoices in their names, in the order of associations relating to Zuschlag, such as the associations Atlasz and Y-Generáci<0xC3><0xB3>.
Kubatov gave 15 invoices to organizations, issued by Cash Investment, Delta Tri<0xC3><0xB3>, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, for a value of HUF 14.2 million.
The prosecutor’s office believed that 10% of the amounts indicated on the invoices as well as VAT went into Kubatov’s pocket.
The man even used the company Szi-Beri Bt. to draw up fictitious invoices that were used as part of the Biztos Pont grant application.
In January 2006, the Y-Generáci<0xC3><0xB3> Association and Sz<0xC3><0xB6>vetség a Modern Magyarországért submitted an application for a grant to the Socialist Party's public utility, Táncsics Mihály Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tvány (TMA).
They obtained this subsidy for an amount of twice 500,000 HUF, but these amounts were not used for the purposes indicated in the application.
To prevent this from being known, five fictitious invoices received from the company Works Team Kft. were presented to the TMA.
Moreover, it was these invoices that were found during the search carried out in the office of <0xC3><0x81>rpád Kemecsei, at the Ministry of Education.
During the hearing, some of the accused will report on the method of making the invoices, as they had previously done before the prosecutor's office.
What could be really interesting would be that the main defendant, János Zuschlag himself, decides to lift the veil on the whole story.
So far, his confessions are not very detailed, and although he has repeatedly promised to tell the smallest details, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest, or, possibly, the socialists would have reached an agreement that in exchange for the repayment of a large part of the fifty million HUF, Zusi would wear the hat alone.
Today, the latter is probably vexed, since the requests for his placement in house arrest, on the basis of a relief of his conditions of detention, continually fall into the ear of a deaf person.
While those who have caused much greater damage, and the perpetrators of unreparable economic crimes, walk freely or at least, wait in their own homes for the end of the procedure. He does not have this possibility.
The psychology of auctioneering: why do we spend more money?
At auctions, buyers tend to spend more, and overestimate the merchandise.
Researchers in neurology and economics at New York University have succeeded in updating the neurological and economic underpinnings of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to their study published in the journal Science, human beings do not want to be distanced during this type of competition, such as an auction on eBay, and that is why they even prefer to pay too high a price.
This research attempted to draw a neurological picture of this kind of "game" using experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers played lotto, while the other group took part in a fun auction, while using a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) method, the researchers analyzed the active brain domains of the experimental subjects.
In both games, participants could earn money, but during the auction, an essential element of which is the over-bid of a third, the whole located under the brain stem, called striatum, moved intensively during the loss of the game.
This part of the brain, along with several other functions, plays a role in the “self-stimulation” mechanism of the nervous system.
That is why, according to the researchers, the rise in prices is explained by the flight in the face of the violent reaction of the striatum.
In support of their theories, the economist members of this group of researchers pursued financial surveillance analyses.
In these, three groups outbid a partner in a variety of circumstances.
They simply informed the control group of the actual value of the product in question, and they thus placed them.
To another group, they promised that if, in addition, they came out the winner of the game, then they would receive an additional 15 dollars, as a reward.
While the third group received that $15 before the auction, the group members also lost that money, in case they lost the auction.
The difference between these two groups is in fact that the emphasis in one was on victory, while in the other, on failure.
By thus proving the neurologists' hypothesis, the members of the team of players "against failure" were willing to higher stakes than those made by the control group and the group "for victory".
“These results cannot be demonstrated by any existing economic theory.
Indeed, each of them explained the phenomena observed during auctions only by the pleasure of winning and the parade before the risk.
Only neurological imaging methods have helped to remove the contradiction between the two theories, leading now to a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, a professor at New York University's School of Economics.
Hepatitis: when should we consult a doctor?
Worldwide, about half a billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary, chronic liver disease is mentioned among the leading causes of death.
It is estimated that one hundred thousand people are infected with the hepatitis virus in Hungary, but only seven thousand people receive treatment, which is due to the fact that patients often do not know that they are infected with the virus.
The name hepatitis is a generic name given to infections affecting the liver and caused by different viruses.
There are many similarities between their symptoms. Inflammation of the liver and jaundice are characteristic, but the pathogens and diseases generated differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses, depending on the pathogenic genes, spread mainly in two forms: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (for example: contaminated food or water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses through blood and body fluids (sperm, vaginal secretion, saliva).
For travelers, it is recommended to get vaccinated against viruses A and B. There is no vaccine against C.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after consumption of contaminated food, usually accompanied by poor general condition, weakness, upset stomach and nausea.
Then develops on the skin and on the white of the eye a visible jaundice, the stools become lighter and the urine takes a darker color. Healing can take two to three weeks.
Around the world, every year, one million people die from the most serious form of this disease, such as cancer or cirrhosis of the liver caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only one in ten patients receives medical treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: if left untreated, it can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most patients do not know that they have the virus because the pathogenic gene sneakily destroys liver cells. In many cases, the first symptoms appear only after 20 to 30 years.
Therefore, early prevention is very important, as well as regular screening tests.
The contamination is much higher than average among a population of three groups: people who had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug users and tattooed people.
Currently, there are 200 million chronic hepatitis C patients worldwide.
Since the disease can be detected by a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to consult your doctor as soon as symptoms of unknown origin are observed.
The disease can be cured, if it is detected in time. The virus can be eradicated from the body, in this way the risk of contagion disappears and the development of cancer is prevented.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, first organized in 2004 by organizations representing patients from around the world.
Its aim is to draw attention to chronic cirrhosis of the liver, caused by viruses, the causes of its development and the importance of early diagnosis of the disease.
Does one who believes in God feel less pain?
According to the results of recent research, religious belief would work as a kind of analgesic, which would have already helped to make the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
The British newspaper Telegraph published an article in which researchers from the University of Oxford carried out an interesting experiment by analysing the degree to which belief in God can influence the human being’s tolerance to pain.
As part of this bizarre experiment, 12 Catholic believers and as many atheists were subjected to electric shocks, while each of them observed a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude much of the suffering.
Thanks to a technique of palpation of the human brain, it was also discovered that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain responsible for the regulation of pain.
This analysis is the first in a series of experiments, in which academics, scholars, philosophers and theologians participate from different sectors of the university.
More precisely, the experiment proceeds as follows: an instrument emitting sparks and diffusing the electroshocks is fixed on the left hand of the experimental subject.
The researchers asked the participants of the experiment to steadily look at two paintings, one being the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and the other, the Lady with the Hermine painted by Leonardo da Vinci in the 15th century.
The researchers behind this experiment hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary evoked a kind of state of faith among believers, while the choice of Da Vinci’s painting, not very different from the first, focused on its soothing effect.
The experimental subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and during that time, they received 20 four-part electroshocks in succession, while looking at either the religious-themed painting or the more general-themed painting.
The Catholics said that in the sight of the Virgin Mary, they felt as if they were "safe", as someone who was "taken care of" and they "calmed down, and peace invaded them".
At the sight of the painting of religious theme, they reported 12% less pain than when they looked at the work of Leonardo.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself took part in the experiment, thinks that one can achieve the same effects with any other strong image, in atheists, provided one finds the appropriate photo.
"We should find an image in front of which they react very positively, such as a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
“The practice of faith should change, and in many cases, it actually changes our personality,” Wright said.
After these excellent results, there remains only the question of what would be the effect on the regulation of the pain of the subjects if believers were shown a Madonna painted by Leonardo or by a painter of the same caliber?
Would seeing a better quality Virgin Mary cause better results?
You are what you divulge about yourself
On the occasion of its tenth anniversary, Google says that it can be found in the back of people's pockets just like the sky above their heads. It knows where they spent their holidays, which specialists they consult and what their interests are.
That's not enough yet, according to Eric Schmidt, who is one of society's most influential people.
As for the skeptics who draw parallels to Orwell’s horror vision, they don’t see the essence of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google’s main ambition is to gather even more information about its users. This is necessary so that Google’s founders can meet their original goal which sounded like: “Let’s collect all the information in the world in one system!”.
According to the Google executive interviewed, after ten years of a work of global upheaval, they are still only at the beginning of their goals to be able to process all the information.
To the question: what will happen in five years? Schmidt replied that he would like Google to be able to answer questions such as "What could I do tomorrow?" or "Which job would suit me best?". However, software will only be able to answer this kind of question, simple at first glance, when they know enough about users.
It is not perfectly clear to all Internet users that the words used during internet searches, the IP address of the computer that initiates the search and the pages subsequently consulted by the interested persons are precisely listed.
Through the Personalized Search program launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own search history and can view what they searched for, what they clicked on. Thanks to this, in the long run, Recommendations, program based on the same logic, will be able to give much more personalized answers, and we will submit products and services based on our previous statements.
What happens if someone uses my data against me, if they look at what my work is? ask users, who are worried about Google's monopoly of information.
In most cases, it is the potential power represented by society that can arouse fear, and it is not remorse, the fear of punishment, the desire for freedom or possibly the revolt against power that can arouse a counter-reaction in Internet users.
It is, however, a confirmed fact that the terms sought are not only recorded, but in justified cases, they are transmitted to a third party, and in this kind of legal case, nothing protects the personal rights of Internet users.
Probably the most resounding example of recent times is the coordinated action against Brazilian paedophiles, during which Google transmitted to the Brazilian government the information it had collected on the public page called Orkut, thus allowing an identification.
Human rights-minded Internet users were able to breathe a sigh of relief last May, when Google, arm in arm with the electronic legal protection agency EFF, proved its right in court against the FBI. According to the judgment rendered, in the future, Google will still not be obliged by any of the points of the constitution to disclose information about the secret request of the FBI, of whatever nature.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully obtained some 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms that it had won in relation to the strengthening of the Child Protection Act, passed several years earlier, but ultimately failed to obtain the private users' search lists, nor the entire list of websites and keywords of the past two months.)
Google's judgment is therefore quite contradictory: it is castigated by those who fear the transmission of their personal data, because they think that their intimate sphere and their private domain suffer from it when they begin to use Google services. Therefore, they attack them in the spirit of revolt that is manifested against multinational companies proud of their conservative image.
Meanwhile, America’s geek culture and its “wildmen” of computer enthusiasts, activists, and enthusiastic users who pop up in many countries see Google as the next generation of big business, the “connected corporation,” as opposed to its rival, Microsoft, which is branded as the world’s invader because of Windows, even as they both fight for the same goal.
This can be explained by the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for identification code, does not ask for money for its applications. The documentary code and the package of programs, continually refreshed, has a much more accessible, younger and cooler effect, facing the practice of the official giant of the software.
The reason may also be that geeks see very accurately the problematic relationship between human rights and the internet, and what web 2.0, the most proclaimed keyword of recent years, pulls right behind it.
Indeed, web 2.0 is about nothing other than collaboration, the fact that we intentionally leave traces behind us, and that we use the communication channels made available to us, and while the dimension of these changes one by one, the essential remains the same: we expose ourselves.
A young person, in general, can keep a profile on several public pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and he can even link these to other services, such as Twinter, or last.fm, listing his musical habits. Then, he can link these to a tracking system, such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. These young people can also keep blogs, in which they automatically appear their most recent
While we can see many examples, such as that of the girlfriend who easily understands at the sight of the morning photos, taken by the circle of common friends, with whom his unfaithful friend spent the evening, or that of the company that fired one of its employees, just for the sincere opinions that this one has written on his blog about top management, we can be on one thing:
The one who lives an online life is made up of what he shows of himself, and this is how we can define the principle hiding behind the behavior of young people today.
The one who wants to hide something, or at least wants to try to circumvent Google’s monopoly, can do so (starting, for example, with Scroogle, using the Google search system, but, at the same time, intentionally leaving no trace).
The number of people who deliberately do not register on public pages so that it is not possible to find them, is not the least. Google online services, through text processing to image processing, reading information can be replaced by alternative versions, which are not linked to our profile, do not have this huge fleet of servers and which do not have a lot of features.
Public opinion is waiting, without really hiding it, for the moment when Google will reveal its true nature.
The company, with its current value of $156 billion, is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion).AdWords/AdSense advertising domains threaten the revenue of advertising agencies, while services introduced at an increasing speed cause serious headaches not only to Microsoft, but to many other creators.
However, the critical observers thus find, besides all this, contradictions with worrying effects: for example, the top management of the company has refused, in its entirety, the protests of the employees, after it has doubled the price of the business kindergarten and after the company has judged too onerous the Chinese multi-purpose daily restoration, taken at any time.
According to one of the internal rules of the company, the new services are not announced only when they can be used. What is certain is that in the coming months and years, they will move the world on new issues. While some think that the medical system can build up and archive previous books and magazines from Google's Health project takes on such important dimensions that the company will soon find itself facing a Court Supr-
The fact that Google sets up a genetic database can give a good raw material to the next generation of science fiction authors. The novel by the famous Cory Doctorow, written with Orwellian halftones, describes the future in which a man could be approached in a frightening way just through Google data.
Two miners helped to remove traces of <0xC3><0x93>zd’s double homicide
"The police summoned two minors to question them in the case of the double homicide of <0xC3><0x93>zd. According to well-founded suspicions, they helped to make the traces of the crime disappear," - said the spokesman of the Borsod department police station.
The young people have acknowledged the charges against them, and for now they are accused of complicity.
The two minors, who according to the information of MTI (Hungarian Telegraph Agency) are young girls, defend themselves freely.
Conspiracy to commit murder can lead to up to five years in prison.
The suspect in the double homicide of <0xC3><0x93>zd, a 23-year-old local man, was placed in pre-trial detention on Sunday.
The charges against him are multiple homicide, committed premeditatedly and out of interest.
During the investigation, it was revealed that the 23-year-old owed a large sum of money to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to settle his debt and that is why he lured his creditor, last Wednesday, to a site in <0xC3><0x93>zd where he killed him, as well as the little girl of this man, aged 9 years.
According to information from the MTI, the young man premeditated his crime. The weapon with which he was going to commit his crimes hidden at the scene of the crime is proof.
The police examine the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the help of specialists.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange makes a proposal for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has proposed two hundred million euros, about five billion Czech crowns, for the purchase of 100% of the share package of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, the president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed this proposal that the Poles made despite the Czechs previously excluding the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for this exclusion is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state which wishes to part with more than 60% of its shares in a few months of activities.
According to the Czech business daily E15, the Polish proposal represents the highest bid to date for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Transatlantic Stock Exchange Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche B<0xC3><0xB6>rse have made an offer to date.
Petr Koblic, the director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among those interested, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner, and did not rule out the fact that this could lead to the disappearance of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated between 5 and 10 billion Czech crowns by market specialists.
On the basis of an agreement between the shareholders, some 90% of the papers would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is investment bank Patria Finance, with about 25 percent holdings, followed by bank Ceská Sporitelna’s 14.7 percent and Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l.’s 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
In their Tuesday comments on the international financial crisis, which are getting worse by the day, the leading newspapers of the European press are already referring to a “second 9/11”.
"The global financial catastrophe, we owe it to the American president" - accuses the daily of Rome, La Repubblica. "The president has not even been able to block with his own party behind a bill, improvised in haste, aimed at helping a desperate situation..."
Instead of a new Pearl Harbor, as billionaire Warren Buffett once said, it is more appropriate to speak of a second 9/11.
Part of the Madrid press also sees the scapegoat in Washington.
According to the vision of the daily El Mundo, it was the failures of the political leadership there that brought the world economy to the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the U.S. financial system is increasing every day, and subsequently, the entire world will pay the heavy price.
Bush’s plan was far from perfect, however according to the Congressional vote, a real danger threatens, one that Washington does not offer a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the balance, just at the moment when in the history of capitalism, one of the greatest transformations is taking place.
The threat cannot be ignored any longer - stresses the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva.
Some states can still hold out a lifeline to their hesitant financial institutions, and thanks to their taxpayers’ money, they can save them from bankruptcy.
Of course, if even more banks collapse like dominoes, then neither financial means nor new improvisations will be enough.
In the long run, we need the states of the European Union to ignore their national selfishness, and to centralize control over divided financial markets.
On Monday alone, the weakened financial institutions received more than 100 billion euros - recalled the Viennese daily, Der Standard, which adds that the fears that the European taxpayers will also have to put their hands in the pocket, very deep, in a similar way to the Americans in order to remedy the crisis, become more and more realistic.
So far, the EU has not really dealt with the crisis, which, like a tsunami, is sweeping across the old continent.
The "rescuers" must not immediately wield a hundred billion euros, but it would be wise if they noted in which case it would be rational to touch the taxpayers' money, with the aim of preventing greater damage.
Intelligent car mimics drone flight
What better way to develop obstacle-avoiding technologies than by imitating an obstacle detector that already exists in nature?
Like, for example, bees.
In the stunning project presented at CEATEC, taking place in Japan, the buzzing bees gave Nissan engineers the strategic starting idea, to inspire them on how they should design the next generation of obstacle detectors.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built a mini robot car, a bio-inspired BR23C-type self-robotized control system, which it has equipped with the qualities of bees, with the ultimate goal of encouraging the development of a system capable of avoiding all obstacles.
During its flights, each bee constitutes its own space, oval-shaped, which in reality, looks a lot like our secure protective shell - explained, during the exhibition, Kazuhhiro Doi, the director of the research and development and technological public relations department of the brand.
The faceted eye of the bee plays a primary role, since it is able to see in all directions, at an angle of 300 degrees.
To mimic the functions of the faceted eye, the engineers approached the idea of the laser rangefinder.
It identifies obstacles in a 180-degree angle and at a distance of 2 meters in front of the BR23C, it evaluates distances and sends a signal to the onboard microprocessor, which turns it into an avoidance maneuver right away.
The perception of the obstacle takes place in a fraction of a second. Then, the mini robot car, imitating the movements of the bee, immediately changes the direction of its wheels by turning it at an angle sufficient to avoid the collision.
Unlike any existing system, this avoidance maneuver takes place entirely instinctively.
“If this were not the case, the mini-auto robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid the obstacle,” said Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the Robotic Car Project.
It must react instinctively and instantaneously, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and inner layer of the protective envelope, a layer where for the moment the collision is considered inevitable.
This whole process must reflect what the bee does to avoid the other bees.
The process must take place in the blink of an eye.
Unlike bees, the difference cannot go up, down or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional, and only in the direction in which the wheels can turn.
In this way, instead of the infinite combinations that bees have to avoid other bees, in our case, we could only use the rotary movement, acceleration and slowdown as maneuvers available to the mini robot car.
The BR23C uses Lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and have a higher energy concentration, which makes their lifespan longer than in the Lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, it is instinctive intelligent reaction that is paramount, not data processing, let alone the ability to store.
This mechanism must process only a few incoming signals per second, and react to them.
It is not necessary to store them and react with the intuitive logic based on the data of the previous maneuvers. In this way, it uses only a few dozen kilobytes of continuous memory.
We don't need memory with a capacity of gigabytes, or even megabytes.
This is the first step towards designing a technology for instant avoidance, which Nissan estimates will make its way into mass-produced cars within the next ten years.
Another application could be its incorporation into the GPS satellite navigation system, so that it can guide the driver to his destination avoiding obstacles in his way.
We even gave the overpriced baby a name
The written version of the $700 billion economic rescue plan, aimed at buying back the banks’ bad loans, and using them repeatedly, is ready.
In the first round, half of this amount will be spent.
Reuters reports that in fresh debates extending into the night after midnight on Saturday, Congressional leaders agreed on days-long controversies surrounding the $700 billion bailout.
"We have taken a serious step forward," said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the US House of Representatives, according to which it remains only to put the agreements on paper.
The compromise, born from the plan, is supported by the two presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said in commenting on the results of the compromise that the program will work and be effective, however, other measures have yet to be implemented. According to Pelosi, there is no question, here, of the rescue of Wall Street, but to turn the wheels of the economy in the other direction.
The written version of the plan was made public before the Asian markets opened on Sunday evening at 8 p.m. local Washington time (i.e. Monday at 2 a.m., according to local Central European time), but did not cause a dramatic rise in stock markets.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will be the first to vote on the bill known as the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. Then, its fate will be in the hands of the Senate.
On Saturday night, President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi, and then the White House also welcomed the news of the deal.
"We are pleased with the progress made tonight, and we greatly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said in a statement.
Moreover, the program diverges from the Bush administration's original proposal that the $700 billion should be spent all at once to buy back bad debt securities.
From now on, a maximum of half of the $700 billion can be spent. The first $250 billion will be issued immediately after the passage of the law by Congress, probably on Monday. This first amount will be used by the Secretary of the Treasury to buy doubtful loans from the banks, while the use of the additional $100 billion will be left to the discretion of the President.
The program will be overseen by an independent body, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The spending of the second half of the $700 billion depends on a new congressional decree.
According to the law, the Treasury Secretariat will be able to implement a combined strategy: it will be able, at the same time, to buy bad debts, bad mortgage and bad mortgage securities, as well as other types of "toxic" debts.
The competent persons of the department stated that redemptions can take place in the context of an auction, but also directly.
The rule gives the companies concerned the opportunity to take part in an insurance program, where the Treasury Secretariat guarantees the tools at the origin of the concerns, for which the companies will have paid a premium equivalent to the foreseeable damages.
Paulson said the legislation provides the necessary tools to spend $700 billion on the urgent needs of the financial system, whether it’s the vast repurchase of bad debts, their insurance, or avoiding the risk of the system causing the collapse of some other major financial institution.
"We will take the necessary steps to be ready for the application of the law as soon as it is signed," he added.
On the other hand, bank managers who are in a bad position and waiting for state assistance can expect that their severance payments, simply called the golden parachute across the Atlantic, will be capped by the government.
The salary cap is mentioned only in specific cases, and the limitations depend on how the Treasury Secretariat offers its assistance to the enterprise.
The capping principle means that if the Treasury buys back as part of an auction, they will levy an excess tax on the golden parachute, unless the discredited bank president retires.
Directly after the redemption of the bad debts, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the amount paid to the leaders is not exaggerated.
For the image to be complete, it is still necessary to add that the existing golden parachutes are not modified. The ceiling concerns only the new contracts, this to motivate participation in the plan.
It is the first time in the history of the United States that legal caps will be in place on the appointments of directors general - commented the chairman of the committee in charge of financial benefits of the House of Representatives, Democrat Barney Frank.
In addition, the State acquires a right to acquire shares in the banks participating in the plan, thus reducing taxpayers' risk, since they can even win the case as soon as the economy and with it the rescued banks fall back on their feet.
The bill states that in the next five years, the President must introduce a proposal to Congress that will decide how the losses will be returned to taxpayers, from the financial sector.
On both sides, there were obviously those who expressed their doubts about this plan.
That’s not why American citizens have mandated us, it doesn’t protect taxpayer dollars,” said California Republican Rep. Darrell Issa.
His Democratic colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, believes that it is the same ones who are pressing for action, as those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continued to rise
In August 2008, domestic industrial sales prices increased by 0.1 percent compared to the previous month, and by 12.9 percent compared to August 2007 - reports the Central Statistical Office of Hungary.
Industrial export sales prices increased by 1.1 per cent compared to July 2008, while compared to a year earlier they decreased by 3.9 per cent.
As a result of fluctuations in domestic and export prices, industrial producer prices increased by 0.7 per cent compared to the previous month and by 3.2 per cent compared to the previous year.
Domestic industrial sales prices increased only to a lesser extent: by 0.1 per cent, compared to the previous month.
Domestic sales prices in the processing industry sectors were up only a tiny 0.1 per cent compared to July.
In August 2008, the most significant price increase was observed in the leather goods and footwear manufacturing sector (2.8 percent), with firstly, the manufacture of bags and belts with a monthly increase of 4.6 percent, then, the production of shoes with 2.5 percent monthly increase.
The higher price level of plastics and chemical raw materials has resulted in a significant monthly increase in the prices of the chemical products and materials manufacturing sector (1.6 per cent).
This resulted in deflation in the oil processing (1.4 per cent), electrical machinery and equipment manufacturing (0.9 per cent) and a minimal increase in the wood processing sector (0.1 per cent).
The prices of paper production, publishing and printing activities have not changed.
Other sectors of the processing industry recorded an increase of between 0.2 per cent and 0.9 per cent.
In the sectors of the supply of electricity, gas, steam and water, representing a significant weight in the national industrial operation, prices rose by 0.3 percent in August, mainly due to the effect of the increase in the price of gas set up by the authorities since July 1.
In a twelve-month comparison, taking into account domestic sales of processing sectors, oil processing sector prices experienced the most significant increase (32.4 percent).
In the metallurgical manufacturing sector, prices increased by 13.2 per cent, while in the important area of food, beverage and tobacco production, prices increased by 11 per cent.
Price decreases occurred in the textile and textile product production sectors (2.5 per cent), as well as in the manufacture of electrical machinery and appliances (0.3 per cent).
In other sectors of the processing industry, price increases ranged from 0.6 percent to 9.1 percent.
Across the processing industry as a whole, prices have increased by 10.2 per cent over the past year.
Prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors were 18.7 per cent higher than in the previous year.
Among domestic trade groups and by sector allocation, in August, profit-on-investment-initiating sectors showed the most significant monthly price increase (0.7 percent).
In the consumer goods sectors, prices increased by 0.3 per cent, while prices in the energy and materials sectors for further processing remained unchanged from the previous month.
In August 2008, compared to the same month of the previous year, the largest increase was observed in the sectors of energy production and materials for further processing (16.8 per cent).
In the consumer goods production sectors, inflation was measured at 6.8 per cent, while in the profit-making sectors, a decrease of 1.4 per cent was recorded.
Export sales prices of the industrial sector, in HUF, increased by 1.1 percent in August compared to the previous month, while they fell by 3.9 percent over 12 months.
In one month, our national means of payment weakened by 1.7 per cent against the euro, and by 7.1 per cent against the dollar. Compared to August 2007, it strengthened by 7.5 per cent against the euro and by 15.9 per cent against the dollar.
Next year, will we still need a visa to go to the United States?
Kinga G<0xC3><0xB6>ncz believes that there is a good chance that around January 12 the US-Hungarian visa waiver agreement will enter into force. This is what the Minister of Foreign Affairs said in Chicago, in front of the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
"Now, everything depends only on when the electronic entry and control systems across the Atlantic will be put into operation."
All the time, she drew attention to the fact that in the new system there will be no entry visa, but tourists will have to check in before departure.
The head of the Hungarian diplomacy will be in negotiations from today, in Washington.
He will meet with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Condoleezza Rice, to whom he will award the Commander's Cross with the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary, and will have a meeting with the foreign policy advisers of the presidential candidates, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain both back bank bailouts
On Sunday, Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of the two major US parties, pledged their support for the government’s $700 billion bailout, but there are politicians demanding the resignation of the US Treasury Secretary.
After days-long marathon negotiations, representatives in Congress and the administration finally announced early Sunday that they had reached agreements in principle on the bank rescue plan.
This financing plan, aimed at thawing the Wall Street crisis and the paralyzed credit market, has become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain even present themselves, each as more apt than the other, to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, with the spotlight on economic issues, Obama has again managed to get a bit of a head start. McCain's lead, obtained with the appointment of Sarah Palin as a running mate just after the Republican convention, has melted away.
At a campaign rally in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed hope that Congress would quickly pass the law on the $700 billion bailout.
He stressed that the proposal contains the consumer protection passages that he also supports.
"Now is the time to act responsibly... a danger threatens your work, your economies, the entire industrial sectors and the stability of the entire economy," he told a crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not fail to describe McCain’s economic ideas as outdated.
In an interview with ABC, McCain said, “We’re all going to have a hard time swallowing it ... but doing nothing is not a possible path.”
The Republican senator said that in the proposal are mentioned the creation of a Treasury control commission and the capping of the severance pay of senior leaders, and that he was, personally, very attached to these points.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no substantive role in the negotiations, while he, was in daily contact with the Treasury Secretary.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Sunday that there are serious hopes that the chamber will vote on the bill as early as Monday.
The press review of the German language territory
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only at the heart of the party that voters have become more aware - this is how Der Spiegel, the CSU's low score in the Bavarian country, evokes.
Haider was ready to govern Austria, to prevent the coalition of the Reds and Blacks.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the internet edition of the German left-wing news magazine, Franz Walter analyzes the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article entitled "The revolution in Bavaria devours its fathers".
According to this well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took office.
Christian socialists have transformed Bavaria for decades, and now these same modern citizens are turning their backs on them.
This change of era is at the same time the problem of all Christian democracy, and therefore also that of Angela Merker.
For the CSU, the failure was not entirely a surprise, but on Sunday, a process came to an end that was likely just ten years ago: the indisputable hegemony of the national party ended.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU rallied to 47.7 percent, for the first time since the 1950s, with a score below the 50 percent level.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is, at the time of the much-talked-about Stoiber.
The cause can be attributed to the modernization "devouring his parents", implemented in the region consistently by the CSU.
Sociologists have been announcing this for 40 years, but they have been very wrong about the pace. However, secularization, the results of education and the establishment of northern and eastern Germans in the developing region of Bavaria could not remain without consequences on the loyalty of CSU voters.
Modernisation goes hand in hand with increased opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible.
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only within the party that voters have become more aware, more critical and more stubborn.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks, it is precisely the groups of classical citizens who have rather distanced themselves from the CSU, such as the self-employed, the artisans, the holders of the baccalaureate and the graduates of higher education.
In these groups, support for UHC dropped below 40 percent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
In its article entitled "Who? With Who? The party chairmen stand on the sidelines in the face of coalition issues", the conservative Austrian daily deals with the situation of the confused domestic politics that has taken hold after the Austrian elections.
The Austrian Socialists of the SP<0xC3><0x96> wish to discuss with the conservatives of the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP prohibits the SP<0xC3><0x96> from interfering in its internal affairs.
The populist BZ<0xC3><0x96> party is open to negotiations and the Greens do not yet want to agree on a coalition.
The elections have taken place, now everything revolves around the coalition; during the debates organized on public television, party leaders have barely hinted at their cards.
Werner Faymann, the president of the SP<0xC3><0x96>, confirmed that he wanted to talk to the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to show that collaboration between the two parties is indeed possible - this is what already exists in some regions and in the socialist partnership.
The question of whether he would imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the <0xC3><0x96>VP, as vice-chancellor, remains open on Faymann's part.
As he mentioned, the Sch<0xC3><0xBC>ssel-Molterer guideline was, in any event, rejected.
A replica of this combination is out of the question.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the proposals of the Reds.
As he has already said, a collaboration will surely be unsuccessful if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
In his party, the choice of opposition or entry into the coalition is for the time being a very open question, and these points must absolutely be debated within the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
J<0xC3><0xB6>rg Haider, President of the BZ<0xC3><0x96>, is once again open to all proposals.
"To avoid the coalition of reds and blacks, we are ready to assume government responsibilities," Haider said.
Jár<0xC3><0xB3>ka said: We must break the vicious circle of poverty and segregation
Today, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, hosted by France, began in Paris as the representative of the current Presidency of the European Union.
In her message presented to the plenary, as one of the main spokespersons of the expert consultation, L<0xC3><0xAD>via Jár<0xC3><0xB3>ka, MEP Fidesz European People's Party, drew attention to the segregation in education, because it is a violation of the right that most affects Roma children and therefore, one of the main obstacles to their success in life.
On behalf of the French Presidency, this high-level conference was opened, on the one hand, by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, and, on the other, by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Labour, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among those invited to take part in the consultation are the European social partners, as well as the most prominent representatives of European legal protection and civil organisations, in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the group of the MP Fidesz Popular Party, Jár<0xC3><0xB3>ka warned that in addition to the distinctions observed when hiring, Roma disappear from the labor market, in the first place, as a result of their low qualification.
"An overwhelming majority of young Roma do not have high school diplomas, and as a result of poor quality elementary education, only a tiny fraction have the opportunity to obtain a post-secondary degree."
Furthermore, Jár<0xC3><0xB3>ka stressed that education as a basic human right plays a key role when other fundamental rights are to be asserted.
Investing in the early education of Roma children means a strengthening of the economy of the member countries of the European Union.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to raise awareness of these relationships in the widest possible circle, including between Roma and non-Roma.
Indeed, the earlier a Roma child starts school, the greater his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; by taxes paid from his income and consumption, he participates in the state budget.
"Because of their European Union nationality, Roma must be assured of their right to a quality education, and be protected from a low-quality and sectarian education." - stressed L<0xC3><0xAD>via Jár<0xC3><0xB3>ka.
According to the MEP, an objective-oriented and action-oriented collaboration of the European Union is necessary for an immediate acceleration of the process of desegregation of schools. For this, compliance with the existing anti-discrimination directives and in preparation is of paramount importance.
"It is necessary to break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, to give the opportunities provided by democracy to Roma children, so that they can participate as full citizens in the future of Europe" - demanded Jár<0xC3><0xB3>ka.
In the name of the European Year for Equal Opportunities for All, the aim of the Summit for Equal Opportunities in Europe, which has been held every year since the Berlin Summit last year, is to provide a single platform to support measures to promote equal opportunities and to combat discrimination, at European and Member State level.
UHC: Grace for a period of transition
It is in October that the decision will be taken on the fate of the fallen duo Huber-Beckstein
Despite this pitiful electoral failure, the heads have not yet fallen, and the debate on personal issues at the Bavarian CSU summits has been adjourned.
The party president, Erwin Hube, and the head of the regional government, G<0xC3><0xBC>nther Beckstein, can still keep their seats. The question is how long will the pardon last?
The fate of the tandem, having suffered a catastrophic 17 percent loss of voice, will be on the agenda of the exceptional party congress, held on the last weekend of October.
The members of this much-criticized pair have, in any case, made it feel that they did not particularly care about their seat.
Thanks to this, they worked to appease the furious members of the faction and the base, who a day after the "Bavarian tsunami" demanded personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - it is true, still under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, at the peak of his career - the socio-Christian union won 60.7 percent, while today, a year after the putsch against Stoiber, only 43.4 percent of their strength remains.
For 46 years, the CSU was the "only sovereign" of Bavaria giving 18 percent of German GDP.
But the Conservatives still rely heavily on this southern region, which is of key importance to the Hungarian economy, and in the future they will be forced into coalition.
As one of the first signs of an internal reorganization of the party, the vice-president and federal minister of agriculture, Horst Seehofer, presented as the possible successor of Huber, also received a place in this modest recognition group, which initiates groping discussions with the Liberals of the FDP, as well as with the possible Free Voters, formed along the right-wing values of the party.
A strange twist of fate has been that with the help of the list of Free Voters, Gabriele Pauli, whose decision against Stroiber has served as a possibility of putsch perpetrated by the Huber-Beckstein duo, comes into the legislation, and then treats the very ambitious municipal politician unceremoniously.
Now the leaders of the CSU are putting all their energy into stabilizing, in one way or another, Beckstein.
In this transition, Stoiber, who until now was pulling the strings behind the scenes, will also receive an active role. The former head of the regional government and former president of the CSU, designated September 28 as the most bitter day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made some bitter remarks to the CDU, which he said deserved much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning for the CDU and also for Angela Merkel.
Following the September 2009 Bundestag elections, Merkel will only be able to become chancellor again if they somehow re-establish a common force, the CSU, which played an important role in the 2005 national success.
According to Merkel, hardly hiding her disappointment caused by the fiasco, the loss of ground of the CSU will not negatively influence the grand coalition of Berlin.
This is however relative because it will not be easier to manage the wounded CSU, and the crisis of the social democrats still lasts.
Since 1946, the SPD has achieved its worst results with 18.6 percent in Bavaria.
Lukasenko's rivals: 110 - 0
No opposition MPs entered the Belarusian parliament after Sunday's elections.
According to Russian observers, this is explained by a country led by Alexander Lukashenko, which ensures prosperity and stability, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), it is explained by illegalities committed during the counting of votes.
The OSCE, having sent 450 observers from 43 countries, does not recognize the elections.
Although the legislative composed of 110 people in this country of 10 million inhabitants has been doing very well of opposition for long decades, before the elections of yesterday, the opposition uniting its forces under the name of United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) seriously hoped that Lukashenko, renewing his mandate of president for the fourth time in the "constitutional elections 2006, on the traces of the modification of the
In this way, the ODSZ gave up its originally planned boycott.
The fact that Belarus, economically dependent more and more on Russia, would like to improve its relations with the EU, where because of the Belarusian political order described as undemocratic, Lukashenko and several high-ranking politicians do not receive a natural gas visa, was one of the most important expectations of the opposition.
The fact that the OSCE, when assessing the campaign, focused on positive changes rather than failures, such as a ban on running for a third of the opposition candidates, referred to a prior appeasement.
However, Monday's OSCE communiqué already challenged the campaign, during which most of the opposition candidates could not appear in the media, and particularly the fact that the opposition could not be present when counting the votes.
Despite all this, the opposition still feels a palpable improvement in the political regime: the political prisoners have regained their freedom, and Minsk is ready for small confrontations with Moscow, always refusing to recognize South Ossetia and Abazzia separated from Georgia. Now, Russia with which Belarus forms a confederation on paper, considers the two independent territories already a month.
"We have taken two steps forward, and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue has started between Belarus and the EU," Alexander Milinkevitch told our newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate of the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable that this remains so, despite the fact that "the power has been afraid in this parliament which has no weight, to bring in even a single opponent".
The opposition is not planning any protests based on the results, but is trying to get its message out to voters about the need for economic reforms.
"Of course, we have a lot of worries on this side: we have to get our opposing newspapers printed in Russia, the local authorities are putting us in the wheels when it comes to broadcasting, but I can also see that they are increasingly supporting the elections, even in the circle of the elderly," said Milinkevitch, referring to the fact that in the current regime of Lukashenka is more supported.
"Due to the country's debt and rising trade deficit, the collapse of social security, 'evoking the silence of a cemetery', is now only a matter of time," Milinkevitch said.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers called the elections democratic.
Sergey Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words, but in deeds." In this way, the absence of opposition is only proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "Starting today, breakfast before work."
Never in the history of Palais Chigi had there been revolving doors for the entry and exit of employees.
But as of today, this new measure is in force against the little smart ones, against who points and then goes to drink coffee at the bar during working hours.
The anti-lazy novelty was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"The revolving doors - says Brunetta - are an instrument to work better, with more productivity, more presences and more services," says the minister.
Now begins a new season of accountability and transparency.
"It's reformism," Brunetta said.
The installation in all the institutions of the Presidency of the Council is completed with the Chigi Palace.
According to Masi, "the choice of revolving doors is important even from a symbolic point of view.
No resistance from the employees was recorded, the secretary general assures: "it is a process shared by the employees, and we have had the collaboration of all".
In short, no more breakfast during working hours; no more coffee or croissant.
Brunetta’s promise, which suggests with a smile, “a good cappuccino at 7 am is an excellent and healthy resolution”.
At a conference at the Ecole Supérieure de l'Administration publique
In three months, the absences of sick public employees have been reduced by 50%, or 60 thousand more workers in a year.
And he adds that it is essential to make the Public Administration more effective.
Italian, "whose wage dynamics - explains the minister - the last 8-10 years have doubled compared to the private sector, and well beyond inflation rates.
At the same time, thousands of public employees came together to challenge the standards of the Brunetta decree using Codacons.
"While the Minister of the Public Service today spreads the data regarding the decrease of absenteeism in the workplace due to illness - writes the association of consumers - the people of the "active idlers" continues to increase.
Indeed, in Italy, thousands of correct and productive civil servants gathered to declare war on the illegitimate norms contained in the decree.
In particular, in the Tar, the exclusion of additional allowances in case of infirmity due to service; the extension of the hours of the sick worker's home hours, during which the control visits are carried out, as well as other aspects contained in the new provisions desired by the Minister, are contested.
Accidents in the workplace, Napolitano: "Crucial prevention"
Every day in Italy, there are 2,500 accidents at work, 3 deaths and 27 people who remain permanently disabled.
In 2007, the Inail data confirmed that white deaths were around 1,200.
These figures testify to the seriousness of the phenomenon, which remains one of the main causes of death, and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
To draw the attention of institutions, social forces and the media to this dramatic aspect, Anmil is celebrating today, in all Italian provinces, the 58th National Day of Victims of Accidents at Work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
“The worrying data disseminated by Anmil, as well as the tragic events of recent days, confirm the importance of the subject of prevention in the workplace,” said the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, in a message sent to the President of Anmil, the National Association of the Mutilated and Invalids of Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his "sincere appreciation for the continuous associative effort in favor of prevention in the workplace, the protection of injured workers, assistance to the families of the victims and the awareness of public opinion"
Naturally indignant, everyone has struck a fist to put an end to such tragedies that, by their dimension, arouse the clamor of the media and the participation of public opinion, even if the daily reality presents us with dramatic cases, even repetitive in their dynamics.
Napolitano does not hide that "there is certainly a problem of resources: it is essential to invest in training and information"
The many initiatives promoted in the school sector are of particular importance for a more direct awareness on the part of young people entering the world of work.
It is our duty, to maintain the attention to this phenomenon, not to underrate the alarm on the social gravity, to apply and improve the legislative norms.
For his part, the President of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini stressed how "this phenomenon of the white dead constitutes an absolute social emergency, which insults the conscience of each of us, and imposes on all institutions, to make a concrete effort to put an end to it quickly".
The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not mean that the number of white deaths is still impressive, "said later the president of the Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
"We do not want this 'discount tendency' to be translated into a minor attention, because it is precisely when the attention relaxes that tragedy happens.
"We believe that in general, not enough is done to contrast the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be done through multiple actions."
"In our opinion - Mercandelli has emphasized - more controls and inspections are necessary, as well as a more important intervention on the formation of the workers, and this, from the school".
- He added- "another effort must be made to communicate and raise public awareness.
"But above all, we need a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers in the face of a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli then denounced "the progressive deterioration of the conditions for safeguarding the compensation provided for victims of work" and the "drift of assistance towards which the system is oriented in recent years".
"The objective, therefore, is to give back to the worker the guarantee of insurance - he added - so that the fate of the one who has an accident, must not depend on spontaneity or the enlargement of the legislator"
Mp3 players pointed fingers, they put hearing at risk.
Listening to music at full volume for an extended period using portable music devices such as MP3 players can cause permanent hearing damage.
This is announced by the European Commission, which, in a statement issued in Brussels, cites the opinion of the Scientific Committee on the unexpected and recently identified health risks (Csrseri) of the EU, published today.
According to the report, “5 to 10 percent of those who listen to music at full volume for at least five years using portable music devices for more than an hour a day per week are at risk of permanent hearing loss.”
“I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and mobile phones at full volume, can unconsciously damage their hearing irreparably,” Kuneva said.
“According to scientific data, this is a clear risk and we need to react quickly.
What matters most is to raise consumer awareness and make this information public.
We also need to re-examine existing control systems in the light of scientific opinion, so that they are fully effective and can keep up with new technologies."
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the intensive use of portable musical devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise generated by them.
The scientists confirm that there are good reasons for concern, and that the European Commission will now examine with Member States and other interested parties, what measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable music devices and similar devices.
There is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable music devices to 100Db, but there is growing concern about hearing damage that could result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to limit this data using solutions such as reducing the levels and duration of exposure to noise.
The EU Scientific Committee notes that users of portable music devices, who listen to music at full volume (more than 89 decibels) for 5 hours a week, exceed the current limits on the maximum noise level allowed in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for prolonged periods, risk permanent loss of hearing ability after 5 years.
This is of interest to 5-10% of users of these devices, and their number can be quantified at around 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
In Rome, Alemanno ordered the departure of the Commission for the future of the capital.
Today we begin, in March we end, in June we will draw the sums.
This is the schedule set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capital", which took place this morning at the new headquarters, behind the Baths of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will develop the guidelines for Rome.
In March, when they are finished, the Committee and the Municipal Council will evaluate the analyses and projects, so as to present in June the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and its mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The commission is absolutely independent; all political, social and cultural ideas are represented in it - Alemanno wishes to emphasize - it will have to propose ideas for the development of Rome that can be used by the political decision-makers, who remain the Committee and the Municipal Council.
No overlapping of roles, but only the desire to have a corner where to elaborate a great project for Rome.
In March, she will have finished her tasks and will then disappear, because this experience must have a precise temporal duration.
In June-announce the mayor- we will present the strategic plan resulting from the work carried out by the Commission for the future of Rome Capital. "
For those who accuse the Commission of being useless, given that its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replies: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do, as well as on the quality of its proposals.
If quality is there, as in France thanks to the Attali Commission, as indeed in Rome, I am sure, its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics is overwhelmed by the management of daily life and emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to see ahead, and further, towards a deeper foresight, seriously working on the development of Rome and its future.
Moreover, the Mayor of Rome wishes to emphasize that "this Commission is not an unnecessary body or a bureaucratic whole: it is absolutely free, and will not cost a euro to Roman city dwellers, and will serve to study and involve the best intelligences who express the Capital.
For Alemanno, in fact, "it is necessary a draft of strategic reference, neither firm nor immobile, in order to allow our city, to improve, what it absolutely needs, while thinking about its future now a unitary spirit, ".
A future that, says the mayor of Rome, "will not be limited to the usual communal borders, but will look further" not only from the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as Capital, but also "in relation to the role that Rome can and must have, as the Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? The first anti-American president. That's why.
A famous American politician who likes to pass for independent, wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, because of his decisions, destroyed the U.S. economy and had relations (as he still has today, as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam.
The attacks on Obama are increasing as the election date approaches.
A Miami woman wrote on a website: “This person is full of ambition.”
Obama is really smart: he believes he will win the highest office of a nation that counts in all, two governors and five black senators!
In reality, these are attacks that do not say much; they are obviously attacks of a racial nature, and do not answer the question of all voters: will he be a good president? We also have the polls, which all declare that Obama will win and with a good advantage.
In this case, it is still someone who speaks with the heart and not with the brain.
A newspaper in Mississippi, in the bowels of the southern United States, wrote an article: once in the voting booth, we know well to whom the American patriot will give his vote.
Here emerges an aspect of the American mentality kept secret until the end.
“Say what you want, we’ll see if we put the cross on Obama or McCain.
There are even people who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave the United States.
Things never revealed until now, so much so that the success of the black candidate seems almost certain.
In any case, despite all these arguments, the winning card for the Democrats is George Bush.
1,500 people were asked: What were the mistakes made by Bush during his term? 89 percent answered: Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, that nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and was kicked in the buttocks.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives, and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Despite this, Iraq was, for the most part, Bush's weak spot.
Whoever takes George W's place will have a huge task to accomplish.
Usa, the economic debacle is felt even among journalists: in the press, it is time for suppressions. And many blame the Internet, this "murderer" of the newspaper.
Five hundred American journalists were questioned by the PEW Research Center about the status of their profession and mind control for the future.
Well, almost all journalists today are pessimistic about their future.
However, they did not openly declare to the information attachés, feeling less worried about the credibility.
They don’t feel as isolated as they once did.
The problem with American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of destroyed economic model.
In addition, the deletions made in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work on the assembly of newspapers, are a big problem.
This is a problem that must be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism as it is understood by the general public is not to be reduced in a consistent way.
An obvious but complex pessimism pervades American journalism.
Six out of ten senior executives and print newspaper journalists are convinced that journalism at the national level is going the wrong way.
Locally, the executive group is 65%.
Printed publication against broadcast.
Journalists have no trouble seeing where the web is going.
The biggest publishing houses are making their way to the Internet, perceived by many as the "murderer" of newsprint.
The “economic pressure” that journalists feel is increased by up to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted to turning to technology in hopes that it would “do something good” for their journalism.
Today, the biggest sticking point in American journalism is between those who run the newsrooms—that is, the editors—and the reporters who work for them.
56% of directors at the national level, are convinced that reporters share their values, while at the local level, this percentage drops to 23%.
For some, this is linked to “work safety”.
Managers who think they will lose their jobs within 3 years, are 47% at the national level.
As far as journalists are concerned, it’s up to 30%.
“Safe work” at the staff level in America is still on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation like the US, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, TV and Internet, employers often offer what they want, and it quickly becomes a matter of take it or leave it.
Directors almost always receive large salaries, while the editor can earn 10 thousand dollars a month, in addition to retirement and the payment of insurance.
As for holidays, the logic becomes complicated: x days after the first year, x days after the third, up to 15 days in all, passed a certain number of years.
But according to their revelations, American journalists are often “sick” during the year.
It's the climate's fault.
UNIPOL: TRIBUNAL ROME, DANILO COPPOLA REMAINS AT GROTTAFERRATA.
The president of the second criminal section of the Rome court, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to dismiss the case of the real estate agent, Danilo Coppola, who had asked to be able to leave his city, Grottaferrata, for a dwelling in Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy as part of the investigation into the Unipol-Bnl escalation.
During the trial against him, last week, he had obtained home release transformed into compulsory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate agent be allowed to travel from the provincial city to a home in the capital.
According to the court, such travel (which the PM did not grant) would allow him to influence his company and have access to the evidence that accuses him.
The elites are in danger.
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a few days ago, with the vote of the House of Representatives, contrary to the rescue plan of $ 700 billion approved by the White House: a significant number of Americans were, and still are, more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the American economy.
And it is yesterday's New York Times that confirms it by communicating that the current crisis divides the Republican Party, even more divided between its East Coast soul, moderate, favorable to federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, on the contrary, conservative, hostile to "those of Washington" and the world of finance, powerful especially in the states of the Center and South.
The soul, precisely, that has been felt in a despotic way with the vote that I spoke to you at the beginning.
However, what has just been mentioned is only one example of the changes, of the great changes that the current economic earthquake foreshadows or already leaves to run: not only in the United States, but throughout the West, and may be not only here.
In the United States as in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the phenomena that have been brewing for some time, to the point that, in the new climate, they solidify and reveal themselves.
The first of these phenomena is the reactualization, the extraordinary revival, of the dual category of sovereign-state, with respect to a kind of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking and financial institutions that obviously have close relations with foreign countries, but which, above all, are involved on a large scale, the balance sheets of individuals and families who live in a single country, in a single state.
This immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of individuals and families who are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears economically global but politically, it is almost only here national.
Political internationalisation seems really out of the question, or it does not have much to say: the obvious proof is provided by the European Union, which, as usual, between the various interests and the various national strategies, fails to decide on any common political line.
And so, it is from the government of each state that everyone expects interventions, rescue and recovery plans, new rules, and above all an affection of credits: when one goes through a difficult period, only the states possess the economic resources, the mass of financial resources capable of trying to put things back in place.
They also possess the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of inestimable value, elements that no market or international organization will ever be able to dispose of in a similar way.
This new emphasis of the nation-state crisis is, moreover, in perfect harmony with the ever-increasing importance that the more recent economic developments tend to attribute to a factor quite linked to this element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we had now entered the realm of the network, of ever more sophisticated technology, of the non-material, convinced that globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we realized at a stroke of one hand, that our future will have to settle its accounts more and more with the rather unmaterial things such as the Internet.
Things that can certainly be transported from one place to another of the earth, but which are absolutely linked to a circumscribed space, to a territory.
Thus, who is sovereign, certainly has more cards than he who is not, that is, he who has the misfortune to live in a place without harvest, without oil and without water.
I now come to the second novelty which, however, provides for a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably said Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this respect, the economic crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective need for authoritarian leadership, the search for a person who knows how to take charge of the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for the existing leaderships, economic species that have proved inadequate and full of shadow zone.
And in addition, something even deeper, in a certain sense, even disturbing: a discredit, a suffering, an image of inadequacy, a feeling of remoteness that tends to involve the entire class of directors in a growing number of countries of the West.
Thus the conviction of the various classes increases even more, before the actions are the same ideas of the social elites until now at their peak, their way of listening and being, their culture in the complex acceptance of the term, to have the same time, and to be ever more alien to the opinions of the majorities.
In short, the demand for leadership, feeds in an underground way, a powerful and branched movement of delegitimization of the ruling classes and traditional political orders, which manifest themselves in the improvised electoral "revolts" or else, in the changes of collective moods of recent times Bush is against it might well be right, from the conservative rise in Austria to Bavaria, to the fall of the Labour Party in Italy.
One has the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format, would say someone, have always more and more difficulty, which does not date from today, to understand and therefore to represent the deep layers of Western societies, and that the economic crisis reinforces, increases and potentially acts in an disproportionate way.
In view of all this, to speak of a current "rebellion of the masses" on the agenda, seems frankly exaggerated.
But it is well said, keep your eyes wide open, it is not without reason.
The superglue to walk on the walls.
Defeat the laws of gravity with a super glue and, in the future, walk on the walls like Spiderman.
That is the goal of various American research centers, and today, a team of four institutes has almost succeeded.
With an adhesive measuring just 2.5 square centimetres, the researchers managed to hold a 100-kilogram body glued to a vertical wall.
The American journal Science published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material, invented by the team of researchers, is an evolution of those we know that use a particular structure of carbon, called carbon nanotubes.
"The glue principle can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged like a stack of spaghetti," explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists were inspired by the legs of the geckos, covered with microscopic hairs that ensure the animal a perfect grip.
Tests carried out on various materials, such as glass, Teflon, and sandpaper, showed that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles, and at the same time, that it "detaches easily from the wall," explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
MARKING WALLS? – “This material could be used as a temporary adhesive,” adds Liming Dai.
Maybe to walk on walls like Spiderman? Maybe so, but the researchers think of a much less fascinating use such as the connection between electronic devices, since carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electric current.
Other applications could relate to aerospace engineering.
At the moment, there are no superheroes.
The University of California, Berkeley, is also committed to the search for a new adhesive.
In an article in the American Chemical Society, the Californian researchers presented an adhesive formed of microfibers like hair, which cleans itself from dust during movement on a surface to ensure a perfect and constant adhesion.
Medications: never with fruit juices.
Pay attention to the juice of grapefruit, orange and apple.
These drinks, consumed especially in the summer because they are refreshing and rich in vitamins, when combined with certain vital medicines, alter their absorption, amplifying or decreasing depending on the case, their effectiveness, with even serious consequences for health.
David Nailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, recalls the risks of fruit juices whether they are, in box or fresh, if associated with the ingestion of certain drugs; during the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society underway in Philadelphia, he launches a new alarm to reduce certain health effects: it is enough a glass of grapefruit juice, oranges and ricotta.
Grapefruit juice has already been heavily criticized for being held responsible for increasing the effects of certain anti-arrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, anti-stem and neurological drugs, up to toxic levels.
It was the Italian Medicines Agency itself, which had given the news in a newsletter dated two years, warning doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger derived from this mix and to pay attention to what one drinks, if one takes drugs such as, for example, Diazepam or Methadone.
NOT ONLY PAMPLEMOUSE- According to experts, even orange and apple juice contains substances that inhibit drugs.
Long is the list of active ingredients inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
Michele Carruba, director of the department of pharmacology at the Public University of Milan, said: “These findings are generally immediately reported to the various national and international drug agencies who will have to change the information notes of the drugs if necessary.
It is always advisable to read the illustrative papers of the medicines that one takes, and, if something is not clear, not to be impressed, but to address clearly to the doctor or pharmacist "said the expert to the agency Ansa.
The Nobel Prize in Economics goes to Paul Krugman.
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to Paul Krugman for his research on business models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a neo-Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is also a well-known New York Times columnist.
Krugman is one of the greatest critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy solutions.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, during the days of the Enron bankruptcy, Krugman had written in an article published in the New York Times that the second event would have been more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States.
A forecast that sparked many controversies, and which was blamed on the economist for years, but which has now turned out to be accurate.
“I am surprised and even a little shocked at how quickly the memory of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom has disappeared from public attention,” Krugman said in late 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the European Central Bank's executive committee, Krugman is a "high-value economist", but also a very aggressive "disseminator", particularly critical of the excesses of liberalism of the Bush administration.
Open Office, this is the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
OpenOffice.org.3.0, the open source suite of personal productivity that aims to reach more and more users, from the home to the office, from professionals to the public administration, offering a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office.
After almost a year of work, carried out by volunteer developers, monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office package is shown to the general public with various new features: from the welcome screen, and the revised and less austere interface, to other more important ones, such as the compatibility born for the latest Apple Mac OS X operating system, and support for the new ISODF format (Open Document Format).
Open Office has paid particular attention to the interaction with the Office 2007 suite, and it is indeed possible to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx.)
Also interesting are some functions specific to certain modules, such as the one that allows you to reduce the dimensions of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example, to send them by email, or to import PDF files into the graphic development module, maintaining the original appearance of the page.
Also on this front, it is possible to create "hybrid PDF" documents that unite the typical graphic of the Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or a text editor.
The collaboration between several people is an element that has had various improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet, various users can intervene, avoiding conflicts on the changes, in the elaboration of texts, because each collaborator is assigned a color of comments for better recognition during the revision phase.
Some companies are even working to bring some OpenOffice features to the web (on the cloud), and in the coming weeks, they should issue the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and is in addition to the English version that was on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the suite is as usual available in addition, for the Linux operating system.
Upon request, the installation CD can be shipped to your home or workplace.
And if the theme of free can be a way to disseminate it in homes, it is precisely in business, that Open Office next tries the big challenge, already being able to count on various projects carried out in public administration and schools.
Not to mention the realities that offer a training, consultation and assistance service, ideal for small and medium-sized companies, which could also open up to business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the equivalent video writing of Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for rival presentations of PowerPoint; Dbase, such as the famous Access, is the program that allows to work on databases; finally Drwa is the graphic module.
Target for 2008, reach 5 million downloads, and considering that today there are almost 3 million and 600 miles, it is likely that with the release of the new version, we can even exceed the expected figure
Kohl also, is positive, this is the fourth case of doping.
New case of positivity at the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian of the Gerolsteiner team, Bernhard Kohl, qualified third, and winner of the jersey of the best climber.
It is the website of the daily newspaper L'Equipe that reports the news.
At 26 years old, Kohl is the fourth positive cyclist at Cera, the third generation Epo, after the Italians Riccardo Ricc<0xC3><0xB2> and Leonardo Piepoli, and the German Stefan Schumacher, also from Gerolsteiner.
The blood tests carried out on Kohl’s specimens are part of those carried out in recent weeks by the laboratories of Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-analyses confirm the positivity at Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place in the Tour and will have to expect two years of elimination.
The news of Kohl's positivity at the EPO of third generation, was confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who communicated to the Associated Press, having notified the positivity to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed on the podium behind Spaniard Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, thus winning the polka dot jersey of the best climber.
IMMIGRES:NEW YORK TIMES ASKS IF ITALY IS RACISM?
Italy "as a country of emigrants has recently become a privileged destination for immigrants" met with reluctance.
This is what the New York Times is interested in, which dedicated a long article discussing the theme of racism in Italy, starting with the case of the young Abdul William Guibre, a native of Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan, for stealing a box of biscuits.
This case highlights what the New York Times defines as the “northern paradox”: the northern regions are both those where “more integration and more work” is recorded, but also “the strongest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the most important support for the Lega Nord”
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the NYT also referred to episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only.
Even the new legislature wanted by the Lega to curb immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants, is cited as evidence of climate change in Italy.
"Giorgio Napolitano, during his meeting with Benedict XVI in the Quirinal, asked that the State and the Church work together to overcome racism."
Students victims of expensive rents, up to 900 euros for a room.
The student housing market is not in crisis
According to the latest survey of the Sunia, the tenants' union, renting a single room can cost a student, up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now reached very serious aspects to the point of excluding entire categories of young people from the right to study because of the very high overall costs that families from abroad must support - explains the head of the Sunia design office, Laura Mariani - in these cities, the high demand from students has so distorted the market that a process of generalized increase has begun even for residents.
In most cases, rental offers also involve a series of violations: free, unregistered, rent-free, sub-rental contracts.
For the Sunia, extraordinary interventions through the revision of tax, are necessary to calm prices.
Reading the survey in detail, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, it takes about 450 euros; for a single room, it goes from 650 euros minimum (Black Belt area), to an average value of 800 (Lambiate area, Udine, and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 euros (Vittoria area)
In Florence, a bed costs on average, 350/400 euros, a room about 700 euros.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in areas close to the University, it takes 250/280 euros for a bed in a double, and 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, in the areas close to the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), we ask about 600 euros for a single, 450 for a bed in a double.
Slightly lower values (€550 for a single) for the areas close to the other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecitt<0xC3><0xA0>).
One can only save if one moves away in the peripheral areas: 300 euro for a bed, and 450 for a single in the Predestina, Centocelle or similar area.
In Naples, for a bed it takes 300/400 euros, for a simple one, we spend from 400 to 600 euros, with higher prices in the Policlinico, Vomero, and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari, for bed, it takes 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have a major importance in the city economy.
Finally, cities such as Perugia, in which rentals are often taken by extra-community students, there is a further anomaly: the rent charged to foreign students is increased by 25/30% compared to that applied to Italians.
Farewell old cinema Paradiso, the cities eliminate the historic cinemas.
Historical movie theaters close in favor of Multiplex.
“A city without cinemas is a blind city, it’s like a face without eyes.”
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore, illustrates well what is happening in the major Italian urban centers, but also in the provincial cities,
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the birth on the periphery of large multi-screen cinemas, and the death of mono-screen consumption in the central areas of cities, is one of the major events that seems to us inescapable and incontestable; it also has all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
To disappear, they are often historical places and loaded with memory, "it's as if one of my friends disappeared, someone we know, with whom we shared a part of the way and so many emotions", observes the director of the Nuovo Cinema Paradiso, a film that offers to Tornatore 20 years ago, the first Oscar as well as the Grand Prix of the Jury of Cannes, and which always told the story of a
The figures provided by Anec, the main association of traders, mean everything: in the last five years, 316 traditional cinemas have closed, and it is the cinemas of the main cities that have mostly paid the cost: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closure, Roma Emilia leads with 82 cinemas lost, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
The proof that confirms that the first responsible for their disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, because it is the three Italian regions that have recorded the most new multi-screen cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany as in Emilia-Romagna.
"Italian exploitation has developed irrationally," observes Paolo Protti, president of the Anec, "it is useful to build new structures, but it would still be necessary to guarantee the survival of those that already exist, because when a room closes in a city, these frequenters are not necessarily all willing to go to multiplexes.
Not to mention the failed deliberation of the credit in favor of the merchants: the antecedent debt of the State is about 10 million euros.
It is shameful that, from an ethical and moral point of view, the Government does not respect existing laws.
To support the sector, it would need between 16 and 18 million euros per year.
Notably, Bologna, the first Italian city that, worried by these closures, decided to resolve the situation through the signing of a protocol between the City Hall and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy, to defend and promote single-screen cinemas in the historic centers and in the outskirts.
Among the planned regulations, there are measures of tax facilities in favor of managers and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the zone with limited traffic, and will have special rates for parking and in some car parks.
"It is an initiative that I like," Giuseppe Tornatore observes, "and I hope that other cities will follow Bologna's example by implementing other measures.
It is obvious, however, that to contrast the super power of multiplexes, traditional rooms must also improve the quality of sound and image, because today's audience is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that for me has always been important: the closure of the Supercinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make "New Paradiso cinema" which I had already been thinking about for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass by the Rialto, or the Quirinal of Via Nazionale, now closed, where I have lived so many shared emotions, I turn the other way so as not to see the panels blackened by the dust.
Links between politics and ‘ndrangheta, arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro.
“The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to standardize the choices of the City Hall to the interests of the Piromalli clan.”
the magistrates of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria, against the mayor and vice mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione, as well as Rosario Schiavione, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competition for mafia association.
The handcuffs also for Gioacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and the public administrations, and his grandson lawyer, homonymous of the boss, already condemned for association of criminals of mafia type, as well as to pay 10 million euros.
"an affront to legal and moral norms, and above all common sense," write the prosecutors, the two local administrations had expressed the will to pay consultations to Mr. Piromalli.
"Thus it would have been granted to the clan - write the judges - to officially enter inside the town halls facilitating the possibilities, already considerable, of control and orientation of the public administration"
The president of the Calabrian regional committee Agazio Loiero, does not hide that "collusions between local committees and organized crime, there are more than one" in his region: "there are places where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are also many politicians who resist the pressures of the ndrangheta, heroes who are honest.
The arrests this morning follow those of last July, after which the police announced that they had decapitated the Piromalli clan.
As early as the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved; already in 1991, and still because of alleged conditioning between organized crime and the local administration, the local politicians had been discharged from their function of administering the City.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the People's Party at the time of the dissolution, had been appointed leader of a centre-right coalition after the May 2006 runoff.
He shouted at the scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the communal council.
He accused the deputy interior minister at the time, Marco Minniti, accusing him of having engineered the whole thing for a political issue, but given the request for incarceration signed this morning, the judges explain that the Piromalli clan had even managed to request the variation of the A3 project.
Starting from the interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, the pms write, emerged "the willingness to marry the demands of a businessman, representative of a better-known group, close to the Piromalli, standardizing the choices of the public administration to the interests of the clan.
When energy is born from waves, now the big ones are launching.
This is an disproportionate deposit that occupies more than 70% of the surface of the planet and now the world's major energy companies are discovering it.
Waves, currents, tides, these are the new renewable sources on which giants like Chevron have set their eyes, and now are trying to get their hands on them.
The possibility of obtaining energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for hundreds of years, and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil fell, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put aside, but now the environmental authorities and the new increase in oil give a great boom to the sector
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15% of the world’s electricity need could be met by sea swell operating systems.
This amount would be double that produced by nuclear power plants.
And besides, there would be the currents and the tides..
Colossus to attack.
The first company to invest in marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build a facility in northern Portugal.
When the agreement was announced, it seemed like a real revolutionary step.
Two years after that, more and more candidates among these companies dedicated to traditional energy have always focused on marine energy.
"Chevron is currently studying ocean energy technologies," a spokesman for a company associated with the U.S. oil giant told the Wall Street Journal, "and is evaluating opportunities to cooperate with us."
The cooperation in question concerns the obtaining of a deliberate permit by the US Energy Commission, necessary to give rise to a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
This is a very interesting signal, especially considering that precisely in Alaska, the US continues to extract oil, and recently President Bush has set up a project for new excavations.
In addition to Chevron, there are Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey, which travel the path of energy coming from the sea, and the sums invested to date, although their details are not known, indicate according to observers, a growing interest.
Technology to be developed.
Experts speak of a technology still in its infancy, due to the fact that marine energy does not dispel fears about the environmental impact.
At present, systems such as those in Portugal, or some in Scotland, are small in size, and do not seem to create a big problem for the ecosystem.
To produce energy on a large scale, however, it is necessary to use technologies with a higher environmental impact.
And the choices are diverse: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of buoys connected to each other.
The wave thrust, which moves the sludge up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure of the pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
The pressure spins a turbine which, in turn, powers a generator.
The energy is sent to shore through underwater cables.
At the moment, we have four such systems in the project phase, awaiting a single federal approval and some of the energy could be used for a military installation.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces power for a mall and parking lot using six underwater turbines from New York’s East River.
The movement of the water during the tides, rotates the blades of the turbines, creating a rotary movement that feeds a generator.
Verdant announced that it has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to draw energy.
After the waves, the tides.
Of particular interest, they say at the Institute for Electrical Energy Research, right now deserves the potential of the tides.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable from wind, sun, or waves, and therefore more reliable as an energy source.
And it is precisely on tidal energy that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, with others, look to the coasts, have invested 7 and a half million dollars in 2008 and plans investments up to 35 million in 2009.
