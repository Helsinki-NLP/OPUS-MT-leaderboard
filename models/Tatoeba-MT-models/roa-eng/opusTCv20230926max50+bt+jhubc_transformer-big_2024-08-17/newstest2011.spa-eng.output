The <0xC4><0x8C>SSD in Prague knows neither Voldemort nor the pastry shop
The new <0xC4><0x8C>SSD councilors in the capital will, it seems, have to overcome the obvious language barriers for the members of the Prague Board and City Council to understand their renewed SDG partners.
The Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz period "examined" the members of the new <0xC4><0x8C>SSD Council to check their knowledge of the marked slang language that has emerged in recent years in the Council, when the current coalition members ruled Prague.
The coded dictionary that used the political cream of Prague during the previous period, by Mayor Pavel Bém, includes some of the most well-known characters, situations and causes of the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it has been found that the new councillors hardly understand these well-known concepts.
At least, that's what they say.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"The truth is, I don't know."
"Rather, I am a newcomer to Prague politics," Councillor for Culture Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Kauck<0xC3><0xBD> said during the "college" terminology exam.
And as far as the veteran politician is concerned, Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina reacted the same way.
You may be familiar with the concept of "golf hole."
“Maybe it’s the only expression of all the ones you asked me about that I use from time to time.”
"If not, I don't normally use slang."
From the glossary, the definitions of which were published by the newspaper Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz last June before the SDG voting congress, the editorial board chose six examples, in particular those that are especially related to the Prague municipal authorities.
The socialists had to explain the concepts "Voldemort", "Prague's biggest golf hole", "go to the pastry shop", "bull's neck", "betrayal of the capital" and "shield".
Three councilors agreed to take the test and a fourth, Anton<0xC3><0xAD>n Weinert, who will in future be responsible for education in Prague, initially agreed, but did not pick up the phone again.
The fifth councilman, Petr Dol<0xC3><0xAD>nek, directly refused to do so.
“I don’t get into these things and I don’t think I appreciate how civic democrats have fun.”
“What I do care about is how we will understand each other in the execution of our programs,” he said.
As we have seen, Councilman Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Kauck<0xC3><0xBD> allegedly did not realize that the previous title is an expression about an influential businessman and a friend of former Mayor Bém, Roman Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
The word "Voldemort" doesn't tell Kauck<0xC3><0xBD> anything; the only term he got right on the exam is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
“It’s about the Blanka tunnel,” says Kauck<0xC3><0xBD>, who adds immediately: “But rather I know from the news.”
“I’m going to have to sign up for a language course,” he jokes.
Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina is not the only one who recognises the Blanka Tunnel on the golf course, but also the Environment Councillor Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Plach<0xC3><0xBD>.
Afterwards, both socio-democrats know who Voldemort really is and Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Plach<0xC3><0xBD> even knows where to find that character; in addition, he suspects the meaning of "going to the bakery".
"I think it means going to a company in Prague"; soon it is revealed to Plach<0xC3><0xBD> that it is the headquarters of the companies in Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
Like B<0xC5><0x99>ezina, he indicates that such knowledge he gained from the news, but that he does not use such vocabulary.
According to the participants in the test, there is no such familiar glossary of colloquial terms among social democrats.
"I asked my teammates, but it really seems like we don't have anything like that."
"Rather, between us we use nicknames, sometimes abbreviations or play word games with names," says the president of the Prague <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, Petr Hul<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD>, whose fellow party members call Hulda.
"At school they called me B<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>za, but I don't know if my classmates also call me that," confesses his own nickname Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina.
The newspaper Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz tested the name and it works.
For his partymates, Weinert is D<0xC4><0x9B>da (similar to "yayo") or, less friendly, D<0xC4><0x9B>dek ("old"), the representative Miroslav Poche, with whom they associated before the election hoaxes during party sponsorship, receives the nickname "Igrá<0xC4><0x8D>ek" ("playmobil") from some of his comrades.
Nicknames are also the only expressions that social democrats tolerate in speech within the party.
Hul<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD> does not like to be called Hulda, but the newspaper Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz discovered even other nicknames for this Prague president.
"The doctor of batons' rights" apparently recalls that Petr Hul<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD> obtained his doctorate in law at the Bratislava police academy.
The government wants to limit the torture of "witches", as published in a brochure
Women considered witches in Burkina Faso share certain characteristics.
They are usually elderly, unable to work, for example for health reasons, are single and have no children.
Women who "turn" witches are sent to an isolated area, so that they do not harm the rest of the village.
"Men seldom suffer such a fate."
“Nor are healthy young women isolated, because they help with the work and have children,” explains a nun who, in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso, works in a special residence of more than a hundred women expelled from their communities.
The local government has decided to oppose this unusual "social measure".
It issued an information brochure that should help prevent witch-hunts.
However, this has a catch.
“More than 70% of adults in Burkina Faso cannot read,” warns the newspaper Die Standard about the disadvantages of written awareness.
Accusations of witchcraft are also common in other African countries.
In Gana, neighbouring Burkina Faso, 72-year-old Ammy Hemmah was killed last week when three women and two men tortured her, covered her with petrol and burned her.
The news appeared on the BBC.
The authors claim that it was due to an unfortunate set of circumstances.
According to her version, the woman caught fire in the oil that is used for ritual anointings.
It caught on fire when the group wanted to "expel the evil spirits" of the woman.
The isolation of "witches" is supported by people of all educational levels.
The newspaper Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso as saying: “The devourers of human souls have always posed a danger,” he said.
While in Burkina Faso the government is trying to appease the witch hunt, in Gambia last year the president still participated in it.
“Gambian President Jammeh, following the death of his aunt, launched a wide-ranging hunt for the witches who allegedly had been linked to his death and had attempted to kill the president himself by black magic.”
“To help him, he brought in shamans from nearby Guinea who, protected by police, military and the president’s personal escort, forcibly took men and women randomly selected from the Gambian peoples to the president’s property in Kanilai,” Amnesty International said in its report.
At the farm, the arrested people had to drink a potion of herbs with hallucinogenic effects that, in addition, caused them intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of those arrested did not survive the stay on the estate.
After international pressure, they finally released around a thousand people in detention.
Bakala’s Tenant: He warms up with coal stoves and signs a higher rent
The elderly and stubborn man walked through the doors of the customer service center of the RPG Byty company of the "coal magnate" Zde<0xC5><0x88>ek Bakala, the largest private owner of apartments for rent in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm he carried documents with the new three-storey rental contracts: his, his daughter’s and his son’s, who is serving his sentence.
All three have just been caught up in rent liberalization.
Instead of 3,500 Czech crowns a month, the son will pay from next year 4,100 crowns for a two-room apartment with separate second-class kitchen.
"In addition, there is no hot water and the heating is based on a solid fuel boiler," the man shows with his finger in the new contract of his son, on whose signature he has full powers.
"But I signed it," he explains, half angry, half resigned.
The civil association BytyOKD.cz, which described the new rental conditions as "incorrect and indecent", recommends that tenants do not sign the new contracts and wait until December 7, when it will publish a guide informing how to proceed in these cases.
But, in the face of this, man only makes a gesture.
“Everybody says one thing,” he says with a bad face.
Ostrava is becoming a large liberalisation testing laboratory.
After the New Year will occur with the vast majority of flats that, in the Czech Republic, were so far under a regulated rent.
That is why Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
The RPG mining waiting room is one of four in Ostrava and, by Tuesday at nine o’clock, was already full.
Right next to the doors are the security guards and next to them a number machine.
"Rent 2011", can be read on a bright button on your touch screen.
When you press it, a piece of paper with a number comes out of the machine.
Almost does not give time even to read "157" and already the number appears on the large screen located at the top of the room.
In a second, you're in line.
Soon after, an elderly couple arrives to ask, but the room crowd is not here for the new rentals.
Most people come to solve usual problems, as in the old days: requests for arrangements, insurance issues and similar matters.
The letters with the new rental contracts will arrive in Ostrava to the mailboxes of the tenants of most of the 44,000 floors belonging to RPG around mid-November.
RPG Byty proposes in the cards an increase in rent of between 15 and 38%.
On November 18, a special window opens in the customer service center for new rentals.
"It's been running for a week, so it's starting," respond, after briefly doubting the workers who are in it when the client introduces himself as a journalist.
Liberalization and the former Bakala miners’ flats are the most sensitive issues in the area.
Before the elections, the Vice-President of the Parliament, Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Zaorálek of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, treated them loudly and clearly and now they appear continuously in newspapers in the area.
"Twenty years later I want new soil."
“They didn’t even change my fucking bathroom plate,” the man mentioned in the introduction vents.
According to the workers, at the moment more than anything retirees come to check if they receive a discount on the rent if they sign on time, as promised by the special offer of RPG.
The remaining tenants who sign the new contract before December 15 will also receive half of the discount on the February rental.
However, the window of mining "liberalization" certainly does not manage to dispel the avalanche of doubts.
"Of the 360 customers who were here yesterday, they only asked about the rental in 2011 about forty or fifty people," estimates the employee of the window.
Meanwhile, RPG proposes on the web and on its boards to hold individual meetings on contracts when necessary.
If the two parties do not reach an agreement on the rental, an independent judge will have to settle the matter.
“This is not a threat, but information about the only way to proceed possible and completely in accordance with the law,” warns RPG on its pages.
"No one is going to be judged here," says one of the RPG Byty employees, and a man in the street in front of the customer service center gives at least part of the reason.
“I get a pension of 13,000 and I have 5,000 left for food; I have no means to go to court,” he says.
But, immediately, the employee sows doubt.
"We'll see."
“Mr. Zaorálek warns them in the media not to sign, so maybe people will wait,” he says.
Rent regulation will cease to exist in most of the Czech Republic in early 2011 and, according to RPG Byty, its increase is an economic necessity.
"Current rents still do not cover even the amounts necessary for the maintenance of the community fund," recalls Pavel Klime<0xC5><0xA1>, director of the residential portfolio of the company RPG Byty, adding that the careless state of the community fund that angers tenants is, for landlords, the main reason for increasing rent.
While during the five years that elapsed between 2005 and 2010 RPG could with the rents invest in apartments four billion, in the four years that will go from 2011 to 2014 the figure will increase to 5.2 billion.
The large screen that hangs from the ceiling, in front of the seats in the waiting room, now repeats some data that stand out in red.
"The increase in rental in 2011 by 15% and less applies to 31,200 apartments, i.e. more than 90% of RPG properties."
“In addition, it will always be a maximum of 7.50 CZK per square meter per month,” the screen reads.
Only 38% increase the rental of 400 floors of the RPG portfolio.
“In such cases, it is an increase from extremely low amounts of 19.66 kroner per square meter,” says RPG.
At 2,600 floors, the rent will remain unchanged next year.
RPG Byty promises that the liberalization will not suddenly affect rents, but will escalate between four to eight years.
In addition, he adds the following commitment: the company will invest all the money from the rent increase (see the graph) back on the floors, mainly in saving on heating: new windows and heating.
Priority will be given to those who sign the rental agreement.
Architects have understood that offices also need childcare
The Avriopoint administrative building in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
No one would say that it also hides in its interior a small nursery with everything proper to such facilities: colorful walls, creative furniture and even a miniature park on the outside terrace.
Since October of last year, the children of Arch.Design employees can come to it.
From the very first sketches of the Avriopoint building, the architectural project company Arch.Design, from whose studio many well-known buildings in Brno emerged, thought of including a space for its mini-kindergarten.
The company employs around 90 people, mainly in the age of the baby boom and wanted to allow the architects and draughtsmen to return to work soon after maternity.
Along with the possibility of enjoying a reduced schedule, the nursery is one of the benefits that Arch.Design offers to its workers as part of its social program.
Builders and architects thus have the opportunity to combine a demanding profession with childcare.
The mini-kindergarten was an idea of Arch.Designu’s own employees and, with the support of management, they managed to obtain funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company's childcare centre is financed through the European Social Fund under the Operational Programme for Human Resources and Employment and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the funding (more than CZK 2.8 million) they were able to purchase the equipment and, after two years, hire qualified staff and services.
When the funding runs out (two years), the company Arch.Design has the obligation to keep the mini-kindergarten in operation with its own funds for three years.
The preparation of the project lasted one year and in the submission of the application for funding contributed the company Economy Rating.
The care of the children is in the hands of qualified personnel. In addition, a nurse and a teacher from the Ministry of Education are present for their care all day. The nursery currently houses children with no age limit, although most of them are under three years of age.
Since it is a "mini-kindergarten", it can only accommodate a maximum of five children simultaneously, although with the shifts they go more during the day.
The operation of the nursery is flexible to suit the needs of parents and children of all workers have the same right to use the nursery, regardless of the hierarchy within the company.
Although this is individual teaching and care, the contents of the mini-kindergarten programme are comparable to the regular preschool programme.
In it, children not only play, but also receive quality teaching: from basic learning to school preparation, they teach up to English.
The class not only has toys and board games, but also a computer for children.
The presence of young children in the company itself create a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can go see their children at any time and avoid the stress of picking up children from school late when they are away from their workplace.
Thus, parents are more productive while working.
It is not surprising that this naturally generates a loyal relationship between the worker and his employer.
In this way, Arch.Design is among the companies that offer a great advantage for the admission of new workers: they support the family and, ultimately, this program reinforced staff marketing.
The House of Bones continues to fascinate after 100 years. See Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>’s interiors
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs resemble the column of a dinosaur and the balconies look like the mouth of an open fish.
This is the Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3>, in Barcelona, by the Catalan architect Antoni Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>.
Due to its skeleton-like shape, the locals nicknamed it "the house of bones".
Its organic forms, its striking colors, the novel use of stone, the fragments of tiles and mosaics, a facade reminiscent of scales and the omnipresent gently curved lines, all this is typical of the secession of Antoni Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>.
The cover of the house plays with dream lines, delicate colors and textures taken from nature and wildlife.
Paying more attention, one observes a certain geometry, rhythm and a carefully thought-out order.
At night, the entire facade of the house looks even more impressive, since it is illuminated in such a way that the brightness of the colors is improved.
Serpentea and the twisting of the forms continues to surprise us even inside.
The corrugated wood copies the window frames, railings, door trim, peepholes and signs.
The Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3>, located in the Eixample district at number 43 of the lively shopping street of Passeig de Gr<0xC3><0xA0>cia, emerged from the remodeling of a house of the year 1877 by the architect Emilio Sala Cortés.
The reconstruction lasted two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batll<0xC3><0xB3>, initially insisted on tearing down the previous building and starting from scratch, but soon accepted Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>’s idea of making a novel and cheaper reconstruction.
However, Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3>, made up of several apartments, was not designed by Antoni Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> alone.
The architect Josep Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Jujol collaborated in the design.
In fact, in his plans of the project emerged ornaments for the representative apartment of the owner of the property and the mosaics used in the facade.
On the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade also workers other creators and artists.
The collaboration in the proposals of Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3> was the beginning of Jujol’s successful collaboration with Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>.
Jujol participated in the construction of Casa Milá and Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>’s Park G<0xC3><0xBC>ell, where other pieces of it are located.
Due to its organic form, the locals soon after its completion dubbed it "the house of bones".
Others, due to the specific mechanism of opening the windows began to call it "the house of yawns".
It is also said that, at the top of the building, appears the sword of St. George, patron saint of Catalonia.
Other sculptural elements of the building hide religious motifs.
Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> designed in the house a unique system for the time of central heating with ventilation vents and typical fireplaces.
Its inclination of forty-five degrees may be strange.
During the construction, Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> did not respect at all the construction rules of the time and was not influenced by them.
Even so, the construction obtained the corresponding permission from the beginning, although evidently in it the data indicated on the planned reconstruction were so vague that, two years later, at its completion, the city council was so shocked with the result that it asked for it to be corrected.
It annoyed him, for example, that the construction included columns even up to the public sidewalk.
The arrangements were never made, quite the opposite: just fifteen days after the city council’s request, Josep Batll<0xC3><0xB3> requested (and obtained) permission to rent the two highest floors of the building.
On the lower floors the owner himself was installed.
In the gallery on the second floor was the living room and on the third floor the bedrooms and the private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The house, of six floors, is completely crossed by a staircase that leads to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the reform consisted in breaking all the angles and straight lines, covering them with curved walls.
Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> also worked with the modern concept of connecting space.
The common part can be completely connected by opening the doors of the living rooms and a larger group can communicate in this way without problems, without giving up the privacy necessary for more intimate conversations.
The house, with the reconstruction of Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>, not only got a new facade, but also an unusual roof and two additional floors.
It is also impressive how Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> plays with light, white and blue tiles covering the inner courtyard and skylights.
The play with the two colors brings maximum light on all floors of the house.
It was simply based on the principle that white reflects more light than dark colors, which instead absorb the sun’s rays.
Anyone can visit Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3>, which in 2005 was added to the UNESCO World Heritage list.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and most overloaded apartment of those accessible to the public.
The owners decided to open the doors to the public in 2002, on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
With the visits they confirmed, or discovered, that this is a very beneficial business and extended the visits to the common area and the attic, including the roof terrace.
The price of admission to the monument is not insignificant, it reaches 16.50 euros, although students, retirees and holders of tourist cards get a 20% discount.
The amount considerably exceeds the price of entry to other Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> buildings in the city.
If you want to enjoy the real atmosphere of the bed with its lizard towers, you should quickly befriend some resident of the neighboring houses and visit him at home.
How to choose the mattress and the box spring: women and men look for different things
Nothing like a pompous bed frame; what really confers its quality to a good bed is the surface to lie on, that is, the mattress and the box spring.
First of all, they must complement each other perfectly so that they adapt to the specific users.
During the election numerous elements come into play, including the weight, height, state of health and sex of the owner.
The type of interior in which the mattress and box spring are located is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in a weekend cabin that usually does not have heating, latex mattresses should not be used because they "heat up" more slowly.
In addition, they usually weigh considerably more than the usual polyurethane mattresses.
Therefore, it is necessary to turn them over more frequently.
If the canals in the center are not properly aerated and above are on a firm base, they keep moisture inside. Even mold can appear below.
When choosing a bed, customs also influence.
Those who have spent a lot of time abroad often use a very high mattress with a soft layer and will have trouble feeling good on a lower, hard surface.
“Almost every hockey player who came back from the NHL complained that they didn’t sleep as well here.”
"For their crushed shoulders, heels and hips they needed mattresses with a soft layer of viscoelastic."
“This type of mattresses are also recommended for people with diabetes who have long-term nervous system problems, so they receive poorly information from the joints and the skin,” explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in padded furniture.
Many hockey players, like other customers, have long preferred viscoelastic mattresses.
"Today there is no problem, because they have these suitable Tempur and the Italian Magniflex, but also the Czech brand Tropico."
You no longer have to be an NHL player to be able to appreciate viscoelastics.
This "miracle" works in a very simple way.
It optimizes your stiffness and shape depending on the heat absorbed or adapts to your body heat.
Nothing exerts pressure; during the night, he won’t lap like after a hard game.
He just sleeps better.
The viscoelastic also works as a protection against sores.
When choosing the size of the mattress, add to your height the length of your feet, that is, between 21 and 34 cm.
A man or woman with a height of about 180 cm will need a bed of between 210 and 220 cm.
The minimum width for one person should be, in a double room, 90 cm, in total 180 cm.
In the case of single rooms, for example singles, it is recommended at least between 120 and 140 cm.
So that a possible visit is also comfortable.
“If not, you can apply a simple rule to calculate the width: when lying on your back, you should have your hands comfortably shrunk towards your elbows,” advises the engineer Helena Prokopová, an expert at Cechu <0xC4><0x8D>aloun<0xC3><0xAD>k<0xC5><0xAF> a dekoratér<0xC5><0xAF>, who has already been dealing with the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture for many years.
In double rooms, each one needs its own box spring and mattress, so during the purchase you have to pay attention to combine the height of the mattresses.
Otherwise, it will be necessary to mount the bed bases at different heights, which is not always possible in all beds.
Foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, models with interior springs a minimum of 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters are for the layer that adapts to the shapes and softens.
"When you touch it with your hand or sit on the mattress, you should definitely not notice the springs," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a certain type of box spring.
Fully padded bedrooms, in which the mattress and base are like Siamese, make no sense in the bedroom.
Mattresses breathe poorly and you can not wash their cover, which today is often done.
And, since every night we sweat between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat, it is clear that after about five or seven years the mattress will begin to remind us of a large (and congested) sieve.
For this reason, specialists reject the slogans that speak of a mattress life of up to 25 years or even a lifetime guarantee.
However, everything has a but.
That's why sellers give a tip: on mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm, carefully take care of cleaning and washing the cover, but better add a mattress protector that can be removed and washed easily.
Although mattress covers with zipper closure are currently manufactured throughout its perimeter, so when you open them they stay in two parts (something very important for washing and the size of the washing machine!), its manipulation in the larger models (and by a single person) when lifting the mattress can seem like a fight between a flyweight and a heavy weight.
In bed, instead of a box spring, do you have a firm board?
Never! Never!
As much for the beds designed to spend a night visits.
However, you must make (if you do not already have) ventilation holes in the table and should be used with a mattress with springs inside and a minimum height of 15 cm with the springs in bags (such as the German Taschenfederkern) and a soft layer.
Polyurethane mattresses should not be used on such bases.
For non-articulable sheet bedsprings containing between 14 and 18 sheets, latex mattresses or sandwich mattresses (for example, a combination of latex and coconut fiber) may be used, although a bedspring with a larger number of sheets, 28 or more, in which the sheets of the lumbar área are reinforced and their rigidity can be regulated is always better.
Articulating sheet bed bases should not be used with a spring mattress, as it does not react to recline.
In addition to the adjustment of the stiffness of the sheets, shoulder protection can also be used.
It is a special fixation of the sheets that allows pressing or even tilting the sheets in such a way that they "surround" perfectly to the shoulders during sleep.
For men who have very broad shoulders, this is very important.
They are even remembered by the manufacturers of mattresses who, in the "males", began to use a softer area precisely around the shoulders.
They also remember women, for whom they put a softer area around the hips.
For the most demanding customers, there are bed bases with cross or slat structure with the so-called multi-twist damping.
The pressure is distributed between different points and the tension is lowered.
You should also keep in mind that even if you use the right mattress and box spring, if you use a bad pillow (large and "fluffy"), most of the advantages will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow must hold the head and the corners can only reach the shoulders, so that the muscles of the same can be relaxed.
The recommended size is 50 x 60 cm, something normal for example in Scandinavia.
When lying on your side, the pillow should be at the same level (when combined with the pillowcase with shoulder support or the softer area of the mattress) as the height of the shoulders.
Modern mattresses have something to do, it seems, with the original straw-filled mattresses.
Manufacturers continue to use, more and more often, natural materials or, at least, mixtures.
In fact, biological mattresses are in vogue.
Petroleum-based raw materials, with which polyurethane foam is made, are filled with natural oils, for example castor or soy.
In fact, virtually all known manufacturers employ soy.
"Biological, in the case of mattresses, means that the center is made only of materials of natural origin," explains Petr Va<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek of the company Tropico Plus.
Also, natural substances are used during the manufacture of the mattress cover, one of the first aloe vera.
But you can also opt for microcapsules, which release a fresh scent to forest or lavender.
There are also differences for men and women.
While men "refresh" with breeze vegetable extracts, so that the mattress cover absorbs heat and refreshes the body, women prefer to "warm up" the cover.
Red pepper extract improves blood circulation, so women feel more warmth.
The favorites right now?
Mattresses made of cold foam, which are more porous, with a structure of adapted cells, which makes them more permeable than those of normal polyurethane and offer more permeability.
The combination of various rigidities of cold foam and viscoelastic make it possible to manufacture mattresses of various zones that know perfectly where the head, shoulders and heels go.
A good quality mattress will cost you seven thousand crowns up.
Those who perform a therapeutic function usually have a lower VAT, since they are considered as sanitary means.
The first to gain this advantage in the Czech Republic was Gumotex.
It is difficult to save on mattresses and box springs.
Sometimes you can approve offers from manufacturers or sellers, who sometimes offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers Duofreeze mattresses with a Memory foam adhered to the cover for 11,990 crowns.
The second one is free.
The era of viscoelastic with an open cellular structure and high density began with the "cosmic" material of Tempur.
It initially emerged as material for NASA, because during takeoff astronauts were subjected to a huge overload.
Tempur softens with heat and hardens with cold.
Therefore, the human body, warm, exerts a perfect effect and optimally adapts its pressure.
Therefore, it is ideal to prevent sores from occurring, but also to improve comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foam is not only used in mattresses, but also for sanitary products, for example for pillows that are placed under the legs and relieve them, as well as their circulation.
Domestic manufacturers, for example, use Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam and the like.
More and more parents are using people-tracking devices to monitor their children
The fear for children leads more and more people to think about controlling them by GPS.
The system, initially designed for vehicle tracking, can also track the movement of people and thus contribute, for example, in the case of the disappearance of the nine-year-old girl Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka Janatková.
At the moment the device is about the size of a matchbox, but it will soon be reduced to the size of a watch.
Many people were afraid of the case of the missing Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka and began to be informed about the means available to better protect their children.
Even at the cost of invading their privacy.
“We are all trying to tell ourselves that this is not spying, but another way to reduce the chances of a tragedy,” says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the providers of tracking devices in the Czech market.
“I recognize that, in certain cases, such devices can be abused, for example if they are put in someone’s bag without their knowledge, but we have not yet come across such cases.”
“Most customers actually buy it for security reasons,” Pilin adds.
In his opinion, children should always know what the "box" is for and how it is used in an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bo<0xC4><0x8D>ková warns that if the child does not want to take it, he will simply throw it away.
“Even the youngest children show great creativity when it comes to intentionally losing certain things if they want to avoid being controlled.”
“Before, parents relied heavily on mobile phones, but these could be switched off as easily as the tracking device,” says Bo<0xC4><0x8D>ková.
In his opinion, it is debatable whether in case of attack such a device is really useful.
“If it’s a pre-arranged kidnapping, the perpetrator will almost always check to see if the child is carrying any kind of electronic device that can reveal their location.”
"Now it's the phone."
“As the use of tracking devices spreads, so will the search for them, since their sale will certainly be made with a lot of publicity.”
“In such cases, criminals are always one step ahead of the police,” says the psychologist.
However, he adds that such devices can help in the event of an impromptu attack by a pedophile.
According to Robert <0xC4><0x8C>ech of RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both vehicles and people, even if the tracking device is immediately destroyed after an attack, its presence can help.
“The device can be set to regularly send the position after a certain period of time.”
“If he suffers damage, he will at least facilitate the last position of the person in question.”
“The most expensive devices have a built-in tilt meter, so if the person simply slips and stands still, the device will immediately issue a warning with the position in question,” says <0xC4><0x8C>ech.
In his opinion, such a service can be obtained even with mobile smartphones with navigation, on which only special software should be installed.
The problem with current tracking units is that at the moment they are devices with a size similar to a matchbox or smaller mobile phones.
Therefore, they can get lost.
According to Pilin of Macro Weil, that’s why they’re currently testing devices that look like a digital clock.
“In addition, they will have the added advantage that a potential attacker may not identify the device.”
“Or identify it after a certain amount of time, which can buy the police time,” he adds.
Even if the tracking devices are worn on the wrist or hanging up, they will still use the same technology that is used for vehicle tracking.
This involves checking the position with a GPS system (which is used in regular navigation in the car) combined with the function of a mobile phone that communicates the current position.
The army has enough wicks to encircle the whole of the Czech Republic, but they only last two years.
The Czech army bought 445 kilometers of wick to set off explosives.
Already last year the Ministry of Defense added to its arsenal 224 kilometers of wick.
Therefore, they have stocks for 225 years.
The problem is that the lifespan of the wick is two years, four at most.
The army bought the fuse for explosives from the STV Group, a. s. for forty million crowns.
The General’s staff responded to MF DNES by justifying the purchase of such an enormous amount of wick by saying that soldiers need for training maneuvers 60 kilometers of wick a year.
According to the calculations of the pyrotechnicians of the army, with whom MF DNES was contacted, it is decided however that, in such a case, they should carry out such maneuvers with frequent use of explosives every year also all generals, high command officers, and even secretaries and cleaners.
They did not want to exempt either Defense Minister Alexandr Vondr and Army Captain Vlastimil Picek.
Only in this way could it be justified that the army should spend sixty kilometers of wick.
This is equivalent to 25,000 explosions.
Even if this were the case, the army would have sufficient stocks for more than ten years.
If, on the contrary, as experts say, for the initial training of each new professional comes with a maximum of two meters of wick, the army would have with the new purchase (even adding the consumption of the units of engineers or special) sufficient stocks for the 225 indicated above.
The soldiers of the Rapid Intervention Brigade complained to Minister Vondra in person recently because they say they have very little ammunition for various weapons, so even money-related shooting practices are limited.
And let's not talk about the lack of underwear.
"Nor can I understand that we repeatedly buy such quantities of wick."
“But it’s their decision, and they’ll certainly know why they’re acting like that.”
“For us, the army is a good customer that, as a company, we try to satisfy,” admits the commercial director of STV Group, Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>ck<0xC3><0xBD>.
Defense Ministry spokesman Jan Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek defends the hundreds of kilometers of wick, saying he will have stockpiles of this "ammunition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>ck<0xC3><0xBD> of the STV Group points out that the fuse only has a useful life of four years and, in the case of pyrotechnic products for the army or the police, two years.
“If it is stored in perfect conditions, it can last up to four,” says one of the soldiers who, due to possible criticism from the army, does not want to give his name.
After the end of its useful life, each munition must be carefully checked to see if it remains reliable and will not harm soldiers.
But these tests are not free and require an additional investment.
Another argument of the Ministry is that, by buying 445 kilometers of wick, it obtained a discount.
“They cost us 60 percent less than last year’s order of 244 kilometers,” said Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, a spokesman for the Defense Ministry’s procurement center.
Just to compare: the annual consumption of wicks by police pyrotechnics, which remove ammunition from World War II or that left by the Soviet army, has not exceeded 1,500 meters for years.
In addition, the police always ask only for the right amount to deplete the ammunition before the end of its useful life.
They decided for safety reasons for pyrotechnics and, in the meantime, more modern and reliable wick types can be achieved.
The Ministry already has clear difficulties in finishing tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Pact era, when the 200,000-strong Czechoslovak army was preparing for a campaign on the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnicians with whom MF DNES spoke, after a couple of years the following problem will occur with the current one: hundreds of kilometers of old wick will have to be removed, which is now being bought "cheap".
So far I'm still living from the contacts I got thanks to the contest
Winning the "Entrepreneur of the Year" competition helped Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun sell his hotel franchises.
The last edition, won the contest "Entrepreneur of the year" the 28-year-old entrepreneur Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun from Liberec.
Their success story seems to be taken from a movie.
Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun loved to travel.
Abroad he realized that in Liberec quality accommodation was needed at a good price.
With the savings he gathered from seasonal jobs abroad and a bank loan he bought a house that was half-ruined composed of five floors.
Considering he was still in his third year of college, he was really brave.
“Today, the value for money of accommodation in our area pushed me to do something about it,” says Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun.
He began to rent the rebuilt first floor to foreign workers.
All the income he earned he invested back into the building, which he gradually converted into a 54-room pension.
Since then, in seven years in the business, he gradually managed to open in Liberec four guesthouses, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of around 300 in all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of all was, until recently, the four-star design hotel Pytloun.
However, this year opened another one of the same quality.
“We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov or Tisé, to which we have sold our franchise concept, and other people are showing interest in a Pytloun franchise,” the No. 1 entrepreneur said last year.
“This sale of licenses for the opening of hotels greatly helped the fact of winning the ‘Entrepreneur of the Year’ contest,” Pytloun adds gratefully.
The victory increased his fame and popularity both in Liberec and the surrounding area.
“People recognized me on the street, they still congratulated me often and, I must say, I was very nice,” he recalls.
Without a doubt, it recommends everyone to try some company that participates in the contest.
But he believes that it is not necessary to win, but that participation is already beneficial.
He states that, so far, he continues to live on contacts and acquaintances that, without the competition, he might not have obtained.
"With some people I met thanks to the contest I started to collaborate regularly."
The fame associated with success, in his opinion, also included in the employees,
In total, about 70.
“I’ve seen them show greater loyalty and are proud to participate in something that gained general recognition.”
“It’s not, by any means, my own personal success, but it’s the result of the hard work of the whole team.”
“It’s only my name that appears on the front page,” Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun says modestly today.
To my successor I wish a quieter year than we have had in Farmet
The euphoria over the victory was soon dissipated by the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the hard work of the winner, it is possible that Farmet has already gone through the worst.
The owner of the Farmet company, Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>, received the first prize in the latest edition of Vodafone's "Company of the Year" competition, last year in the "Slavic House" in Prague.
The jury appreciated his efforts, with which he managed to turn a small technical workshop in <0xC4><0x8C>eská Skalice into a firm with a turnover of hundreds of millions.
“I can say that the award not only encouraged me, but all my collaborators and improved our confidence to fight against the competition,” says last year’s winner.
The history of the Farmet company begins with the desire to do something useful.
That is why, when the state proposed to Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>’s father the rental of a small workshop as compensation for the seizure of properties during communism, he did not hesitate too much; he resigned his position in the company in which he worked and, with a couple of colleagues, they founded the company with his father of plastic batteries.
Soon after, they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
Eight years later they became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in central Europe.
They obtained a greater presence also among the non-specialized public after achieving success in the contest in the media.
“Not only did our customers start to consider the Farmet brand as considerably better, but also foreign partners started to value the collaboration with a company that was more successful in their country,” says Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>.
Last year was perhaps not in Farmet only a sample of the euphoria of the victory.
It also gained recognition for its commercial results up to 2008 and, partially, 2009.
And 2009 was the hardest year for machinery sales.
The worsening of the crisis, which had not yet reached so many citizens, caused companies to stop their investment projects and begin to limit the purchase of new machines or technologies.
"We, of course, are not free of such a situation either."
“The revenues were reduced by 40%, we had to limit production and we even had some layoffs,” explains Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>.
A viable company must, at times, adopt even unpopular measures.
However, they controlled the situation and maintained the company’s profits, although at lower levels than before the crisis.
In spite of everything, where Farmet did not cut expenses was in research and development.
“With the grants we have built a research and training center, strengthened the presence in the international market and obtained magnificent valuations at national fairs,” says <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>.
Everything indicates that they have already left the crisis behind.
Revenues are rising again and, with them, the number of new employees.
“The new achievement is expected to bring a sense of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere,” says Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>.
A survey that reveals the ridiculous rules
The Absurdity of the Year survey is part of the business tournament for the fourth time.
It has already managed to eliminate some ridiculous rules.
The unknown winner of the new edition of the Absurdity of the Year survey was the obligation to bring to the administration documents that officials can access online.
The decision was taken by more than a third of the nearly 4,000 voters.
For example, the social security administration asked for an extract from the commercial register, although its officials can obtain it with two mouse movements.
Thanks to the survey, this has changed.
"The Czech social security administration will no longer ask for an extract from the commercial register when it carries out a check on the insured's taxes," <0xC4><0x8C>SSZ spokeswoman Jana Bura<0xC5><0x88>ová said.
The objective of the Absurdity of the Year survey is to consult the rules and regulations that companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic must respect and to try to eliminate those that are absurd.
This year for the fourth time he is part of the business tournament of the publication Hospodá<0xC5><0x99>ské noviny and begins to create a following among the general public.
While last year’s edition had the participation of three thousand voters, this year it practically reached four thousand.
And it is not surprising, since we still have several legal obligations to spare that must be respected simply to trade.
"Perhaps in the number of papers required for tax filing we are in first place worldwide," says Karel Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of business rules has been a stated goal of all governments for years.
However, compared to the rest of the world, the situation is improving especially in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, from the point of view of the conditions for having a company, the Czech Republic is in the 74th position, that is, eight places worse than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year contest was first held in 2006 and is repeated every year in the same way.
Anyone can indicate some administrative or bureaucratic absurdity every year between April and the end of September, when the contest closes.
Proposals can be made on the website www.firmaroku.cz. Afterwards, the organizer of the contest chooses seven candidates for the "anti-prize" and, during October, allows the public to vote on the Internet through www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
Win the absurdity that gets the most votes.
For this year’s survey, more than 100 were submitted, including 105 rules and regulations that make no sense.
The examples were sent by both businessmen and professional associations and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the competition was, for example, the requirement that vehicles for the maintenance of roads and highways pay the toll or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two bathrooms paint the walls every two years.
The list of this year’s seventy proposals is published on the pages of the contest.
The announcement of the contest, which always takes place at the beginning of November in Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of an event in which personalities from the political and social world usually participate.
This year, for example, the event was attended by Eva Svobodová, Director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic, and Petr Ku<0xC5><0xBE>el, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Republic.
"Economic prosperity cannot be sustained if the state continually puts obstacles in the way of entrepreneurs, so my goal is to eliminate every year a minimum of thirty paragraphs that currently unnecessarily complicate trade," announced Minister of Industry and Trade Martin Kocourek.
Efforts to eliminate absurd regulations do not stay in borage water.
In 2007, what bothered people the most was the employer's obligation to communicate three days in advance to the business office of the permanent operating area, the intention to go with a post at a fair or exhibition.
This obligation was eliminated in the new industrial law.
The obligation that ended second in number of votes in 2007, i.e. communication to the labor office by its foreign workers of work trips of up to 30 days, was eliminated in the so-called green card law.
The third one is the winner.
The Absurdity of 2009 was the regulation for physiotherapists to have in their consultation a large mirror, a refrigerator and two floor scales.
Therefore, this year the Ministry of Health issued a communication saying that it had eliminated the obligation to have a refrigerator.
A new category recognizes socially responsible companies
Ecological, humanitarian, educational or sports projects are valued.
The novelty in this fifth edition of the Hospodá<0xC5><0x99>ské noviny contest is the category called Responsible Company of the year 2010.
The purpose of this competition is to support responsible and fair companies.
“In this way we want to support companies that deal with the impact of their activity on the environment and that support socially responsible activities,” says Patrik Bartholdy, regional director of the mobile operator of the company Vodafone, organizer and sponsor of the contest, as in the case of the Rebel of the Year contest.
For this new special subcategory of this year’s edition of Vodafone Empresa’s main competition of the year 2010, companies were presented for which commercial success is not the only long-term objective.
The story of each of them is inspiring and would allow us to write an independent article.
Although the type of activities varies completely from one to the other, the common denominator is the support and consideration they offer.
In one case, it involves disabled people, in another, personal or health problems of employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Republic was, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera, which supports the formation of informal sports teams among its workers, who then participate in tournaments of various sports.
Another example of a company responsible for the Pardubice area is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has already been the main donor of funds to sponsor disabled children for seven years.
In Pod<0xC4><0x9B>brad, there is a stationery company that is particularly concerned with the health problems of its workers, since they constitute more than 70% of the workforce; for this reason it received the title of Company responsible for the central area of Czechia and in the Vodafone Company of the year competition it finished third in the region.
In Olomouc won the accounting firm MiRyz Soft, which reduced working hours, even below the average of 35 hours per week, without reducing wages.
The title was also awarded because it primarily buys from Czech manufacturers, supports community activities in the area and respects the environment.
“We try to recycle as much as possible so that our production and management activities produce the least possible impact on the environment,” explains entrepreneur Milu<0xC5><0xA1>e Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> region also thinks about the health of its employees and, with each laptop, offered them an ergonomic chair and keyboards; in addition, it supports work from home and at its business events uses the catering services of a local protected company.
“In addition, we support the Person in Distress grant, which specifically helps the local Roma community,” says Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Such<0xC3><0xBD>.
The Karlovy Vary region's Pran<0xC3><0xAD> a <0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>n<0xC3><0xAD> laundry company, whose employees receive special bonuses that have an impact on their pension funds, is also well-placed with a mention.
“We give benefits in food, transport, improving qualifications and leisure,” says Josef Strapa<0xC4><0x8D> of Bruntál Czasch construction company, winner in the Moravian-Silesian region.
In the Responsible Company of the Year category, all regional finalists of the Vodafone Company of the Year competition who answered the questions on the registration form were automatically nominated and sent to the organisers before 15 August.
The organizers removed forms that were not complete or wrong from the evaluation.
"If the representatives of the contesting companies did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the Responsible Company of the Year contest, but they are not disqualified from the "main" Vodafone Company of the Year contest."
“Individual entries for this competition are not permitted, as this is a subcategory of the main Company of the Year competition,” explains Karel Goldman of Bison & Rose.
Police made arrests during a public auction at the Agricultural Fund building in Pilsen
Anti-corruption police made several arrests at the Agricultural Fund building in recent days.
Detectives handcuffed a local media entrepreneur and real estate entrepreneur Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G.
It seems that this attempt to manipulate an ongoing public auction for the restitution of rights in such a way that the auctioned land would be received by a precise interested party.
He had to pay Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. half a million kroner for it.
"At the moment I can only say that the police are looking for a person for bribery during a public auction and public tender," Pilsen chief prosecutor Antonie Zelená told Právo, adding that for the time being she could not divulge further details about the ongoing investigation.
After 24 hours, police released the 46-year-old businessman.
On the way in which it could influence the public auction, given the little official information, one can only speculate.
The spokeswoman for the Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>ra <0xC4><0x8C>erná Agricultural Fund responded to Právo’s questions by saying that the police actually carried out the arrest at the Pilsen headquarters and it was during a public auction.
“This is a customer, not one of our employees,” he said.
According to <0xC4><0x8C>erná, the public auction is called "Call for proposals for land transfer in accordance with the Land Law" and is carried out when several interested parties appear in relation to the offered land.
"These people, during the call, offer a value higher than that of their restitution, which must be transferred before the value of the land is announced."
"Based on the offers, the order of buyers is determined and then the Agricultural Fund transfers the land to the person offering the highest offer," the Fund spokeswoman explained.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. had information as to who was to be invited to the auction and, since he was also an interested person because he had acquired various rights of restitution, he proposed to those interested in the land that he would not participate in the auction.
For that, he was charging a commission.
This would explain why, at the time of the arrest, he had so much money on him.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. had special contacts in the Pilsen Fund for a long time.
It was in the case of the former head of the PF, Václav Sankot, who was charged with clearing the replacement of land for which a construction decision had already been issued.
For example, Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. has just obtained land from the Fund for the construction of public infrastructure, in particular on the site where a major road should be built to the industrial area of Borská pole.
Later, he exchanged them in a very beneficial way with the magistrate for a house in the historic center of the city with a much higher value.
In this case, the city council had to intervene because, otherwise, the blocked land would prevent construction.
Families will have to pay additional expenses of several hundred kroner per month
Households will have to pay from January not only for all types of energy, but also for water and electricity, heating supplements and, in some cases, higher rents.
As a result, families will have to take several hundred kroner more out of their wallets from January than they do now.
The price of electricity rises by 4.6%, gas by around 2%, in some cities they will have to pay up to 10% more for the water supply and many also increase the price of central heating.
The rise in electricity for families living in apartments should amount to about 100 kroner more per year than now.
However, the main electricity suppliers reduced prices, as support for energy production from renewable sources, in particular photovoltaics, has increased.
However, the gas is moderately expensive, especially at the time when heating is used the most and, therefore, the consumption is higher.
In this case, they must also count on a couple of hundred more crowns a year.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive across the country, the price change for central heating varies from place to place.
The increase in prices is mainly planned by the largest municipality.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Králové will pay about 50 kroner a month for central heating from January, while families in Liberec will pay more than 1,000 kroner a year.
Residents in Prague will also have to bear a 9% increase in the price of water and heating, especially if the city increases the rental of infrastructure.
If the rent does not vary, Praguens will pay an additional 6.8%.
Prices in Prague, however, will continue to be among the lowest in the entire country.
In northern Bohemia, where current prices are among the highest, both rates will rise by 7.4%.
The rental prices of 450,000 rented apartments in Prague, where the regulation will end in January, can increase considerably.
For example, the company CPI Byty, which owns about 2,500 apartments in <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem, will increase the rent from January by up to 100%.
The company will take to court those who disagree with the new lease.
Regulated rents, which benefit residents of about 300,000 flats, could rise as much as 10 percent next year.
Young Czechs get drunk with Fernet and rum. Beer is no longer in mode, because it slowly takes effect
Fernet, rum, vodka and even good whiskeys stolen from their parents.
Those are the drinks that cause young drinkers under the age of fifteen to end up in medical care.
Children who end up lying in the hospital continuously to overcome the hangover are no longer an exception.
This stems from the experience of doctors who encounter such cases in hospital pediatric admissions.
"Drinking beer or wine is no longer fashionable, because they take a long time to get drunk."
"Now the fashion is strong alcoholic beverages," Lud<0xC4><0x9B>k Pelikán, head of pediatrics at Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice Hospital in central Bohemia, tells Právo.
"When they manage to get a bottle to their father from the pantry, it may be whiskey, but it's usually Fernet and vodka."
“Vodka has the advantage that it is lightened with juice and doesn’t smell as much,” he explains.
This is also confirmed by the spokesperson of the Motol University Hospital, Eva Jurinová.
"Usually it's Fernet or rum."
“Those are modern alcoholic beverages, particularly among schoolchildren.”
“In some cases, they use brandy that they picked up at home,” Jurinová adds.
According to Chief Pelikán, they are thirteen- and fourteen-year-old drinkers who usually appear in hospitals.
Before Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for a decade in pediatrics in Motol, where ambulances took young people from nearby areas.
"A girl had to come in maybe four times."
“It started at the age of twelve, when she was brought in with 3.5 of alcohol in her blood, in addition to a mixture with ecstasy,” the department doctor says of this case.
"He was at the Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice fair at some dance party."
“The interesting thing is that his mother wasn’t even surprised that her daughter disappeared for 48 hours,” the boss said.
It is precisely the parents’ lack of interest or even their children’s clear tolerance for drinking that is considered the main cause of the increase in alcohol consumption among young people.
Experts point out that, in the case of children, one cannot properly speak of dependence.
"Alcoholic is understood to be a person who has a chronic dependence on alcohol for several years, with all the phenomena associated with it, which does not occur in children."
"In those who drink alcohol repeatedly, it is rather due to a systematically failed social or family environment," explains Chief Pelikan.
According to spokeswoman Jurinová, this year in the pediatric clinic of Motol forty drunken children were hospitalized until mid-November.
However, statistics only show those who come with severe poisoning and must remain in the hospital.
Young drinkers who, after the walking medical examination, go home with their parents or with the police, do not count.
In addition to the cases in which children simply gather after school and drink brandy, for Pelikán there are three seasonal ups and downs that should be mentioned: the day of witches, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"In such a circumstance, they drink for the bad notes or, on the contrary, they celebrate the beginning of the holidays."
“On Witch Day, I’ve seen up to seven drunk children admitted at a time,” Pelikan adds.
Drinkers who spend the night in detoxification under the supervision of doctors, paradoxically, have the advantage that the next day they do not suffer a terrible hangover at home.
The morning headache, caused by dehydration and lack of glucose, is avoided with the injection of a serum with glucose and with the nutrients that the body lacks.
"They take it much better, because after the hectic night, they get up well and nothing hurts."
“They’re just confused about where they are,” says Pelikán, adding that patients often lose their temper at least when they see the expenses they’ve incurred.
Ambulance and hospitalization in a room for critically ill patients can cost tens of thousands of kroner.
“I have often used the cost as a means of educating them, when on the visit I tell the children directly how much their drunkenness has cost and that they would have to spend the whole summer in a job for young people so that you would earn enough to pay for that night,” Pelikán adds.
Health insurance, in his opinion perhaps as a regressive measure, which usually reimburses people for the costs of treatment, does not do so in the case of children who drink.
Two L-159 aircraft are in third-party hands for the first time in Spain
Two L-159 aircraft out of a total of five, for which the Czech Ministry of Defense replaced the Casa C-295M aircraft, departed on Tuesday for Seville, where the manufacturer of the Casa - EADS aircraft is located.
It is the first time such a device has been found in the hands of anyone other than the Czech army.
At the moment, they were only abroad to carry out internship or demonstration flights.
This is the two-seater version L-159T1, which until now was used by the Czech army and was still in a state of flight.
The remaining three aircraft are the L-159 single-seaters.
These are still preserved in Aer Vodochody and the intermediary of the sale, the company Omnipol, already took care of them last week.
Jan Peje<0xC5><0xA1>k, from the defence press department, says it is not yet known when the planes will be physically removed from Vodochody.
"The single-seat L-159 aircraft, on the other hand, were separated from the long-repaired aircraft, without additional investments or contributions from the Ministry."
"The L-159T1 two-seaters were exchanged in their current state," he told Pravo Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
He added that the army does not run out of two-seater aircraft, since in May 2009 the army signed a contract with Aer Vodochody for an amount of 200 million crowns for the construction of four unnecessary L-159 devices for two-seaters.
One of the new aircraft was already received by the army in July, the other will be delivered at the end of the year.
According to Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, EADS pledged that the aircraft would be added to the equipment of some allied countries.
"The contract clearly indicates that EADS is the one that is retiring the L-159 aircraft and that they will be used for pilot practices in NATO countries."
“It is therefore up to the buyer to decide how they will use them in this framework,” says Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
The newspaper Hospodá<0xC5><0x99>ské noviny published ahead of time that, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159s.
The exchange of five L-159s for a Casa aircraft and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns were approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defence did not call a tender for the purchase and negotiated directly with EADS.
The current Directorate of Defense states that the exchange promotes the future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army acquired 72 Aer aircraft and uses only 24, so it wants to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa aircraft may have legal consequences.
The European Commission has already denounced the Czech Ministry of Defence to the European Court of Justice because it should choose the aircraft by conducting a European tender and not by contacting a single manufacturer.
The army has already received three Casa planes and the last one should arrive at the Prague airport of Kbely in fourteen days.
A index finger longer than the ring finger indicates a lower risk of cancer.
Men who have the index longer than the annulus are at a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday in a British journal on cancer.
It could depend on the level of testosterone, the male hormone.
"Our results indicate that relative finger length may be a simple test of prostate cancer risk, particularly for men up to the age of 60," said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
Therefore, the finger could help determine which men should be tested for prostate cancer, particularly if this characteristic is associated with a genetic risk or other harmful factors, such as family health problems, Eeles says.
During the period 1994-2009, he followed up with a British counterpart more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and, simultaneously, 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the study participants had their right indica finger shorter than their ring finger.
They were just as likely to get prostate cancer as 19% of those whose fingers were the same length.
In the case of men with a longer index than the ring finger, this risk was reduced by 33%; for men under the age of 60% the reduction reached 87%.
The relationship between the length of the two fingers in question, determined in the prenatal period, reflects different levels of hormones to which the fetus is exposed in the womb.
A lower testosterone level corresponds to a longer index.
Previous studies have indicated that testosterone influences the development of prostate cancer.
The great Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, Professor Václav Pa<0xC4><0x8D>es, told <0xC4><0x8C>TK that he is aware of the study, but that it does not seem to him that the relationship between finger length and cancer can be "fully demonstrated".
Czech Republic under snow: D1 and D5 closed
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, was covered in snow on Thursday.
Roads and sidewalks are mainly covered by compact snow and snow-removing machines circulated throughout the night in numerous areas.
In the morning the D5 road was closed between km 89 and 93 in the direction of Rozvadov due to several accidents of commercial vehicles and passenger cars, as was the D1 in Brno in the direction of Prague.
The news was transmitted by the operator of the <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC5><0x99>edn<0xC3><0xAD>ho automotoklubu (<0xC3><0x9A>AMK).
At kilometer 91 a truck broke down, in the 93 collided two commercial vehicles that caused injuries.
Also several cars ended up in the ditch.
There are also problems on the D1 motorway at kilometer 185 in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks collided there.
Drivers must drive slowly past Brno at kilometre 190 or cross Brno and take up at kilometre 182 in K<0xC3><0xBD>valce.
Traffic jams of several kilometers have formed there.
There has also been an accident on the D11 road, right next to Prague.
Prague is covered by several centimetres of snow and thermometers indicate -7oC.
Traffic jams are forming for example in Prosek, although <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>rboholská is also congested.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
Trams run late, for example on the line between Karlovo nám<0xC4><0x9B>st<0xC3><0xAD> and Nám<0xC4><0x9B>st<0xC3><0xAD> M<0xC3><0xAD>ru.
At eight in the morning, there will be another state of crisis in Prague.
The problems also affect the railways and the airport.
Because of the snow, the Czech railway company had to cancel seven connections for three fast.
The problems affect, for example, the line between Prague and Kralupy or Prague and Beroun.
Travellers should check what the current situation is.
The Ruzyn<0xC4><0x9B> airport was closed from 11 p.m. on Wednesday until 5 a.m.
Currently, you can already drive on most of the roads in southern Moravia, but with extreme caution.
In Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kovska three secondary roads are closed to traffic, in Brn<0xC4><0x9B>nska snow tongues are forming and in Blanenska chains are needed to access certain access roads to the highest points.
One of the places most affected was Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kovsko.
So far the connections are closed: Rous<0xC3><0xAD>nov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Ku<0xC4><0x8D>erov and also <0xC5><0xA0>aratice - Mile<0xC5><0xA1>ovice.
To clear them, milling machines will be required.
At the moment it is not possible to say when they will open to the circulation.
In Hodon<0xC3><0xAD>nska, caution is required in the area of the B<0xC3><0xAD>lé Karpaty (White Carpathians).
Roads in the region that, as a protected natural area, must simply be left inert, accumulate up to five centimetres of snow, according to <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
In the Czech Republic, between two and ten centimeters of snow fell, more in northern Bohemia, where the snow cover reaches 18 centimeters.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, about 15 centimeters of snow fell.
Snowfall is gradually falling in the Czech Republic.
American soldiers have a new "smart weapon"
The U.S. military is using a new “smart” weapon in Afghanistan, known for the moment only by the codename XM-25.
The generals hoped the new rifle would influence the local conflict with the Taliban and "change the progress of the game" towards their victory.
The new weapons are like a small gun with extremely precise aim.
Their bullets are fired with a laser with an accuracy of several meters.
The special 25mm calibre ammunition created for this rifle and the high explosive load it contains causes it to actually function as a small grenade.
The projectiles can be programmed to explode not only when they hit the target, but at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
They can be used against enemies hiding behind an obstacle, a wall or a trench.
No doubt, normal protection cannot be used, and when you throw your murderous rain of metal splinters, it can prove essential in battle.
According to Richard Audette, who spoke about the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use “smart” technology.
"The soldiers manipulate it in such a way that they find the target, they point their laser beam at it, which determines the distance, then it obtains a precise point of sight and, depending on it, corrects the projection line and pulls the trigger."
"Let's say they've measured 543 meters."
“When the trigger is pressed, the weapon is loaded and launches the projectile at a distance of 543 meters, plus minus one, two or three meters,” says Audette.
400 jobs have been moved.
The Fujitsu consortium moves its Bad Homburg branch to Frankfurt.
In July of the following year, 400 employees will move their workplace from their previous office building on Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese consortium Fujitsu moves its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the computer giant reported on Wednesday, 400 men and women will move in July of the following year from its previous office building on Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large office complex on Lyoner Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e in Frankfurt’s Niederrad district.
A spokeswoman for Fujitsu said that in the medium term another 100 employees of the consortium, which were previously scattered throughout the region, will stay there.
The offer is highly attractive, in addition the collective office in Astro Park will favor the way of working of the employees.
In addition, Fujitsu will be the only tenant in Bad Homburg.
Director Bernd Wagner said, "In Franfkurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure."
The brilliant connection to the airport is very important today for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of a major company in the region yesterday caused joy among those who were in favor and disappointment among those who were against.
Frankfurt economics section chief Markus Frank (CDU) said that has earned him a "Global Player".
This is a "magnificent recognition of the site."
Fujitsu is based in the city, the settlement is a big boost for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bod Hombruger, Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regrets Fujitsu’s decision.
The management has previously informed the city of its intention.
"We have naturally offered the company our help," Korwisi said.
However, the good contacts of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property in Marienbader Platz have not been able to change in the difficulties.
After all, the economic reasons led to the fall.
In such a way, there is now a great empty place to cover in the famous post.
"I expect the owner and landlord of the building to be cooperative."
The building formerly used by Fujitsu on Rathausplatz and the neighbouring "Kleine Vertikale" were part of the remaining buildings of Marienbader Platz for ten years in a controversial project to build the spa town.
As a joint project of the city and a private project company between the station and the town hall, a new entrance to the city is formed, which is in charge of the criticism in terms of the massive building that previously used the gaps as parking spaces and in terms of the level of the buildings.
In 2001 the investment advisory and appraisal companies, the manufacturer of software for reservation systems, Start Amadeus, were installed, as well as then joined Siemens with the computer manufacturer Fujitsu.
In 2006, the building used by Fujitsu was acquired by the Frankfurt real estate group, Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe together with Morgan Stanley Real Estate and a year later resold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
Fujitsu, a Tokyo-based consortium, is recognized as the world’s third largest IT provider.
It has companies, such as computers and servers, and also provides the necessary services.
The branch in Rhein-Main-Gebiet is one of the largest in Germany, however Fujitsu has more business in Munich.
The Fujitsu Technology Solutions subsidiary is located in Bad Homburg in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the following subsidiaries at this location will be Fujitsu Services and a company by the name of TDS.
That is why 7,000 square meters have been rented in the Astro Park office building.
The old complex of the 1920s, its name alludes to its star-shaped plane, houses among others the central association of electrotechnics and the electronics industry.
Amazon cancels server - Threats against Assange
Anguish is increasingly taking over Wikileaks.
Internet service provider Amazon has removed the disclosure platform from its server.
Political pressure is likely behind the release of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic documents.
Assange, the founder of Wikileaks, is reportedly detained in England.
The Wikileaks disclosure platform is always the target of ever-stronger criticism in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their former American server and are currently seeking an internet homeland in Europe.
U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman has called on other countries and businesses to boycott WikiLeaks.
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol’s wanted list, must remain in detention in Britain, according to an article.
"Wikileaks kicked out of Amazon server."
“Speaking freely in the country of freedom,” activists reported the revelations via the Twitter messaging service on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the internet company, Amazon, had removed the Wikileaks documents from its server.
Internet activists had resorted to publishing secret diplomatic documents on the Amazon services website in order to cope with the high figures of access to the documents.
On Twitter, Wikileaks explained: "Perfect, we will use our dollars to hire people in Europe."
If Amazon has problems with free speech, “they should stop selling books.”
Amazon stopped using its server through Wikileaks, after an employee of Sen. Joe Lieberman had requested investigations, CNN reported, according to a call to Lieberman’s office.
The presidency of the senate council for the security of the country had threatened Amazon with boycott, reported the British "Guardian".
“I had wished that Amazon would take these steps earlier, prior to previous releases of classified information through Wikileaks,” he said.
Lieberman also requested that the platform also ban the use of the server in other countries.
“WikiLeaks’ illegal, monstrous and reckless process jeopardizes our national security and threatens life in the world,” the independent senator said in a statement.
“No responsible company, whether American or foreign, should help WikiLeaks with its service to spread stolen material.
WikiLeaks founder Assange, who is wanted in Sweden on suspicion of rape, is on Interpol’s wanted list.
According to an article in the London newspaper The Independent, the 39-year-old Australian is detained in Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact place.
The internet activist has consistently branded the investigation in Sweden as a plot by his enemy.
WikiLeaks spokeswoman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that threats had been made.
“There were even calls about a murder of Julian Assange.”
That’s why Assange’s safety is feared, Hrafnsson said.
The location of the Wikileaks founder remains undisclosed.
Hrafnsson evidently reacted to the statements of North America.
In America, former Arkansas Republican Gov. Mike Huckabee said the person responsible for the Wikileaks revelations should be tried for treason and should be executed.
In Canada, an adviser to Prime Minister Stephen Harper stated, clearly with irony, on television, Assange should “be killed” and Obama could “use a drone.”
Between the White House and Assange grows a great dispute.
Robert Gibbs, the spokesman for US President Barack Obama, called it “ridiculous and absurd” that Assange has called for the resignation of the secretary of state, in case she is responsible for recently ordering diplomats to engage in espionage tasks.
“I’m not entirely sure why we should care about a guy’s opinion on a website,” Gibbs said.
“Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much stronger than their website.”
The U.S. government needs to demonstrate the effectiveness of protecting its databases in general.
Russell Travers, deputy director of distribution at the National Counterterrorism Center, was named as an exceptional charge, the White House announced.
Travers is responsible for developing “the important structural reforms” that are needed in light of the WikiLeaks leak.
The White House also wants to inspect the roads, as well as change the total information about the government and protect it.
In addition, the U.S. government announced that to take care of the safety of dissidents and activists, they must jeopardize the publication of WikiLeaks.
“We have done everything we can to get in touch with them,” State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said.
“We are prepared to help protect them if necessary.”
The University of Ice Cream
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice cream parlors are prepared at the best times of the year.
The three-day basic course for future ice cream makers has the maximum affluence and visitors from all over the world.
Where does all the ice cream actually come from?
The ice cream parlour and the ice cream parlour.
The gelatiere makes the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of making ice cream.
The gelataio takes the cream from the ice cream counter with a spatula, spreads it on the wafer and sells it.
To know this, you do not need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But who wants to know more about ice cream, should not visit the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The manufacturer has equipped the university of ice cream with the freezer in 2003, so that the ice cream of its machines meets the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future ice cream makers has the maximum affluence and visitors from all over the world.
There are also more special courses of more days on chocolate ice cream and practices in the ice cream parlor of the house itself.
In these times of crisis, some dream of a new professional career, others risk their vague desires in the soft ice cream.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia through Hungary.
Jacky, a teacher of this art from California, loves the slow movement of food and in the future wants to offer a quality European product in the land of industrial ice cream.
Anke, from Berlin, is a business consultant and wants to create something of her own in a few years within an annoying job.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream parlor in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and a Canadian housewife, Julia, comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
The master ice cream maker Luciano Ferrari explains to the participants afterwards the ideal qualities of the perfect ice cream.
Not only its good taste is decisive, but also its silky softness and good consistency.
Luciano does not forget his training nor the cream cover of the national and mainly southern superior house of the country: "Italian ice cream is simply the best, and that's why every ball has something romantic."
The first step in preparation seems very easy.
Luciano pours the basic ingredients: milk, cream, powdered milk, sugar and stabilizers into a large blender, which heats everything with an electronic program up to 85 degrees and instantly cools it down to four degrees.
Then open the tap of the machine and a pasteurized white basic cream comes out, the base for all types of milk ice cream.
Suddenly, the professor asks: Can the ice cream be made with only natural elements or without a stabilizer?
How can you give free rein to some desire to experiment?
Luciano advises to avoid the trends of the time.
The one who speaks of ice cream "not only of natural ingredients", has perhaps used stabilizers, mainly a natural product, probably guar gum, of guar bean.
Of course you can make ice cream without stabilizer, you only have to buy it one day, place it in a bag and the customer will bite a sound granite ice cream.
Certain variations in the basic mass are allowed.
Aromas are used.
As for the taste of ice cream, master Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients that are bought in the fruit section or in the candy section of the supermarket.
In addition, there are powders and pastes.
"All suppliers will try to sneak flavored ingredients into their merchandise."
"Nevertheless you must experience it sometime."
Either with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or even with the ice cream of the basic white dough, which with eggs will become a yellow cream and with cocoa powder as the basis for all the possible pleasures of chocolate.
Now course participants can use the ice cream machines.
Luciano allows them to make four different types of vanilla ice cream, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut, with or without eggs in the basic dough, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural ingredients.
They perform the same experiment also with types of fruit ice cream.
That you know better does not necessarily depend on you having more toffee aroma or more fruit puree.
It is not necessary for hazelnut ice cream to taste nuts, if it contains more hazelnuts.
The task force makes the beloved kiwi ice cream, which uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
First, a balanced mix highlights the flavor of the ice cream, says Luciano.
The preparation of ice cream is an artifact problem: Peach puree with a lot of sugar is used, the proportion of sugar in the basic recipe must be reduced.
For lemon ice cream you need an extra portion of sugar.
Luciano takes out a utensil with which he fixes the amount of sugar of the types of fruits (measurement of the winemaker for Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make it easier to count.
Making ice cream does not require more than the physical application, as before.
Not only does the utensil help for the automatic preparation of the basic dough.
There is also a utensil, in which the prepared ice cream mixture is simultaneously beaten and cooled to a temperature below zero.
In spite of everything, all the automation is left out as far as the small pasta is concerned.
Brazilian Gustavo smears himself and his companions from top to bottom with fruit puree, as if it were an uncontrollable giant mini-first.
"In all courses," says Luciano, "it's only a matter of time before something like this happens."
Inspectors in a complicated situation
The European food safety authority EFSA has infiltrated the industry experimenting with transgenic plants.
This issue is currently being formulated by the Testbiotech expert group, which is considered to be an institute for independent assessment of the impact of biotechnology.
“It sounds like a conspiracy theory but we haven’t documented it well,” Christoph Then, director of Testbiotech, said Wednesday in Munich.
Harry Kuiper, the director of Efsa’s expert group on genetically modified plants, and another Efsa expert have also been employed for years in the Ilsi association.
Consortiums such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer pay for it.
Kuiper has collaborated significantly on Efsa’s testing standards for genetically modified plants, which puts him in a clear conflict of interest, Then says.
Efsa’s provisions are in paragraphs with the same terms with the documentation of Ilsi’s situation and mimic the deed of the company, which is actually controlled by its Italian authorities in Parma.
This is the second time that Testbiotech has criticized a collision of interests.
Thus, recently, a high-ranking manager of Efsa went without the support nor the time of transition to the Swiss Agrarkonzern Syngenta, and has changed with that his side.
Recently, also Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) revealed personal connections between EU inspection authorities and industry, which were made by the General Environment Office as well as an EU parliamentary clairvoyant.
However, Efsa cannot recognise any conflict of interest.
All formal data, including some from the industry, are used, provided that they are of a high technical quality, ordered in a report.
Experts working at EFSA are not required to have no contact with the industry.
But they must expose these contacts.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) in the US
It calls itself a neutral forum for experts and science, industry and policy, among others for risk assessment for biotechnology without the Lobby’s mandate.
Independent experts, such as Then, criticise the fact that transgenic plants are currently allowed without researching food for animals and that the influence of genetically modified plants on the environment is not verified.
“We want to know what, for example, genetically modified maize does in agriculture,” says Then.
Current practice is to test only isolated proteins, but not the entire transgenic plant, which does not provide reliable results.
“If you don’t look for the risks, how are you going to find them?” asks accuser, Then.
Angelina Hilbeck feels the same way.
She has been researching the field of genetic engineering since 1994 and currently works at the Technical Institute in Zurich.
In this area, the industry is increasingly trying, in the US and Europe, to influence or discredit critical scientists.
Therefore, there are few scientists who are not influenced by consortia.
For companies, critical studies are not usually published.
“Industry controls safety research,” Hilbeck maintains.
The Trail of the Stones
Uli Gsell has gained some, in total about 400 kilos.
On Monday I was in front of the Stuttgart station, with the Tuba behind me.
There were demonstrations
Snow.
The story is well known: In September the excavators arrived and began to shoot down a large chunk of the north wing.
The land of Stuttgart was never the same again: Thousands and thousands demonstrated against the s21, suspending millions at the station.
As it was sealed, most of the wing became rubble.
Broken into 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a rough soft stone, erected between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, he is 43 years old.
A couple of pieces have been secured.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
Enthusiast: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and natural."
As he once said, he has smelled the smoke from cigarettes.
He still doesn't know what he'll do with the pieces.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The trail of the Stuttgart stones leads to a forest in Tubingen in a former munitions depot of the French Navy, where Manuel Rongen erected his Stein-Reich stone.
The 44-year-old man deals with ancient stones.
He has bought everything resulting from the demolition in Stuttgart.
“There would be dishonor, they would grind the gravel or send it to the dump,” he says in his office, a wooden house that was once a guardhouse.
He was insulted and threatened, he explains, when, in September, he appeared in the newspapers, that he had bought the remains of the north wing from the shoot-down company.
He spoke with the enemies of 21S for several days.
And he explained to them that he could do absolutely nothing about the shooting down.
And when it happened, then it was most reasonable, when the stones continued to be used.
About 200 enemies of the S21 took the 80-kilogram mace cut, with a price per piece of 6.50 to 14 euros.
Some took it as a souvenir but also with the hope of being able to return it in a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, a cargo of 25 trucks.
Approximately half is still in the forest, the rest has long been sold.
Owner of gardens, landscape gardener, project manager.
They came from everywhere and took what they could carry in the trunk and on top.
The Stuttgart stone of momentum has long since become "the wall" or the delimitation of Kr<0xC3><0xA4>uterbeeten.
“This stone is really nothing special,” Rongen says.
"If it weren't for the political component."
He ascends to his all-terrain vehicle, makes a tour of his great kingdom of 20 hectares.
He studied law, interrupted his studies, and later biology, he is interested in computers and finally works with stones.
He is a lover of stones.
It houses 4,000 tons of stone.
It transports its treasures throughout Germany.
He claims to be the largest ancient stone dealer in the country.
Brake.
In the snow there are artistic chopped sandstone stones.
“They belonged to the Dresden Marienbr<0xC3><0xBC>cke bridge,” he explains.
White limestone, yellow, warm, gets excited.
"My dear stone."
The road crosses the forest.
He points out a lot: Red sandstone, an earlier piece of Karlsruhe station.
And go on.
"Nice travertine."
Formerly, the masizos belonged to the grandstand of the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow, stones and stories, yellow travertine from the Stuttgart police headquarters, red granite from the Sankt Blasien church, tuff from the Heilbronner hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how he carved the stones before and moved them with a simple rig and a cart, he feels very devoted.
"It would be a scandal if something were destroyed."
He didn’t get rich, not at all immensely rich.
But today 14 people made the stone dealer, in addition to stonemasons, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glassmaker and a gardener have settled up in the forest.
“We work hard, but it’s satisfying,” says the man in charge of taking advantage of the wreckage.
He has to go to Cologne soon.
There are also stones to rescue.
Talent struggle around great potentials
There is an active affluence in the buffet.
16 students crowd around muffins, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and car manufacturer Vokswagen have invited mechanical engineering and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of contest of ideas, they have to talk about the car of the future with the VW workers and also learn everything about Volkswagen.
Rivalling and in the same way, many companies, like VW, come together in a hand-to-hand struggle around the most privileged minds in collaborations with universities.
Their mission: Hire the most talented students from universities as soon as possible, before they enter the job market and are hired by others.
And since universities do not provide publications about the skills of their students, they try to catch a glimpse of exceptional talents in practical projects and capture them.
On the second day of the project at the Technical University Braunscheig, the consortium wins over the talents.
A lady from the personnel department distributes pens, erasers and folders with the VW logo.
It explains internship programs and student jobs to enthusiastic young talents and shows them their paths in the consortium.
Nico Selle of the Technical University of Braunschweig leads the project with VW.
See advantages for both parties: "Students get in touch with the industry and gain experience."
“In turn, VW can get to know the students, look more closely at interesting candidates and consider them as potential future workers.”
Some collaborations, Selle says, are not uncommon.
The novelty is that students are desired so directly.
“The main point previously was in technical projects,” says Selle.
The fight for fresh graduates is getting tougher.
In many industries, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large pool of applicants.
If not they have to advertise themselves and, above all, to get a highly qualified workforce.
All students from engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating situation.
According to the German Association of Engineers (VDI), there were 40,000 vacant engineering positions in October.
And, according to the VDI’s forecasts, this void of engineers will grow even more.
At the audit and advisory firm, KPMG, Roman Dykta is in charge of talent hunting.
He organizes expensive recruitment events, such as the KPMG race, a type of modern yincana, in which participants have to find their way through GPS coordinates.
The company wants to send eight very promising students to the U.S. next year.
In addition, participants can observe KPMG subsidiaries and learn about the company.
It is decided who should go in two rounds of choice at the start.
Only the cr<0xC3><0xA8>me de la cr<0xC3><0xA8>me of many participants goes to the U.S.
Universities are increasingly striving to choose and polish the high potentials of universities, according to Dykta.
"With the race we want to stand out from the crowd."
"The simple journey alone was short."
For the Dykta scout the notes give results.
"To date we have a similar action in the last year with all participants."
“Some are nearing their end, and they want to apply to work with us,” he says.
In addition to the direct approach on campus, they are also hunting, especially small and medium-sized companies, classic with their labor fairs.
"We try to get students at the trade fairs."
“Something about Intersolar,” says Sitha St<0xC3><0xBC>be, head of staff for solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonner company has approximately 1,500 employees in Germany.
St<0xC3><0xBC>be knows the problems of the new generation.
There are currently 35 vacancies on the company’s website.
"It is very difficult to fill the vacancies."
“It costs a lot of time and money,” he says.
A shorter path is contact with university professors.
Solarworld collaborates with several higher schools, for example, the University of Freiberg.
"Teachers advise that you can do internships with us or do your thesis.
There are no expensive advertising campaigns for solar specialists.
That is why the company needs to promote itself with other advantages: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchy and comfortable communication.
“A large consortium can’t usually offer it,” says St<0xC3><0xBC>be, the head of staff.
In the search for a job, money is no longer the most important thing.
The decisive factors are flexible working hours, assistance to children or good chances of promotion.
According to a study by the Great Place to Work Institutes, Solarworld ranks 55th among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The institute draws up an annual list of the best German job providers.
For what asks the employee how satisfied he is with the work and with the environment in it and observes the previous conditions of the employees.
St<0xC3><0xBC>be, the staff manager also expects extra points in her ranking for her job seekers.
“I think the applicant looks especially at the external ratings of a potential employer,” he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the Deutschen Employer Branding Akademie advises companies that want a long-term strategy to earn a good reputation as employers.
Advise your customers more authenticity.
And that means, according to Kriegler, above all, internal measures.
“The best way to become attractive as an employer is through the employees themselves,” he says.
In the jargon of the sector it is called Internal Employer Branding, also promotion of corporate identity within the staff itself.
“Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors.”
When you treat people well and identify them with the company, then you get promotion directly to the employer from friends and acquaintances.
“It’s like a gang game,” Kriegler says.
Obama Stops New Oil Drilling
From the coast of the U.S. state of Florida to the Gulf of Mexico, no new oil drilling has appeared in recent years.
The Washington government issued a strong ban and with it annulled its previous plans in an unappealable way.
Also in front of the Atlantic coast new drillings remain closed for the moment.
This was announced by Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
What prompted this strict ban, which will be in place for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in April.
Before the disaster that claimed the lives of 11 workers and caused the largest environmental catastrophe in the US, President Barack Obama had admitted new drilling in the western part of the Gulf of Mexico under pressure from the opposition and industry.
Supporters wanted to reduce U.S. dependence on new oil supplies from abroad.
To date, it has not been fully clarified who is responsible for the irreparable oil spill in the Gulf.
At the center of the criticism is the British energy consortium BP, which is faced with millions of demands.
A commission of inquiry commissioned by Obama will present its findings in December.
In October, Ken Salazar, the interior minister, lifted the moratorium on drilling after the explosion.
Subsequently, different oil companies submitted applications for new drilling attempts.
Obama and Salazar want to rule out a new catastrophe by employing tougher controls and tighter security regulations.
Currently, the responsible supervisory authority, which after being accused of corruption has fallen into disrepute, is reforming at the root.
In parallel, Obama announces that the lucrative tax loopholes for oil and gas consortiums will be closed.
The industry publicly announces that total extraction in the Gulf will be lower thanks to stricter regulation, to date.
“The government’s plans are the biggest drag on the growth of the oil and gas industries,” says the result of the current survey conducted by advisory firm BDO — ahead of Wednesday’s extraction ban.
American Energey Alliance complains about the insecurity in the sector: "No one knows what exactly changes with regulation."
Investments in new extraction projects are prolonged for the time being, to the detriment of growth.
Ogoniland is ruined
River water is brown oil, it smells like a gas station: Millions of gallons of oil spilled have shattered nature in Nigeria’s Ogoniland.
People live off theft, corruption and the illegal oil trade.
Celestine Akpobari is fine with that.
"Don't get tired," the environmental activist reassures journalists: "Today enough oil will pass before your eyes."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has managed to photograph boys wading in the water to the chest with the brightness of the lights reflected in turbulence on the surface: With the colorful glow of the water, the scene looks almost beautiful.
It is not seen that on the surface float brown spots of oil.
Before here I used to pick prawns in handfuls, explains Esther Badom on the bank of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the flowing waters are totally dead.
Five years ago an impressive amount of oil was poured into the formidable wetland by a broken pipe.
The fish around the small town of Bodo had to swim six hours to reach waters full of fish: that, in the heart of the Niger Delta and located in Ogoniland, is considered as one of the most stench-ridden regions in the world.
In the path of the river that passes through mangroves, the extensive desolation is obvious.
Instead of clear water, the boat's engine stirs a brown broth, which dips its hand into the water, will draw some full of oil.
The roots of the mangrove trees rise from the ground like dark licorice sticks, sadly isolating the colliding palms and hanging their palms.
In vain flocks of birds are sought, as if they were in the wetland as always: As soon as the outer barrier is silenced, a kind of ghostly calm of a former paradise with the smell of a petrol station expands in it.
"What is happening here is an ecological struggle," says Celestine Akpobari, "we live in constant danger to health."
A warlike comparison is made.
The Ogoni settlement area has been a battleground for years: Here the first European explorers broke in more than 60 years ago, here the first resistance was organized in the 80s with the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, later executed, here he had to place his first factory the Shell consortium in 1993, because it would be too dangerous for oil employees.
Even today it is forbidden for companies to return to Ogoniland: While more than two million barrels of black gold were pumped daily from the entire delta region, three times the size of Switzerland, with more than 5,000 extraction sources and 7,000 kilometers of pipelines, the oil fields in Ogoniland were quiet, the location is too unstable for the consortium.
Every two hundred meters steel platforms protruded like quirky water sculptures: "Christmas trees" affectionately called the heads of the drills.
They are up to 50 years old, most have a total corrosion.
At every instant a head fails, Akpobari says, so a steady stream of oil flows into the water.
According to the assessments of experts, more than two billion liters have been poured into the delta ecosystem in 50 years: Year after year, the amount of oil penetrates, as in the breakdown of the ship "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago in the Alaskan Sea, one of the largest ecological catastrophes in the history of humanity.
Whoever is responsible for the long-lasting environmental region will deal with it.
While Shell’s consortium and organized oil thefts are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see the heads about to break and leaky pipes as the main causes.
In Nigeria, Shell applies mainly low safety standards normally in the conventional world, reproached the scientist Richard Steiner to the consortium in 2008: Only the indices of defects of the pipes are "over a greater multiple than elsewhere".
In a place, which from a distance seems forgotten, appears a workshop full of oil under the free sky, figures emerge from among the mangroves: They are naked and covered with oil.
Among one of the many barrels, which are sometimes attached to the boreholes, sometimes scattered arbitrarily on the ground, flames a fire: a small illegal refinery.
In the barrel, the oil heats up over the fire for more hours, explains Michael, the group’s head.
First, the gasoline penetrates through the pipes into the vessel, later the oil pipe drips and finally diesel comes out.
In this way, Michael and four employees produce daily up to four barrels of diesel of 300 liters: "It gives us 34,000 naira", about 22 dollars.
The delta’s inhabitants are taking advantage of fuel shortages in one of black Africa’s largest oil states.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
With the absurd and cheap diesel price of just 40 euros-cents per liter, illegal heaters can offer even less: This is how they reduce the value of their raw material.
It comes from “the bunkers”, which rigged the pipeline network that crosses Ogoniland: According to experts, at this step at least 16 million liters of oil are lost a day throughout the Niger Delta.
Only an insignificant part of the provisional raw material stored is clearly illegally refined: Organized criminal networks, to which politicians and senior military officials also belong, keep the best part in cisterns and sell it cheaply on the world market.
Activist Akpobari considers the debate on whether the environmental catastrophe is due to population management or the loose mode of production to be purely academic.
“If the oil companies did not behave like invaders and had not completely destroyed the natural habitat of the fish, there would be no sabotage, no theft, no illegal refineries.”
While the conditions of the Ogoni are shattered above all by Shell to the point that only a deduction of the consortium appears: "Perhaps it is better to present another nationality, like the Chinese."
Michael gets nervous.
“It’s about time you disappeared,” says the muscular <0xC3><0x96>lmann.
"Soldiers can come any minute."
If the special army unit catches the illegal refiners, it does not threaten to arrest them, but with a painful bribe.
The soldiers from the north also want, like all Nigerians, to take advantage of the raw material.
“This doomed invention has completely torn our country to pieces,” Akpobari says.
Researchers detect dangerous factory defects in A380 engines
Apparently, the A380 has a big safety problem.
In an investigation of a machine that made a forced landing, the researchers found a possible factory defect, which can produce "a catastrophic failure in the engine."
Qantas wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
Passengers on the Qantas Airbus that made an emergency landing in early November were much more fortunate than you might imagine: Australian aviation safety authorities perceived a major safety problem with the engines of some A380s thanks to their investigations, and warn of a possible factory defect.
The potential defect has complicated repercussions: In a sleeve connection, fatigue cracks or cracks can be caused, ATSB officials announced in a report published Thursday.
This could have caused “a catastrophic engine failure.”
This affected engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce belonging to 20 aircraft of the A380 series.
Among them is the Qantas-Airbus that had to make a forced landing on November 4 in Singapore.
The Australian airline initiates legal proceedings against the British turbine manufacturer.
He filed a lawsuit in federal court in Sydney that made it possible to take further legal action against the company.
Alan Joyce, head of Qantas, said his airline will seek compensation for the incident in early November.
In the engine mark have lost parts and its wing is deteriorated.
Rolls Royce distinguishes the type of gasoline as the cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines from around the world have to be replaced.
The Australian researchers announced that they will carry out more safety tests on superjumbos equipped with the affected engines.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls Royce, ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan said.
The security issue has become important enough to inform everyone affected.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas aircraft, the airline kept its A380 fleet ashore for many weeks.
Singapore Airlines held approximately three of its eleven A380s temporarily ashore.
Lufthansa refitted the engine of an A380 as a precautionary measure.
This double deck aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
A Nevada Across the Country Causes Traffic Chaos
Totally white Germany: From one day to the next it has snowed almost all over the country.
In many streets chaos reigns, trains and planes fail.
At least three people have lost their lives in traffic accidents.
Winter freezes Germany: Nearly all of the country reached freezing temperatures on Thursday night, triggering traffic chaos at many points.
In some parts of the north and east, there is a layer of snow 15 centimeters thick.
Traffic is very limited on most highways and on many streets.
On the A7 at Flensburg, the snowplows are in continuous operation, removing the new snow again and again, but it is not ready.
In addition, strong gusts of wind sweep the Baltic Sea coast.
The German Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency (BSH) expects high tides with the water level 1.2 meters above its usual level on the Baltic Sea coast Schleswig-Holsteins.
In Saxony, snow accumulation caused considerable problems on motorways and national roads.
According to the meteorological service Meteomedia, the red alert is called in S<0xC3><0xA4>chsischen Schweiz, actually the highest alert.
There is partially 30 centimeters of freshly fallen snow and cold and strong winds are responsible for swirling it.
Many trucks and cars were trapped there during the night.
Also in Saxony Anhalt, police authorities reported major street disturbances.
On the A2, snow and wind paralyzed traffic and created traffic jams.
In Thuringia, snowfall affected the A4 and A9.
According to Deutscher Bahn, major disturbances are expected in Saxony, Saxony Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
Snow on the road, fallen trees on the rails or broken catenary and holes are the main problems.
In Saxony, intercity service from Leipzig to Nuremberg is suspended.
In Saafeld, Thuringia an ICE train had to stop its journey to Munich.
Firefighters and the rescue service attended to the 165 passengers on the train with blankets of wool, food and drink.
Snowy winds sweep the streets.
At the largest German airport, snowy winds caused numerous flight suspensions.
According to a spokeswoman for the flight information centre, some cancellations have already been announced in Munich.
In Frankfurt am Main, according to a Fraport spokeswoman, 40 flights have already been cancelled.
The snowplows are in continuous operation.
However, there are few passengers stranded at the airport, despite that there are 400 field beds prepared for them.
In many streets, on Wednesday afternoon there were already many accidents.
In the afternoon a trucker was killed in a collision with a train at a railway junction in Ostholstein.
The driver suffered minor injuries.
In the vicinity of Nuremberg there was a similar accident because of the snowy streets: Also here a truck was hit at a crossroads because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver lost his life.
In the train four passengers were injured, the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was blocked for this reason in the morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after overturning her car near Aschaffenburg on a slippery road.
Meteorologists have good news: Snow will become softer and dust-like and will therefore swirl in gentle gusts.
But the wind will decrease.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by strong and fast winds.
It will certainly continue to be very cold, in some places up to 15 degrees negative.
Deusche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to break away from its symbol: According to an article, the financial institution is looking for a buyer for its office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
The property could contribute up to 500 million euros.
Deutschen Bank recently set up its headquarters: The twin towers in Frankfurt’s banking district were modernized; while the bankers returned to their old workplace.
But now the financial consortium apparently wants to take advantage of the costs of the renovation, and is looking for a buyer for the two skyscrapers, as the "Financial Times Deutschland" claims based on a spokesman.
The spokesman does not name the reasons for the proposed sale.
"We always check whether it is convenient to own the properties or sell them and then re-rent them," he said.
That’s why Germany’s largest credit institution is renouncing its corporate headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank acquired the twin towers in mid-2007 for 272 million euros from the investor of a house fund and then made the relevant arrangements.
The energy reforms reached figures of approximately 200 million euros.
A sale would mean a lot of money for the bank.
Experts in this field calculate the value of the towers of the newspaper renamed "Greentowers" at around 500 million euros.
Whether the renovated buildings are sold in a bank fund or to an independent investor has not yet been revealed, the spokesman said.
Thousands mourn for the dead miners
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people thought of the buried miners, who were presumed dead after many explosions at a mine.
The bodies have not yet been found, because the security measures remain precarious in the place of misfortune.
Almost two weeks ago there was an intense explosion at the Pike River mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were buried in the mine.
A probe was inserted at the site of the mishap, but found no sign of survival.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and successive explosions, no life-saving equipment could be brought down for safety reasons.
After the second intense detonation, authorities and experts deduced that there was no chance that the miners had survived.
The bodies have not been recovered to date.
Today, family and friends remember the deceased with a memorial service.
Ten thousand people have changed with the resplendent glow of the sun at Greymouth on New Zealand’s South Island.
They remain silent for two minutes.
In honor of the buried miners, 29 tables were placed with the miners’ helmets, lamps and names.
There were also photographs and personal items, underneath clothing and surfboards.
The flags flew at half-mast in front of the country's government buildings.
New Zealand waited for miners to return to the surface “from the depths of the earth,” John Key, the president of the New Zealand government, told participants in the commemorative event.
"But they never came home."
He cannot assume the death of his son until he has seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the mine.
Along with the president of the government and the families of the victims, many foreign diplomats participated in the commemorative ceremony.
The first blast on 19 November also buried British and South African miners.
Rescue workers started by extinguishing a fire inside the coal mine on the South Island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases have been extracted, the scorching temperatures inside the mine will begin to drop, Gary Knowles, the police superior, told reporters.
To hell with you, warrior!
Does gore fit into arthouse filmmaking?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn re-explores the genre’s frontiers with his epic “Walhalla Rising” battles.
What audience did Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think of when shooting "Walhalla Rising"?
A one-eyed Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his tormentors and murders his enemies with almost superhuman fights, sounds ideal for young bystanders seeking bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to employ brutal methods to kill and rip his enemies’ guts out of their bodies alive when he’s in a bad mood.
On the other hand, Unojo, as he is actually called, says almost no words throughout the film and the other characters get carried away by at most one or two sentences or a couple of painful death screams.
Otherwise they shut up and enjoy the beautiful and terrifying mountainous landscapes of Scotland, which the backstage offers to the Viking world from about a thousand years ago.
Rather ideal for grown-up filmmakers interested in existentialism and very calm camera movements.
When a film has multiple target groups it is a shame that they cannot be mutually discarded.
Director Winding Refn considers his savages and the "Pusher" drug-dealing hairstyle trilogy a sort of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but he stoically refuses to make his works public with a little more mainstream humor or a little less artistic house brutality.
A bulging brain mass and guts can’t dissuade most fans of arthouse cinema.
Most fans of the action die of boredom, if Unojo takes a boat to Jerusalem with a troop of violent Christian missionaries for interpretable reasons and gets stuck for an eternity in the calm and fog before his team arrives in America and falls silent again there.
It is a pity that "Walhalla Rising" has not found a film distributor in Germany and is only released on DVD.
It is a calamity against magnificent images, but also because, behind the presumptuous and bloody facade, hides a piece of sometimes exciting cinema, which deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogue or logical action, everything is atmosphere, a fever dream transformed into film.
There is no escape for the spectators.
Refn is just a moment of relaxation and his glacial images and the gloomy soundtrack of trance make a knot in his throat, above all, the incredible hatred, which from the hearts of the characters goes towards him.
Only a young blond boy, who supports Unojo faithfully, retains something like innocence, everyone else is possessed by anger.
Above all, the one-eyed hero, whose motives are never explained, becomes at any time a warrior out of hell for enemies and provisional allies, possibly the ambassador of the same devil.
He represents perdition, but perhaps only for those who are lost anyway.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that you can hate and admire, to get angry, upset and surprised.
An experience.
Mysterious earth movements
The IAEA nuclear power organization has new indications of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
The country refuses to comment on this issue until controls are allowed.
On the midnight of September 5-6, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15I fighter jets attacked a mysterious cubic building in Syria.
It is located on the bank of the Euphrates; the nearest and largest city, 30 kilometers is Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), it is about a reactor that apparently the Syrians built with the help of North Korea in the bucket, hidden in a valley that comes out of the river.
According to information from the U.S. international intelligence service of the CIA at the end of April 2008, a current reactor was designed under the name of the vicinity of el-Kibar very appropriate for the production of plutonium, with which nuclear weapons are built.
On the other hand, the technique hardly serves other purposes than those of the fifties.
The CIA showed a video presentation with blurred satellite images.
They showed with a computer animation where the components of the reactor were before the destruction, which was a reduced copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
They also showed photographs showing the building from nearby or from the inside.
The reactor had only recently been in operation, he says, but was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, three years after the bombing, it is hardly better known than back then, the puzzles grew bigger over time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that before the attack the CIA was absolutely certain that the Syrians had built a reactor in El-Kibar, but that it saw little indication that there was a “nuclear weapons program” in the country.
In Europe, several secret service agents prefer to be even more cautious and only talk about an “alleged reactor”, although they consider the CIA’s presentation “plausible”.
They lack solid evidence, as does the IAEA.
When asked how safe it was to have a reactor in front of them, a senior UN diplomat replied in the summer that the IAEA had “enough material to ask questions.”
The Syrians very quickly disposed of the rubble of the alleged "unused military building" and cleared the ground thoroughly.
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team under former chief inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of uranium in el-Kibar, which had been manufactured by people.
In addition, the IAEA obtained satellite images of a member state from commercial vendors in the moments immediately after the attack, which must have a higher information value than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photographs did not reach the market because an unknown customer, perhaps Israel, bought them exclusively.
That is why the IAEA cannot independently verify its authenticity.
Syria always implied that it had never had a secret nuclear program or built any reactors.
The uranium came from Israeli weapons, Damaskus explained.
The IAEA rejected it as implausible after particle analyses.
Since then, Damaskus has refused to discuss the matter, as he does the satellite imagery.
In addition, controllers are barred from a second inspection in el-Kibar and entry to the ruins of the bombed-out building.
Israel also keeps a strict silence.
“We will never comment,” Ehud Olmert, the acting prime minister at the time of the attack, recently confirmed the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case has not yielded results since June 2008 and “is progressively becoming a serious credibility problem for the authorities”, as a senior Western diplomat corresponds with a place at the IAEA in Vienna, finally a serious violation of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, which the IAEA watches over, is pending.
The IAEA considers three more teams as the key to progress in the clarification, which must be "in functional connection" with the alleged reactor, and others like these still exist.
Inspectors have so far not made public what equipment they are treating, what functions they have, or whether they appear suspicious.
According to the newspaper S<0xC3><0xBC>ddeutschen Zeitung, the IAEA has designated Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah as internees, again derived from the vicinity of the situated cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (ISIS) identified these locations and located a complex of buildings near Masyaf with satellite imagery, which is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
Possibly located on or immediately next to a military base, Syria prohibits entry to the three sites to the IAEA.
In Vienna it is said that Syrians fear a registration that the US has requested from the IAEA to spy on military plants.
Nuclear detectives were alerted about the equipment thanks to warnings from the U.S. Secret Service.
Through satellite photographs, the IAEA has indications that material is being moved between the three sites and the bucket on the banks of the Euphrates.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said at least one of the teams may be "related to fuel production".
But there is "no indication of sensitive activities", neither of uranium enrichment nor reconditioning; processes that are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is operated with uranium that is not enriched.
Where uranium should come from and where plutonium should subsequently be separated for bombs, for these central questions there are, at best, plausible assumptions.
There is also no doubt that the ruins, the valuable clues that can be recovered, are in all three places.
As hundreds of truck loads disappeared from the ground, no one has information about where the debris remains.
The OIAE considers the al-Tibni salt mine, located in the few kilometers from el-Kibar to the other part of the Euphrates, which the Syrians recognized in 1998 for its suitability as an area for radioactive waste, unlikely.
Recently, Robert Kelly, the former IAEA inspector, linked it to the reactor in an analysis of satellite imagery for the prestigious Jane’s Intelligence Review.
But photographs from orbit show that the Syrians made earthworks at the three suspected locations and removed large containers after the IAEA requested entry.
It may be a coincidence, but it hardly helps to dispel suspicion.
In addition, in the diplomatic sector it is said that the IAEA has spent some months to develop a plan of inspections there, which the Syrians would allow, to maintain the possible military secrecy, only the deployment shows the magnitude of the interest of the inspectors.
In the meantime, Damaskus also criticizes this proposal.
Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago were reassured that the reactor was already destroyed, so the matter is not very urgent, for a couple of months now, Glyn Davies, a type of US ambassador wields the so-called exceptional inspections, one of the most rigorous means that the Viennese nuclear authorities have to establish controls.
Yukiya Amano, the director of the IAEA, who is to propose these inspections, has spoken of "an option to which I am open in the future", but still hesitates.
This path is very risky: the majority of the IAEA governing council is needed for this, and some of the 35 countries represented there are not exactly eager for an escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat reflected, “And what if they don’t find anything in the end?”
Love in the Time of War
There have been problems since Angelina Jolie began directing her as-yet-unnamed debut in the summer.
She has written the script herself, a love story between a Bosnian and a Serb.
Not much more is known about it, but this is enough for agitation.
The rumor is very persistent, the woman, Muslim, falls in love with her Serbian rapist during the war in Yugoslavia.
The Bosnian women's associations quickly protested, and at the last moment they moved some planned filming days from Sarajevo to Hungary.
The film has been shot in Hungary and in post-production, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the women's war victims' organization wrote to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, for Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, reported a Bosnian newspaper, Jolie is the ambassador of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
She is not diplomatic, weeks ago the women offered her a meeting in Hungary that she refused.
The meeting took place in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
No love stories are given in the rape camps, and Jolie's position on the matter gives the victims enough on the script.
Her organization in agreement with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees has recommended dismissing Jolie as ambassador.
But what exactly did Jolie write for the scenes?
The Bosnian culture ministry that read the script, which issued a recording permit in Sarajevo after a back-and-forth, isn’t entirely clear why Jolie didn’t go anyway.
The young author reiterates that she does not pursue political purposes with her film, she introduces herself with much effort in the Yugoslav conflict, she wants to show the horrible consequences of the war and give voice to all the parties involved.
Its content remains imprecise.
The lovers were together before the start of the war and meet again when she, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
What sounds considerably different is the “rape victim falls in love with torturer” variant.
It is certain that Jolie’s film really begins before the war.
The pressure on her, Jolie says, is “unfair and based on misinformation.”
They can currently make peace with the Hollywood hackers: While the script is still on the net illegally, like many others before.
Nothing like far from here
This afternoon is finally good for the Irish again.
No trace of distress
Instead, the home team dominates over its customers from Sweden, Finland and the US.
Fans shout with joy as loud music rumbles, hitting the ground with their feet.
The Bailey club vibrates in Cork, because the players throw themselves, and find, pingpong balls to the beer glasses from a distance of three meters.
The strange show is called "Beerpong", and the prize for the winner is 500 euros plus a few plane tickets to Las Vegas for the world beerpong championship in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy, this quirky drinking game and the unobtrusive computer don't really make good crumbs.
And the 26-year-old boy tries to have fun with that, distract himself from the fulminating question, what the future will bring.
The fun in Las Vegas is not in his plans, in January he will conduct a personal interview in New Zealand.
“I have a bad feeling,” he says.
“It’s a long way from home and I don’t have a job there yet.”
At the very least: His girlfriend is waiting for him in Auckland, “he suddenly got the job of his dreams as an event manager, maybe it’s a good sign,” says the young man and smiles.
Because of bad prospects at home, two of Tanners’ three brothers have already sought luck abroad.
Her sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, her brother Colin currently works as an IT consultant in London.
On the island there are many families like the Tanners.
100,000 Irish will leave the country in the near future, forecast economic experts and the ESRI social research institute in Dublin.
Up to 2015 there are 200,000 emigrants.
A great loss for this small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants.
The forecasts are confirmed, there comes a migratory wave comparable to the one that the island suffered in the eighties.
After a decade of progression that brought great well-being to the Irish, melancholy now spreads.
The economic crisis confuses especially the young, well-educated Irish, for whom so far, everything is uphill.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone needs money in abundance.
But three out of ten men and women under the age of 30 are unemployed.
In the Irish Times there are letters to the director en masse of young emigrants, who complain that: "In Ireland everything sinks."
“There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but who can, goes and loses our country and with it an entire generation.”
"The last one to close the door."
Leanne Caulfield, a law student and president of the Irish Students’ Union, sees a bleak future because the government is all about set-ups and no longer offers prospects for young people.
“They cut minimum wages, but they don’t have strategies for getting new jobs,” the 20-year-old says.
Observe how his colleagues go from a few practices not summarized to the following ones.
His biggest concern, he explains, is having to emigrate in four years.
“This idea is sad and depressing.”
People like Stephen McLarnon try to look at this issue in a positive way.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a fair that offers a service around the theme of working abroad.
"For those who start working, doing it abroad is an excellent opportunity, the first steps to direct your career," says the manager.
The website features photos of a boy surfing in Australia and another snowboarding in Canada.
The message is clear: working abroad is not like doing it in the galleys, but it involves freedom and fun.
For half a year, Seán O'Donovan has known what it's like to build something somewhere else.
Since there was nothing left to do for the 29-year-old engineer, he currently works with 15 Irish colleagues in construction in Germany.
They are now building a fashion shop in Gelsenkirchen.
In January he goes to Hannover or Berlin, to the next project.
O'Donovan sees his homeland only a few times because he works overtime to be able to pay off a loan for his home in Ireland.
“The situation is a little crazy,” he says, since it’s been a long time since he first stepped on the threshold of his house.
"I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland, where I'm never so good."
He laughs a little embarrassed and leaves for icy rooms.
The small house is in an elegant residential area with manicured gardens in front of the houses, at the entrance are parked large and expensive cars.
O'Donovan bought the house with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros, 100 percent financed by a loan.
“It was crazy times, there was easy money without a lot of questions,” he says.
Are you afraid of failing on credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, serves more hot tea and says, "I don't have kids to feed and I'm young; if everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch."
The civil engineer does not like the complaints he often hears nowadays.
“No one should go hungry, our situation is by far not as dramatic as in times past here on the island,” he says.
"Working a season abroad is not the worst thing that can happen, maybe with it we feel like Irish for the first time."
He laughs and tells about his father, who in the last great economic crisis went to England.
"After seven years he came back and life went on in Ireland, very simple."
Cian Tanner likes these ideas.
Leave the future hanging and just see what life is like elsewhere.
He’s already worked a couple of years in London, so why wouldn’t he and his girlfriend do well in New Zealand?
But these days there is one thing that worries him greatly: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He's afraid it could degenerate into a farewell party.
“Just, not too many emotions,” he says and gives a big drink to his beer.
"Goodbye, sounds very distressing."
“We better call it a marching party, very relaxed, with a couple of friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of games.”
The Democratic Routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to grow, as does support for private companies.
Crime is more of a concern than unemployment.
In addition, in much of the region, Brazil is seen as a more influential country than the United States.
These are some of the findings of the latest Latinobarometer survey conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
As the survey has been conducted on a regular basis since 1995, it makes it possible to monitor changes in attitudes in the region.
The results of this year’s survey, conducted in September and early October, highlight two related issues.
The first is the relatively lively humor that reigns in Latin America.
The second is the increasing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased considerably in a number of countries along the Pacific coast of South America (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6 per cent per year since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a reduced 40 per cent in 2005 to 61 per cent this year.
It also grew in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after suffering a large decline in production last year.
However, only half of the respondents from Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the region, are convinced Democrats, which lowers the regional average (see Figure 2).
About 44 per cent of respondents in the region said they were satisfied with the way democracy works in practice in their country, the same as last year, but considerably higher than the 25 per cent recorded in 2001 (figure 3).
About 34 per cent said they trusted their country ' s Congress and 45 per cent their government, the same as last year in both cases, but considerably higher than in 2003 (17 per cent and 24 per cent, respectively).
A decade ago, economic turmoil in Latin America severely affected support for democracy.
The fact that it has held up during the global financial crisis is likely due to the fact that many Latin American countries were only affected by a brief recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, the existence of a stronger social safety net has helped to protect the poorest.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty increased only marginally in 2009 and has fallen again this year, to 32 per cent.)
However, mood varies considerably from country to country (see Figure 4).
Brazil’s good economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, is reflected in a general sense of progress.
This sentiment is less common in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more severe and violent crime has increased.
For the second time since the surveys began, more respondents in Latin America cite crime, rather than unemployment, as the most serious problem facing their country (see Figure 5).
About 31 per cent say they or a close relative have been a victim of crime in the past year, down from 38 per cent last year and the lowest percentage since 1995.
The more positive economic returns are reflected in greater support for private enterprises and the market economy: around 71 per cent of respondents in the region say that private enterprises are indispensable for development, compared to only 56 per cent in 2007 (see figure 6).
About 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow their country to develop, up from 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela feel the same way (and 80% support private companies), although its leftist president, Hugo Chávez, is expropriating numerous private companies.
Brazil is the country with the highest leadership in the region, as indicated by 19% of respondents (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, the same figure as last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% a year ago).
However, the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, while Venezuela holds such a title in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Elections in the trash
No one expected the November 28 general election in Haiti to be perfect.
But it was far worse than feared by foreigners trying to help the country recover from its troubles.
Votes were introduced at the polls, some people voted several times, ballots were thrown in the sewers, polling stations were destroyed and acts of intimidation were carried out.
The polling stations opened hours late.
Numerous Haitians, including groups displaced by the January earthquake, were wandering the area trying to figure out where they had to vote.
Some of them, in the end, gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several of the most popular, denounced fraud and called for the annulment of the elections.
The protests, some of them violent, spread across the country.
But Edmond Mulet, the highest-ranking United Nations official in Haiti, said they were "relatively good choices in many ways."
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community cautioned that "we do not believe that these irregularities, however serious, necessarily invalidate the process."
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, which its opponents say is committed to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, should announce the preliminary results on Dec. 7.
The tiebreaker is expected to take place in January.
All hopes for the elections have not yet been lost.
The two main opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rapper, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, have withdrawn their initial petition calling for the invalidation of the vote.
But problems can still arise if the electoral authority declares that Mr. Célestin, who has hardly any support, if any, has moved on to the second round.
Given that the cholera epidemic is sweeping the country and more than a million earthquake survivors are still living in tents, a large abstention is expected.
When the time came, many Haitians wanted to vote, but failed to do so due to a lack of organization.
About 250,000 identity documents needed to vote had not yet been distributed shortly before the elections.
There's a lot at stake.
Aid donors see the election of a popular and legitimate government as an essential step in Haiti’s reconstruction.
And, as it has become clear, so do Haitians themselves.
Advancing tiptoe to the center
In the weeks since she lost her husband, Cristina Fernandez, the president of Argentina, has enjoyed great public sympathy that has increased her popularity rate by 20 points, to more than 50%, the highest level she has recorded since her election in 2007.
Still, whether she can turn it into a successful campaign for a second term in next year’s election will depend on whether the clearly affected Ms. Fernandez puts aside the intransigence of her late husband, her predecessor and political partner, Nestor Kirchner.
And, at this point, the indications are inconclusive.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to take charge of economic policy even after his wife succeeded him as president, was in the habit of crafting budgets that undervalued tax revenues, economic growth, and inflation.
This allowed the presidential marriage to spend the additional income at its discretion.
In theory, Ms. Fernandez’s government lost its majority in Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided, a situation that has worsened after Kirchner's death from a heart attack on October 27.
Some dissenting members of the Peronist movement in power have clashed with Ms. Fernández.
However, after chaotic sessions in which one MP punched another in the face and other MPs accused the government of bribery, Congress decided to reject the 2011 budget.
“I’m not going to argue,” the president said.
The 2010 budget will therefore apply to next year, giving the President even more scope to spend it.
The economy is improving considerably: it will probably grow by as much as 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently at 11.1%, but numerous private calculations, in addition to the wage demands of the unions, place it near 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took power in 2003 when Argentina was on the brink of economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction his priorities, rather than controlling inflation.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, put pressure on the private sector and had INDEC, the statistical institute, adapt official inflation statistics.
Will President Fernandez moderate these policies now?
It has convened meetings between the private sector and trade union leaders.
In addition, its officials say they want to limit wage increases next year to 18 percent.
The economy has been boosted by the high prices of Argentine agricultural exports in the world.
However, inflation has limited the growth boost achieved with a large devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps for this reason, Mrs. Fernández is showing signs of wanting to restore Argentina’s financial ties with the rest of the world.
At the beginning of the year, the government reached an agreement with bondholders who had refused a previous forced restructuring of the debt that Argentina had not paid in 2001.
Currently, it seems that Mrs. Fernández is about to conclude an agreement with the creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which she owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners always insisted that this would not involve IMF supervision, as is usually the case.
However, last month Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund will offer “technical assistance” to develop a new national consumer price index, which seems the prelude to the cleaning up of the INDEC.
It is unclear whether President Fernandez wants to stay in politics after her term ends, given that she no longer has her husband by her side.
If it does, it will need to win the support of the middle class, much of which has grown tired of Kirchnerism.
When Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have waned.
If she wants to win another election, she’ll have to decide whether or not to quietly repudiate many of her husband’s policies.
Half a hurrah for China
Taiwan’s voters are slowly approaching a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think about its big brother across the strait?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70 percent of those eligible, turned out on Nov. 27 to elect mayors and councilors from five urban districts in what appears to be a broad assessment by President Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself has become an advocate of sentiments for the continent, forging innovative business ties, including a partial free trade pact, the biggest change in relations with China since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but barely.
Although his Kuomintang (KMT) party ended up winning three of the five mayoral elections, it failed to win a majority of the votes.
Instead, the Progressive Democratic Party (PPD), which has been leaning toward full independence from Taiwan, won virtually 50 percent of all votes versus 45 percent from the KMT.
If it had been the presidential election, Mr. Ma would be in trouble.
Since his election two years ago, his party’s share of the vote has declined by about 8%.
For the first time, the PPD tied with the KMT in town halls.
In the elections, typical elements of the Taiwanese elections were seen, including noisy campaign trucks and large crowds with flags and light girls in dancing clothes.
There was also no lack of the mysterious attempt on his life.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan, honorary president of the KMT, was campaigning for one of the KMT candidates the night before the elections.
A man from the crowd shot the young man directly in the face, wounding him and killing a bystander.
The curious thing is that it has not been possible to determine whether the man intended to harm Lien or take revenge on the candidate.
In any case, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PPD, the shooting affected the elections, sowing suspicion about the PPD and causing voters to lean towards the KMT.
Perhaps the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was surprising that it was not the issue of the continent itself.
Instead, the candidates talked about public housing plans and job creation.
Taiwan normally enjoys its de facto independence and detests China's military threat.
Consequently, the KMT often avoids publicizing its links with the government in Beijing.
But this time also the PPD avoided encouraging anti-China sentiment.
It responds to the new awareness that Chinese trade is essential to Taiwan’s economic survival.
For his part, Mr. Ma stated that his policy towards China had been confirmed to be acceptable to most Taiwanese.
The Beijing government is expected to continue bribing them with trade, in line with its strategy to get Taiwan back on the fold.
China wasted no time sending a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
He would certainly like to achieve political integration as well, but the first thing is the first thing.
It will be best to wait until the 2012 presidential election for this.
In any case, the PPD has been reinvented.
Two years ago it was in a bad situation: its former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was jailed on corruption charges.
President between 2000 and 2008, openly instigated explicit independence.
However, under Ms. Tsai’s leadership, a new generation of moderates has emerged and the PPD is striving to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai has been welcomed as a PPD candidate for the presidency, as has Su Tseng-chang, who served under Chen.
Now his party is doing its best to show that it can also have relations with Beijing.
Ms Tsai announced plans to set up an expert group to act as a contact point between the DPP and China, provided that negotiations can take place without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party represents a “reliable alternative” to Mr. Ma’s hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems furious about the change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he said PPD candidates would have fared better if they had insisted that Taiwan is an independent country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to run for president.
Even without Mr. Chen’s intercession, the PPD will have a hard time choosing between its possible candidates.
The KMT must also make an examination of conscience.
Mr Ma’s assessments have been poor, despite impressive economic growth; the KMT candidates have not wanted to campaign with him.
Its lack of popularity seems to be mainly due to unemployment and the growing differences between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesman says he will restructure his cabinet as well as local teams.
The PPD’s large samples suggest that Taiwan’s support for a rapprochement is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a well-known columnist, "the point of no return has already been crossed."
Grammy Nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is the surprise choice in the Breakthrough Artist category.
Act at the request of a president and possibly people will notice you.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old bassist and jazz singer personally selected by President Obama to perform at his Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in 2009, was one of the surprises of the Grammys this year with a high-level nomination in the category of Best New Artist.
Given that Spalding has been an acclaimed jazz figure since his 2008 album, "Esperanza," the nomination is sobering, but it respects Grammy rules that an artist must be who has not released more than three albums before recording the one that "determines the public identity of that artist."
His ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", was certainly a breakthrough and, given his light and pleasant vocal style, as well as a great ability with pop, funk and Latin rhythms influences, one can at least draw a distinction between Spalding and the path to success of Norah Jones in 2003, the closest equivalent for Grammy voters, who have lately focused on the jazz arena for this category.
In the remaining categories, Grammy voters rightly honored Vijay Iyer Trio’s “Historicity,” an exciting and magnificent record that was a favorite last year.
Among Iyer's competitors are veteran saxophonist James Moody with "Moody 4B" and keyboardist John Beasley for "Positootly."
Trombone Shorty, a raucous favorite in New Orleans and a regular guest on HBO's "Treme," was honored in the contemporary jazz category, which otherwise leans considerably toward fusion as on the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Darcy's wild punk James Argue's Secret Society earned a well-deserved accolade in the big band category, competing against the great chamber jazz of the Billy Childs Ensemble and the ever-risky Dave Holland, whose live album with his octet, "Pathways", was a great example of the bassist's democratic leadership in his band.
Grammy Award Nominations: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey for Best Classical Album Direction
Nominations in the field of classical music for the 53rd Grammy Awards include a mix of musicians and composers from around the world.
The main nominations were for Michael Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina", for piano and orchestra, five movements, and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", a work for three-movement eclectic orchestra.
Nominees with ties to Southern California include Estonian composer Arvo P<0xC3><0xA4>rt for his Symphony No. 4, “Los Angeles,” a piece commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
Los Angeles-based composer Avner Dorman is also nominated for his Mandolin Concerto.
Classical music nominations are distributed in thirteen categories spanning orchestral, opera, choral and solo albums.
The classic producer of the year category includes five nominees: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin, and James Mallinson.
The nominees for the classical music album are Bruckner for Symphonies No. 3 and No. 4 of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey for "Dreamhouse" of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; and "Sacrificium" by the Art of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra.
In the opera category, the nominees are Berg for "Lulu" by the Royal Opera House Orchestra; Adolf Hasse for "Marc Antonio and Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho for "L'Amour de Loin" by the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" by the BBC and the orchestra's "Inched Marinder".
Composers nominated for a Grammy for contemporary compositions include P<0xC3><0xA4>rt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Passionately Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer".
P<0xC3><0xA4>rt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a session recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The piece, about 30 minutes long, is nicknamed "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" is nominated for instrumental solo performance with orchestra.
The Los Angeles songwriter wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for Avi Avital, who performed the concerto with the New York-based Metropolis Ensemble.
"He composed it with Middle Eastern sounds and numerous North African scales and rhythms," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Director Pierre Boulez, 85, was nominated in the orchestral performance category for conducting the Chicago Symphony Orchestra during a recording of Stravinsky’s works.
Nominated instrumental soloists include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
The nominees as vocal soloists are all women this year: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic mix category, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording of "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The proposed mosque in Temecula gets approval from the ordinance commission
The Temecula mosque project has won unanimous support from the local ordinance commission after more than five hours of often heated public testimony.
Critics attacked the project as fomenting terrorism and traffic jams.
However, members of the commission decided Wednesday night that the new religious center respected local legislation and would be aesthetically impressive.
“Many good people came to show their support, both Christians and Jews or Baha’is, of all religions,” Hadi Nael, president of the Temecula Valley Islamic Center, said Thursday morning.
“The truth is, as an American citizen, I’m proud of it.”
“It shows that justice prevails.”
“The opposition is really minimal,” he adds.
“They just talk too loud.”
"There are wonderful people in this valley."
The meeting began at 6 p.m. and lasted practically until midnight; most of the time was devoted to people who interceded for or against the center, practically the same amount on each side, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper’s website.
“America no longer exists,” reads one of the comments.
"This is another Planet of the Apes with Mrs. Liberty dead in the sand."
“America has fallen.”
Plans to build Islamic centers have also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including near ground zero, the New York area where the September 11 attacks took place.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has denounced acts of violence.
His congregation of about 135 families has been living together smoothly in Riverside County for years, but he wanted a bigger and better space than the warehouse he rented on a shared property with a manufacturer of water filtration systems.
The new 24,943-square-foot mosque, with a Mediterranean architectural style, would include two minarets and rise to 43 feet.
It would occupy an area of 4.32 acres on Nicolas Road, about two miles east of the Chaparral Institute.
Opponents can still appeal the project to the City Council.
An arsenic-resistant microbe raises the possibility of new forms of life on Earth... or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacterium that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients expands the possibility of finding new forms of life on Earth and possibly on other planets.
Although the researchers discovered the curious bacterium here on Earth, they say it shows that it is possible that there are life forms without the main elements they considered essential.
"This organism has a dual capacity."
"It can grow either with phosphorus or with arsenic."
"That makes it a very peculiar thing, although it's very close to being a really 'alien' kind of life form," said Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report that appears in Thursday's online edition of the journal Science.
It has long been thought that there are six major elements essential to life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur.
However, researchers have found that the bacteria, found in Mono Lake, California, can continue to grow after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
“It makes you wonder what else is possible,” said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, a co-author of the report.
According to Anbar, the finding is important for the search for life on planets other than Earth, since researchers need to be able to recognize life, to know what it looks like.
The study focuses on a microbe discovered on Earth.
However, the convening of a press conference to discuss it, in which details of the discovery were not disclosed, generated a great deal of speculation on the Internet about the possibility that the report indicated the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
He didn't.
What the discovery "does show is that in other planetary environments, there could be organisms that use other elements to boost their biochemistry and that the set of 'standard' elements that we consider indispensable for life may not be as fixed," said Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, in Milton Keynes, UK.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is novel because it demonstrates the substitution of one element for another in biochemistry and basic biochemical structure," Cockell added.
The discovery was not made by chance.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA’s Institute of Astrobiology, who led the study, focused on Mono Lake because it has elevated arsenic levels.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, so he speculated that a microbe exposed to both could substitute for one another.
“Arsenic is toxic primarily because its chemical behavior is similar to that of phosphorus.”
"Consequently, it can be difficult for organisms to differentiate between them."
“However, arsenic is different enough that it doesn’t work as well as phosphorus, so it comes in and, so to speak, clogs the biochemical machinery,” Anbar explains.
The researchers collected the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed them to increasing concentrations of arsenic, which they managed to adapt to and used to grow.
The microbe grows best on phosphorus, but demonstrating that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that a form of life using arsenic could naturally exist, either in other areas of the Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said the idea that arsenic can be replaced by phosphorus is not new, but an example has never been found to show that it works.
Arsenic was more common in the early Earth ages, he noted, so researchers speculated that early life forms may have used it.
"It does suggest that there might be other means of generating life, not just the way life was formed on Earth in the olden days," said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health.
Stolen dogs found missing in Compton
Two dogs have been found missing from the four stolen in front of the Bellflower motel, Los Angeles County Sheriff’s deputies said Thursday.
The four racing dogs, two Akitas and two Welsh Pembroke Corgis, went missing Tuesday when someone stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express pickup truck they were spending the night in front of Bellflower Motel 6, authorities said.
Two of the canines recovered Wednesday afternoon and the remaining two were found late Wednesday night, according to Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department.
“The good news is that dogs are doing well,” Whitmore said.
“They are in good condition.”
"They have returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore declined to say exactly where the dogs were found, in which neighborhood, or the circumstances of the discovery.
"An investigation is underway."
“We don’t want to say anything,” Whitmore said.
"We're following some leads."
Dog owners Kristina Rickard and David Peek could not be reached for comment Thursday.
They met with their two Akitas at a county animal shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
Sheriff's deputies found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
According to the authorities, the Akitas (Trace, a 3-year-old dog, and Didi, a 10-month-old dog) had not been harmed.
But Bunny and Peter, the Corgis Rickard and Peek intended to display at area competitions this week on behalf of the Japanese owners of the dogs, remained missing until Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in town for the AKC/Eukanuba national championship in Long Beach this weekend and intended to showcase Trace.
The other dogs were to be shown at other competitions planned for the days leading up to the AKC/Eukanuba championship, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops on the couple’s nearly two-month tour of dog shows.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked into the motel.
They usually stay in motels and park the van right in front of their bedroom window.
They brought three other dogs (a boxer calf, a Parson Russell terrier, and a Brittany), who slept with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and Corgis in the van because they have a very thick coat and would be cooler.
They left the windows slightly open so the dogs could breathe fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the van stolen Tuesday at 6 a.m.
Peek had said they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the Corgis, equipped with microchips to identify them.
On Thursday, it was unclear whether a reward would be given or not.
The lion is ready to roar again, as MGM’s restructuring gets final court approval
After 18 months of confusion and uncertainty, MGM has finally got the green light to start over.
On Thursday, a federal bankruptcy judge in New York officially approved the “pre-armed” plan by creditors to erase approximately $5 billion of debt, paving the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to focus its efforts on producing and premiering movies and TV shows.
Thursday’s ruling confirms that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, so there are no other legal hurdles for MGM to relaunch under Spyglass Entertainment founders Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the chief executives of what will be a scaled-down studio.
Staff will be reduced from 400 to approximately 320.
In reality, MGM will not exit Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase closes a planned $500 million credit facility to fund the operations and productions of the new MGM.
The investment bank is currently syndicating the loan, which on its own is contributing $75 million, and is expected to be funded by mid-December.
The studio’s restructuring process began in May 2009, when investment bank Moelis and Co. was hired to advise on the management needed to sort out its finances, as it struggled to make interest payments of $300 million a year.
In August, Principal Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former Enron President and bankruptcy recovery expert, known for his work on Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper’s attempts to resolve MGM’s financial woes and satisfy the studio’s more than 140 creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, in late 2009 the parties agreed to put the company up for sale.
However, the auction attracted few bidders and none willing to pay the more than $2 billion sought by creditors.
Before the spring of this year, he returned to the design table as the MGM team began work on a restructuring plan that, after months of internal debate and disagreements, was finally backed by creditors in late October.
When MGM officially comes out of bankruptcy in the coming weeks, the Moelis and Cooper companies will receive multi-million dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis and Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will get a $9.5 million payment.
Cooper’s companies, which have been raising $375,000 per month for their company management services, will receive a “success fee” of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM, which released only one film this year, and put together an annual slate of seven or eight films to come out in 2012.
They also plan to co-finance two films based on “The Hobbit,” along with Warner Bros.
The studio needs to arrange a separate loan of between $265 million and $275 million to finance its share of those two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 18% of MGM’s debt, had been trying to arrange a studio merger with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent talks between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Tech Toys Wants to Keep Your Gift Budget Balanced
While the iPad is the top contender to be the most wonderful toy this year, followed by, perhaps, the Microsoft Kinect video game system, both can mean a significant dent in your gift budget.
Consider that for the price of an iPad you can buy five BMX bikes for $99 each, and a Kinect game costs the same as 10 classic jump ropes adorned with beads, or about 48 cans of the Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
I recently visited three national toy sellers, Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us, and BJ's Wholesale Club, to see which electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore’s Law has been working; this year’s tech toy will likely have more power, costing the same and even a little less compared to last year’s.
In addition, while there are generally fewer new toys with associated websites, two of the best-known of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And toys powered by button cells are on the rise, as are toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise noted.)
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, ages 3 and up) are guinea pig-sized stuffed toys that sing a note when their bellies are squeezed.
One squeeze equals one note, and a second squeeze begins to put together a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing in harmony.
Caution: Once you start squeezing, you cannot stop.
For singing combined with dancing, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, 60 dollars, for 2 years and more) is the best option.
Borrowing from last year’s Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays shift change games like Sim<0xC3><0xB3>m Dice, and can make the lunar step, thanks to its innovative articulated feet with locking device wheels.
The children who tested the toy used Mickey as a dance instructor, though his parents complained about the lack of a volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you may remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
He has returned (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for 3 years and up), with a backpack full of question cards designed to turn a car ride into a session with a self-correcting exercise book.
If you are wary of giving your child your smartphone, here you will find three independent alternatives.
VTech’s MobiGo ($60, 3 to 8 years) is the cheapest and easiest to use, featuring a qwerty keyboard; although the games don’t teach as effectively as the Leapster Explorer ($70, 3 to 12 years), it’s the first major tuning of the Leapster line, with a newer, brighter display.
No version is compatible with old cartridges.
Fisher-Price’s iXL ($90, ages 3 to 7) uses an iTunes-like system to present games and e-books, and has an SD card slot that lets you view family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for ages 8 and up) is a game of five blocks just bigger than a matchbox, each with its own LED display.
The goal is to put words together by placing the blocks in a row before time runs out; it is formidable for an impromptu word-building competition.
There are more and more toys that have some kind of online connection.
Based only on their presence in toy stores, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child a pet online at Club Penguin, for example, you can get a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, ($5, ages 6 to 12) that includes a coin with a hidden code.
When you redeem the code online, your child gets enough credits in the Club Penguin store for two items.
These could include roller skates or a Puffle pet toy.
Slightly larger than the bristle of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and up) is the latest in a line of button-cell-powered microrobots.
The fake insect moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs, in random directions.
It is fun to make a maze of blocks to see if you can find the way out.
It is also durable.

A more moderate side of law enforcement in China is promoted
As an urban drill sergeant, Tang Shenbin paced a city plaza, severely inspecting the nervous people in his charge, issuing orders in a low voice with military authority.
He wanted the female members of chengguan, the burly policemen of China’s urban order, feared and despised for their capricious forceful measures and penchant for violence, to convey a certain impression to a handful of spectators.
"Firm!"
"Attention!"
Show them, he whispered, "how pretty girls are!"
Four girls who barely passed adolescence with white gloves and identical olive green jackets and tight pants to draw attention.
Four pairs of perfectly aligned black shoes.
Four elegant hats perfectly placed above the hair tied with blue and white striped bows.
“Personally, I think they look normal,” Mr. Tang said dismissively.
"The models are cute."
More than one government has tried to clean up the image of China’s urban inspectors.
One city ordered all new recruits to have a bachelor’s degree.
The Guangdong Province changed the grayish green color of the uniforms to a supposedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced the use of force with intimidating looks: in 2009, according to one report, 50 officers surrounded a ramshackle snack cart, and watched it with a frown constantly for half an hour, until the peddler picked up his things and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 in Chengdu, has chosen a radical makeover.
Since 2003, the district has added 13 women to its urban police force, specifically chosen for their appearance, proportion and youth.
The idea is to give the rough cop a softer, feminine side.
Regrettably, even Scarlett Johansson would have to fight to increase China’s tiny respect for these city squads.
And for good reason, critics would argue.
Unlike the police, these officers are authorized only to enforce city ordinances, imposing fines and other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese news media routinely portray a different reality.
In January 2008, inspectors from Hubei Province beat a passerby to death after he used his mobile phone to film them as they dissolved a protest against a waste dump.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors was stolen and posted on the internet, describing how to effectively flog criminals without making them bleed.
This year, a Shanghai watermelon peddler suffered brain damage after a brawl with five officers.
A violent video game, available for download online, features Chinese-trained inspectors attacking street vendors.
“Chengguan has left a scar on the government,” lamented China Daily, a national publication, last year after another controversy over tactics.
The newspaper demanded “a really meticulous cleaning.”
Skeptics say the current approach is far from this.
After the district solicited through a notice eight new female recruits in October, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News wondered if the women had real duties or were simply a stage distraction.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district notice called for female candidates ages 18 to 22, with a good figure "and five harmonious facial features."
They must have a height above average, greater than 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 inches.
Withdrawal at the age of 26 is mandatory.
Officials said the work was physically too arduous for women over 25.
“His image is the important thing,” an anonymous district official told Rednet.com, a quasi-government website.
“First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they meet the requirements, such as height, weight, facial features, etc.”
Then comes the temperament “and the inner qualities.”
The female chengguan are like vases, she said, adding, “in addition to being vases, they will have other responsibilities.”
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the district city administration office, is not eager to back up that description.
But he noted that height requirements were standard in many Chinese job ads for both sexes.
Then comes the demand for harmonious facial features.
If this means being handsome, it is a matter of debate among the Chinese.
Surely, the disabled or disfigured should not show up.
"We can't allow a cougar or a hunchback to come to work here," Mr Zheng said.
“His image wouldn’t be good.”
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old, with his cheeks colored and a subtly curved mouth.
She doesn’t think the accent on her looks is sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" he asked with a sardonic look.
His dimpled co-worker, 21-year-old Xu Yang, said “Our work should present the image of the city.”
They also don’t object to their time-bound work, they said, because they harbor greater career ambitions than simply chasing salespeople down the alleys where they’re supposed to circumscribe their business.
Each morning, the squad faces roughly a dozen street vendors who launch themselves on foot or by bicycle, trying to sell as many muffins or tofu bowls as possible before being thrown out.
"Mr. Wang, you have to leave."
"We've told you many times!" said Miss Xu as a salesman escaped on foot, temporarily abandoning his bicycle-drawn cart with noodle garnishes.
Officers describe their duties as more monotonous than exhausting.
“This is pretty much the same every day,” said Huang Jing, 20, who studies marketing in his spare hours.
"Very routine."
One reason is that female officers lack the power of their male counterparts to confiscate merchandise from vendors.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male supervisors.
This tends to protect them from the sudden public displays of animosity against bureaucracy, which are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the provincial capital of Yunnan, rioted after a false rumor spread that a salesman had been killed by chengguan officers.
More than a dozen police or Chengguan officers were injured in the nighttime episode; 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
For the time being, Xindu has avoided such violence.
But calm is hardly guaranteed.
Just two blocks from the peaceful Baoguang Square, where female officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered in a corner.
Officers had confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk instead of in a workshop, as required by regulation.
The owner of the motorcycle was yelling rudely.
The situation stalled for 15 minutes before the officers, with a bad face, elbowed their way to their vehicles and quickly left with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator assigned to the men’s squad, remained behind, his white badge turned to hide his name.
Like female officers, coordinators, men aged 40 and over, play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not taught to maintain an elegant image.
“Sometimes we fight verbally.”
“Sometimes we fight physically,” Mr. Li said quite naturally.
“Most of the time it’s the public that starts the fight.”
Prosecutors will not press charges against Senator Ensign
Attorneys for the senator announced Wednesday that Justice Department prosecutors have cleared Senator John Ensign of criminal charges arising from his affair with a former campaign aide and his efforts to secure work through lobbying for the woman’s husband.
The decision ends the most serious legal threat facing Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was considered as a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012, until the scandal over his affair made national headlines last year and damaged his career.
Ensign's office said it was "surely pleased" with the decision, which came after a year-long investigation.
The senator could still face a disciplinary measure from the Senate ethics committee.
Ensign’s lawyers said the Justice Department had “informed us that Senator Ensign is no longer a target of its investigation and that it has no plan to bring charges against him on this issue.”
The Justice Department declined to comment on the case.
The announcement came as a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Justice Department, who said there appeared to be significant evidence to indicate that Ensign may have colluded to violate a federal criminal prohibition on lobbying.
Interviews, email and other documents first leaked in October 2009 in the New York Times indicated that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his aides, get lucrative work through lobbying, to achieve the silence of Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, over the senator’s affair with her.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as a treasurer for an Ensign campaign.
Ensign contacted several political sponsors to find Mr. Hampton a job and advocated on their behalf after they had hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them, according to the documents and interviews.
As Hampton had recently been an Ensign aide, he was barred under the law from lobbying for his former employer or the Senate for a year.
Ethics experts said the unusual arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, appeared at odds with the so-called “revolving door lobbying ban,” which seeks to restrict former state employees from using their connections to do personal business.
Of the evidence that has been made public, “it appeared to be a prima facie case of a conspiracy to substantially violate the revolving door statute,” said Stanley Brand, a Washington attorney who specializes in defending clients investigated by the government.
While Justice Department officials declined to explain the reasoning behind the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said the department appeared cautious about accepting political prosecutions after several major setbacks for its public integrity section, including last year’s decision to drop prosecution against former Senator Ted Stevens, amid charges of procedural misconduct.
Federal prosecutors “are clearly cowards,” said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Accountability and Ethics in Washington, an advocacy group that brought several complaints against Ensign in the case.
“This basically means that high-ranking government officials can now assume that the laws don’t apply to them,” he added.
Paul Coggins, Ensign’s lead attorney, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a Justice Department prosecutor on Monday and another call the next day, telling him the department did not want to press charges against his client.
Ensign’s defense team had been cooperating with prosecutors in an attempt to persuade them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement Wednesday, “acted in accordance with the law.”
Coggins declined to elaborate on the legal arguments he gave prosecutors.
“I’m not comfortable going into details about my discussions with the Justice Department, I can only say that we thought they made the right decision,” he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to change an investigation into a separate complaint by the ethics group, which alleges that a $96,000 payment from Ensign’s parents to the Hamptons violated federal election law.
The electoral commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money was merely a gift.
NV Energy is a major Nevada company that had long supported the senator, who got the job through lobbying thanks to the help Ensign gave Hampton.
An email sent in December 2008 showed that after the company accepted Hampton as a lobbyist, Ensign's chief of staff, John Lopez, contacted Hampton and told him he was "crushing" the Home Office over a disputed issue.
Ensign also attended a luncheon with Hampton and another Nevada customer, Allegiant Air, and called the transportation secretary to set up a meeting on behalf of the airline after it had hired Hampton to lobby.
When news of the affair first surfaced last year, Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned his position as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After keeping a low profile for many months, two weeks ago Ensign told reporters it planned to run for a third term in the Senate.
When Ensign spokesman Jennifer Cooper announced that Ensign was no longer the subject of a criminal investigation, he said the senator hoped the ethics committee would quickly follow the Justice Department’s lead and conclude its investigation.
“Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his difficult work on behalf of the people of Nevada,” he said.
Cheshire's appeal will target Twitter
There were half a dozen of them "chatting" in the rows of the courtroom.
Minute by minute, they sent reports of the gruesome testimony via Twitter.
In the end, the defense says, there were more than 140,000 Twitter posts about the process that addressed the rape and the children tied to their beds in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, the widely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, is set to come to an official end, with the death penalty judge’s imposition voted on by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes’ lawyers have filed briefs in court outlining the appeals arguments that are likely to occupy the courts for years.
One of the most provocative claims that intense reporting on the process, including the widespread use of Twitter by mass media journalists, created “a circus atmosphere,” and such widespread and immediate saturation with exhilarating details made public passions exert an inappropriate influence on the jury.
The claim could force appellate judges to grapple with the question of whether the new technology requires new rules in the courtroom.
“Based on what I experienced during this process, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of the new technology in the courtroom is affecting the rights of the individual to have a fair trial,” said Thomas J. Ullmann, lead counsel for Mr. Hayes’s defense.
State Superior Court trial judge Jon C. Blue laconically rejected the lawsuits in a ruling last week, saying the news media was “carefully vetted” and that there was no evidence that the jury was driven by passion.
But it probably won’t be the last word on the subject.
For decades, appellate courts have recognized that coverage of celebrity cases can raise questions about the fairness of a process.
In a landmark 1966 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, saying in its decision, in Sheppard v. Maxwell, that there was “a carnival atmosphere in the process” due to the media.
The crime is believed to have been inspired by the television show and the film "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers said that the appellate courts that examined Mr. Hayes’ conviction half a century later might be intrigued by the argument that new rules might be needed to control the form of communication from the courtrooms, something unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard’s case.
“There is a general concern about the impact of new media” on high-profile prosecutions, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who studied Connecticut’s death penalty and wrote a report saying it was imposed arbitrarily.
Professor Donohue said some appellate judges might be intrigued by the idea that limiting immediate communication from courtrooms could make trials fairer.
The Twitter issue is just one of many issues outlined by Hayes’ lawyers, which will likely be discussed for years, delaying an execution.
Defense attorneys also claim, for example, that Hayes could have been harmed when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them creepy photographs of the crime scene during jury selection.
Some jurors have said they were horrified by the photographs of the victims, 48-year-old Jennifer Hawke-Petit and her daughters, 17-year-old Hayley and 11-year-old Michaela.
Defense attorneys say they will also question the constitutionality of the death penalty and argue that the judge improperly removed a jury that had criticized prosecutors, and that he had improperly pressed for a verdict for his bizarre decision to order the jury to deliberate over a weekend.
Jurors were not kidnapped.
But his arguments about the effect of the intense coverage of the process can attract most of the interest.
They noted in a challenge to the verdict filed last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and the U.S. Senate.
They argued that the media continually fueled the fire of emotion over the case.
“The daily throng of tweets from the media, cameras and reporters outside of court,” the lawyers wrote, “was something never seen here in New Haven and perhaps across the state.”
His attention to Tweeter coverage is controversial.
In some interviews, some journalists said the complaint about the fact that immediate news was more important than reports delivered more slowly was a Luddite view that would make the court’s policy on controlling coverage weak in future trials.
But some lawyers said appellate courts were often drawn to arguments about the adaptation that was required in court due to social and technological changes.
Hayes' lawyers are pushing for that claim.
In their brief, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court decision, which overturns Dr. Sheppard’s conviction because of the coverage of the process, and made it clear that they would demand that the new media would require new rules.
“This case,” they wrote, “represents the Sheppard vs. Maxwell case of the 21st century.”
Can civility bridge the divides?
After a remarkable campaign of invective and negativity, a bit of civility has been unleashed in Washington this week.
Is it a harbinger of genuine bipartisan future cooperation or an illusory moment before a quick return to partisan combat in the capital?
Tuesday’s meeting between President Obama and congressional leaders produced no breakthrough on the big issues that need to be addressed during the outgoing session.
But from what everyone says, it was at least a polite discussion about the differences between the two sides, as well as a recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another empty episode to earn partisan points.
Wednesday’s public meeting of the president’s deficit commission was equally civilized, despite the political differences that remain between members.
It seems clear that close interaction over a period of months generated a mutual respect that transcends the ideological gap that still separates members.
That is barely enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Now both sides are in a trial period, probing each other to identify signs of cooperativism and compromise, as they try to assess the limits of public opinion and voters’ patience for a renewed partisan war.
This is why the meeting on Tuesday and the subsequent evaluations of it by the participants were made with a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep-rooted to suggest any rapid climate change that has existed for the past two years.
Whether it’s taxes, expenses, healthcare or social assistance, the two sides are at opposite poles.
Anyway, the November election has softened the mood in Washington, at least in the short term.
“There’s no question that things have changed with respect to the way things are said,” said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official now at the Center for Ethics and Public Policy.
“They are inevitable after the election.
The elections arouse partisan passions, which are then extinguished.
That's good."
On some issues, particularly those on the agenda of the outgoing session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush’s tax cuts are due at the end of the year, and no one is in favor of this.
Both sides want to find a way to preserve some or all of the reductions, permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, there is likely to be a commitment to expand unemployment benefits, probably because Republicans can’t make people believe they are in favor of tax cuts for the rich, denying unemployment benefits for unemployed workers.
After Tuesday’s meeting at the White House, there is greater optimism for a possible deal on these issues during the outgoing session, along with the ratification of the new nuclear disarmament pact START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty).
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation on the pressing issues of the outgoing session will not necessarily lead to continued bipartisanship when the new 112th Congress meets in January.
He said, on the contrary, that it is very likely and even inevitable that a period of disagreement will begin.
“After the things that need to be done are done, in the short term psychology will revert the situation to one of confrontation,” he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism (which is widely shared) that civility can lead to true cooperation.
“I see most of what will happen between now and 2012 as a rehearsal for the main event of 2012,” he said.
The reasons have a lot to do with the constitution of the new Republican majority in the House and the Tea Party voters, who contributed decisively to its creation.
As much as Republican leaders are aware of the dangers of exaggerating their position, they know they must try to keep their promises to cut state spending and overturn the new health care law.
Those partisan lines are already clearly seen in the initial reactions to the deficit commission’s recommendations, which include reforming the tax code and raising some taxes and the retirement age, and cutting spending.
Co-chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the toughest jobs in Washington and, by their own reckoning, have forcibly introduced the deficit issue into the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes on the 18-member commission to publish their plan as an official recommendation, and they have been struggling to get close to that figure.
The greatest resistance is among elected officials on the panel, suggesting that in fiscal matters there is, at least at present, little basis or desire for compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between White House and congressional Republicans.
The first will happen next year in the form of partisan clashes, when Republicans challenge Obama on budget, taxes and health care, followed by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What would cause the change?
The public opinion.
There is considerable evidence that, despite the partisanship of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties working together.
If the confrontation leads to a stalemate, as happened in 1995, then both parties will watch carefully the reaction of the people.
Whoever you think is losing is likely to change course and seek compromise.
However, this may be an optimistic view.
Partisanship and polarization today are greater than they were in the mid-1990s, and there seems to be a bigger ideological gap between Obama and congressional Republicans than there was between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans at the time.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as merely a prelude to a more momentous election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civility shown this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
But this will require much more effort on both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
A leaked U.S. document portrays Moscow as a paradise for corruption
Control of the city is in the hands of a “kleptocracy,” and it leaves a portion of the bribes and protection money it collects directly to the Kremlin, the U.S. Embassy in Russia reported in February.
It was reported that both the police and the Federal Security Service handle huge blackmail systems, which helps explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They raise money not only from legitimate businesses, but also from organized criminal groups.
Every stratum of bureaucracy, what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has termed the “vertical authority,” takes its share as money climbs the ladder.
The memo, which was sent to Washington under the name Ambassador John Beyrle, was published by WikiLeaks on its website on Wednesday.
The note is based on sources whose names have been censored.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow, and he blames it for much of the corruption.
President Dmitry Medvedev fired him in October, but there has been little evidence of a cleanup since then.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a major construction company, have consistently denied corruption allegations over the years, and he has won several lawsuits over such allegations.
In September, when asked on a Russian TV channel about a documentary suggesting he was corrupt, he said: “It’s crazy, it’s a hoax, it’s a nuisance.”
According to polls, Russians overwhelmingly believe that their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual to find the details explained in detail, as they were in the embassy report, and it is unheard of for diplomats from a foreign country to do that.
“The Moscow city government’s direct links to criminality have led some to call it ‘dysfunctional,’ and to claim that the government functions more like a kleptocracy than a government,” the statement said.
“Criminal elements enjoy a ‘krysha’ (a term of the criminal and mafia world that literally means ‘roof’ or protection) that bypasses the police, the Federal Security Service (SFS), the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), and the prosecutor’s office, as well as all sectors of the Moscow city government bureaucracy.
“Analysts identify a three-tiered structure in Moscow’s criminal world.”
"Luzhkov is on top."
“The SFS, the MVD and the militia are on the second level.”
“Finally, common criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level.”
“This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a gap in some areas, because the city doesn’t provide some services.”
The report states that the SFS collects money from larger companies, and that the police target small businesses.
One source, the report said, “explained that Moscow’s business owners understand that it is best to get protection from the MVD and SFS (rather than organized crime groups) as they not only have more weapons, resources and power than criminal groups, but are also protected by law.”
“For this reason, protection against criminal gangs is no longer a priority.”
The memo notes that, while the collection of money is complete, protection may be irregular; even those who pay are subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly find their businesses closed for one pretext or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times about the fight against corruption, but has confessed that he has made little progress.
The embassy note reports men taking suitcases, probably filled with cash, inside the Kremlin itself.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev has to rely on bureaucrats," Georgy Satarov, head of Indem's think tank in Moscow, said in a recent interview.
“But he’s a part of this bureaucracy.”
“He does not belong to a political class, because there is no longer a political class in Russia.”
Without politics, without opposition, without a separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
Nationally, Indem estimates that corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
In a recent survey on global perceptions of corruption conducted by the non-governmental organization Transparency International, the country was ranked 154th (countries are ranked from least to most corrupt).
The disclosure of the U.S. Embassy memo, which did not occur until late at night Moscow time, will surely cause disgust within the Russian government, and even though Luzhkov may be blamed for Moscow’s weaknesses, it could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to argue that it is solving the problem.
Interviewed for CNN by Larry King, Putin suggested that the WikiLeaks documents might be lies and reacted furiously to a revelation claiming that U.S. diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
“The truth of the matter is that this relates to our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic politics in this country,” he said.
“But to be honest with you, we didn’t suspect that this would have been done with such arrogance, with such pressure and, you know, that it would have been done in such an immoral way.”
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to face the past
In a dimly lit concrete classroom, with stained and peeling walls, the headmaster of Anlong Veng High School remembered the man who had built it, the last leader of the Khmer Rouge Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
“He was a good leader and he cared about his people,” said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as “the Butcher” for his brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule, the commander remains popular at this remote former Khmer Rouge stronghold in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure, and where thousands of the organization’s former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, long-held loyalty is finally being challenged at Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation allowed victims to publicly confront people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed here a high school textbook that for the first time teaches the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of their former soldiers.
And in July, a joint United Nations-Cambodia tribunal issued the first conviction of a former Khmer Rouge member, sentencing the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture center, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of those events, anxiety has grown among the Khmer Rouge veterans of Anlong Veng, complicating efforts for reconciliation and their attempts to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
“There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge, but they can’t do anything,” said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Centre, an independent organization that investigates the regime.
“For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil.”
“This is creating divisions within families.”
During the government of the Khmer Rouge of Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, approximately 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, disease or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the Pol Pot-led government in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its military fled to Cambodia’s border with Thailand.
There they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last movement surrendered in December 1998.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led guerrilla warfare from their bases in the mountains and jungles of western Cambodia, Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace deal led to the country’s first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began defecting to the government, culminating in the surrenders of Ieng Sary in 1996, and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had resisted, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the nearby Dangrek Mountains.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Without the support of their benefactors, the older Khmer Rouge fighters fell into the utter misery that is common in rural Cambodia, and many feel nostalgia for the movement.
Although a few elite Khmer Rouge officials retained their local administrative posts in exchange for laying down their arms, privates remain poor and unskilled farmers.
“These people have made few gains since the surrender,” said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which offers public forums across Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
“They have incorporated the regime’s utopian agrarian ideology.”
“They were raised with no concept of doing business.”
Sister Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle near Anlong Veng before turning to life as a poor rice farmer in 1998.
“Life with the Khmer Rouge was fine,” he said.
"Ta Mok fed everyone."
“But now life is difficult because we have to self-supply.”
The current Khmer Rouge court has also caused concerns here.
Early next year, the court is expected to begin prosecuting Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The court’s mandate is to prosecute top leaders and those most responsible for crimes, but it has not said whether it will pursue cases beyond those four.
This did not serve much to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation has focused on 64-year-old Im Chaem, who was a district chief in Banteay Meanchey province during the Khmer Rouge government in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Cambodia Documentation Centre that she had overseen the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project in which thousands of forced laborers are thought to have died.
On a recent muggy afternoon, Im Chaem returned from working in the fields to his house on wooden stilts on a dirt road on the outskirts of Anlong Veng.
When the sun cast long shadows over the parched grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about his past in the Khmer Rouge.
She said that if the court summoned her, she would not show up.
"Cambodia is at peace and stable," he said.
“If there are more prosecutions, there will be war.”
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that there will be instability if the court prosecutes more suspects, although experts and historians question this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But facing the past is precisely what Cambodia must do to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the documentation center.
"Reconciliation, according to Khmer, is to re-unite the broken pieces," he said.
“It’s our obligation to put these broken pieces together so we can understand.”
The center produced the first government-approved textbook on the Khmer Rouge, called “A History of Democratic Kampuchea,” 75 pages long.
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the Ministry of Education’s high school history textbook, which contains less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most of Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng know few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city’s link to the regime.
Toque Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new textbook helped students understand an important part of their story.
But his parents reacted with skepticism when he brought the book home to study.
“My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the court,” he said.
“They have suspicions because they are not sure about how many people the court will prosecute.”
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But public forums, the textbook and the court are starting to make an impact, he said.
Anyway, here the Khmer Rouge retain a powerful charm.
In the Dangrek Mountains, a path with too many weeds and covered with discarded plastic bags leads to a rectangle of black soot covered by a rusty tin roof.
Pol Pot’s body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a cellphone salesman by the side of the road, said he didn’t know much about the man who was cremated there.
“But he has a strong spirit and many locals go there to pray to him,” he said.
It was Nuom Sothea’s birthday, and later that day she decided to walk to Pol Pot’s final resting place, where she would leave a bunch of ripe bananas in hopes of having good luck.
Belarus agrees to give up its stockpile of weapons-grade uranium
In a surprise victory for President Obama’s campaign to protect nuclear material around the world, the government of Belarus announced Wednesday that it will give up its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was revealed in a joint statement released after Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton met with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov on the sidelines of a security summit.
For years, the U.S. government had been trying to persuade Belarus to give up its highly enriched uranium and it looked like they had reached a point of no return last spring.
But U.S. officials told the Washington Post that a pair of classified operations were conducted with Belarus over the past two months to remove 84.82 kilograms of weapons-grade uranium from a Belarusian research facility.
This set the stage for Wednesday’s agreement to remove the rest of the material, about 227 kilograms, according to one official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the confidentiality of the issue.
The deal appeared to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit chaired by Obama in April, which excluded Belarus.
And apparently it was a good achievement to secure the invitation of the former Soviet republic to the next summit in 2012.
“I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit.”
“This shows that this process is working,” said Ken Luongo, president of the Society for Global Security, a group that promotes nuclear safety.
Clinton said the deal is "a very significant and important step" taken by Belarus.
In April 2009, Obama pledged in Prague to protect all vulnerable nuclear material worldwide over the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama’s Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko had declared that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have preserved highly enriched uranium (hundreds of kilograms of what is basically weapon-grade uranium) and low-enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time.
“This is our raw material ... we’re not going to make dirty bombs, and we’re not going to sell them to anybody.”
“We use it for research purposes, that’s all.”
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago, indicating interest in reaching an agreement.
Officials said the first task of removing the uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated, as the material had been lightly irradiated.
Officials said it was loaded onto a special train that traveled more than 2,000 km to a Russian facility for storage and disposal.
According to officials, the second operation ended on Monday and was done by plane.
The U.S. government spent $13 million on the tasks, and most of the money was used to supply Belarus with the low-enrichment uranium research facility, which is not suitable for nuclear weapons.
Andrew Bieniawski, a Department of Energy official working on Global Threat Reduction, said "this was very carefully coordinated and orchestrated to strengthen trust" that led to the deal signed by Clinton.
The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies estimated this year that Belarus possessed at least 40 kilograms of weapons-grade uranium, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will try to eliminate its reserve by 2012, according to the joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, mainly due to Lukashenko’s harsh repression of human rights.
But Wednesday’s statement suggested a potential detente.
While progress on these global security issues is welcomed, the United States and Belarus recognized that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue for improving bilateral relations, and is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens.
The Spanish government did not object to the CIA flights
The Spanish government did not object to CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners to Guantánamo via Spanish territory, the U.S. ambassador to Madrid said in a telegram.
This is reflected in the documents leaked by Wikileaks to the newspaper El Pa<0xC3><0xAD>s, where it is added that the then first vice president of the Government, Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Teresa Fernández de la Vega, asked that the Spanish Executive was informed to "be able to demonstrate that they exercised appropriate surveillance on foreign planes that cross Spain."
In June 2006, following a Council of Europe report accusing a dozen countries, including Spain, of complicity in practices contrary to human rights, a meeting took place between former US ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The vice-president acknowledged that the Council's report "had taken the Zapatero government out of the game" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no qualms about intelligence flights through Spanish territory."
"They simply want to be informed" to avoid being "caught off guard," Aguirre said in a cable.
The then Foreign Minister, Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel Moratinos, told the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give this matter the lowest possible profile, although, being in the hands of the judges, the Government had a limited ability to influence."
For his part, in January 2007, prosecutor Vicente González told the Embassy that he would not try to block the judge’s initiative to request the declassification of the documents of the National Intelligence Center (CNI) and the Ministry of Defense on the CIA flights.
“These reports do not contain any incriminating elements or any sensitive information,” the embassy said after speaking with the prosecutor.
However, the US reflected its concern about the "apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors", rather than the declassified information of the CNI or the Ministry of Defense.
“This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle the case discreetly between governments,” Aguirre said.
At a March 2007 luncheon between the U.S. ambassador and Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, Rubalcaba told him that "although the Spanish judges are furiously jealous of their independence and will do what they deem appropriate," he had instructed his collaborators "to avoid comments of inflamed rhetoric, in an attempt to lower the temperature."
The ambassador also expresses his concern about the performance of the PP in this matter.
“Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience suggests that the PP will not hesitate to capitalize on any indication that the Zapatero government tolerated or deliberately ignored U.S. actions that could be interpreted as potential human rights violations, even if these revelations have negative consequences for the U.S. government,” he said.
The confessed parricide complained in the network of the "ego" of being a mother
The young woman was talking about the child when he was already dead and had a blog: "Terror a la galega"
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" on the net.
With this nickname, which she has used since she was a child, she communicated with a cousin and, at least, a friend; the two natives of Noia, the A Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a town from which she comes.
The messages belong to 2008.
To understand them, it is necessary to know their sentimental life, which ABC reconstructs through the testimonies of their relatives.
The young Galician, 30, began a relationship in 1998 with Iván T<0xC3><0xBA><0xC3><0xB1>ez, an industrialist.
It lasted a year.
When they left, it soon became known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him have the DNA test.
It wasn't long before he met another boyfriend.
The chosen one was Alberto, a boy from Lousame, a neighboring municipality.
He lived with him for a long time.
Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to survey the labor market, the little boy stayed with his partner, who even accompanied her for a week to Palma.
But from the content of the communications, it is seen that their romance was fractured, that they broke up.
In March 2008 she is in Menorca, alone, and writes: "Alberto is very rare and mosqueado, because I have come to work."
“When I told him that, it felt good, but of course, now he realizes what it’s like to be with the child all day and not have the freedom to do whatever he wants.”
Then, he talks about a message to the cell phone he just received: "I want you to come back this month or give me an address to send you to the child."
She complains, “If she doesn’t like me leaving the kid with my mom, I’ll pick him up when I get back.”
In May, he talks about returning to his village: "This week I'm going there, but I'll only be there until the 19th, because the 20th I have to go to a job so I don't lose it."
He explains that if all goes well, he will take his firstborn son.
"He's going to be with whoever he owes, that is, with me, and never in life will I ever think of leaving him again with anyone other than my mother," she said.
In July, there is another post.
When he typed it, the boy, who arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, and was allegedly killed on the 10th, was supposed to be dead.
"Caesar is happy on the one hand, but not on the other."
“On the one hand he’s with me and he likes the place a little bit, but on the other hand he’s going to class almost every day.”
Talk about a transfer to Mallorca.
"He'll go there for a summer class, and I'll save some money from the kangaroo."
On the 17th, memories and complaints.
"A very big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you come."
"Alberto says he sent you I don't know what videos to the email, look how when he wants to find me, you have to fuck yourself."
On the 30th, another: "The child is fine, he goes to summer classes to learn Catalan."
Of Victor, his current partner, there is one: "He advances me money."
On the internet there are messages of his on blogs dedicated to anime and manga.
He even had one of his own in the MySpace universe, now intervened, where he called himself "Muki the Ex-Prisoner."
"Terror a la gallega (ep<0xC3><0xAD>grafo)".
The last man who lived with her, sworn guard, declares his regret for feeling guilty.
She doesn't want to believe it all happened because she didn't tell him she was a single mother.
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica entered yesterday in the provincial penitentiary of Palma, from the center of judicial detainees of Menorca.
The ex-officio lawyer, Carlos Maceda, explained that he does not remember how the events happened, "nor have he intended to cause any harm to the minor."
Before, he confessed that he had drowned Caesar in the bathtub and deposited his body in a suitcase.
The defense and the prosecutor requested a psychiatric test.
The people would win 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of 28-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lleida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase in votes and experienced deputies in the recent regional elections, the Catalan PP already has its sights set on the general elections because, whether it advances or not, the prospects are more than positive, since the number of votes that this formation obtains in those elections usually doubles the one it receives in the Catalan ones.
Thus, the popular Catalans obtained 610,473 votes in the general elections of 2008, while in the regional elections of 2006, the figure amounted to 316,222.
Last Sunday, the PPC won 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend is maintained, which has been nourished by a transfer of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of the PP electorate, analysts of this formation have calculated that, if general elections were held, the PPC could go from 8 to 12 deputies in Congress, while CiU would also win four (it now has 10) and the PSC would lose no less than 9 deputies (it has 25).
These calculations would confirm that the Catalan square is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the popular ones, ERC would lose one deputy - now it has three - while ICV would stay with one deputy or win one.
But, if the electoral calendar is maintained, the most immediate appointment will occur in May 2011 with the municipal elections, where the popular can also be decisive in the end of the socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in its replacement at the head of the Diputaci<0xC3><0xB3>n de Barcelona, one of the administrations that manages more budget - 661 million euros for 2011 - .
Both nationalists and popular agree on the possibility that the PSC will lose the municipalities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lleida and Girona, where the socialists would not obtain a majority or the possibility of resorting to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Given the Republican debacle, it would not be unreasonable for this formation to lose its representation in the Barcelona Consistory - 5% of the votes are needed - .
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lleida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can lead the overthrow in the Tarragona capital, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lleida, the PP has been only 500 votes away from the PSC, whose mayor, <0xC3><0x80>ngel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they met on several occasions.
The popular ones have also grown in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in the maximum number of populations.
The Catalan cell provided thousands of passports to Al Qaida
In addition to the seven arrested in Barcelona, there were three in Thailand.
The seven Pakistanis and the Nigerian detained by agents of the General Information Commissioner of the Police in Barcelona formed a jihadist cell that, directed from Thailand, provided passports to different groups of Al Qaida, including "The Tigers for the Liberation of the Tamil Land" (LTTE) and "Laskar and Taiba" (Let), the latter author of the attacks in Bombay that caused the death of the
The Ministry of the Interior has given great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that with the “Operation Kampai” the Al Qaida counterfeiting apparatus has been “weakened” at the international level and, “therefore, its operational capacity”.
The investigators calculate that the cell, in the two years it has been active in Catalonia, has been able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were falsified and then distributed to the groups that make up the criminal galaxy Al Qaida so that their "fighters" can cross the borders of Europe and other Western countries with total impunity.
The cell dismantled is not the only one that the jihadist network had operational in Europe, hence the investigations have participated, in addition to the Thai services, other European police units, so it is not ruled out that in the territory of the EU in the coming days similar blows developed on the night of last Tuesday in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested), in Thailand another was developed with the capture of the Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Arshad.
These were the ones who directed from Bangkok the cell established in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of it was hit in 2009 - mainly stole from tourists passports that met the requirements marked by the so-called "World Islamic Front".
That is, the documents had to be in the name of men between 25 and 45 years old, with a validity of several years and without stamped visas.
At the moment, no data has been found that links those arrested in Catalonia with the attack in Bombay, despite the fact that the author of this attack, "Laskar and Taiba", was one of the groups receiving the stolen passports in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, it should be remembered that days before this attack was committed, from Catalonia were sent through a transfer agency about a thousand dollars that were "invested" in the purchase of mobile cards that were then used by the members of the "commando" that ended the lives of 106 people.
The police have seized a large amount of documentation.
The PP demands to More to park the fiscal concert
The leader of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose to Artur Mas his conditions to support his investiture as president of the Generalitat, identical to those already raised during the campaign and which are summarized in giving priority to the recovery of the economy and do without pro-sovereignist adventures, as is the economic concert that the nationalist leader wants to raise in the equator.
The president of the Catalan popular attended the meeting of Artur Mas with the security that gives to have obtained 18 deputies in the elections last Sunday, a figure more than enough to be loved, because the candidate of CiU needs at least one of the formations that will exercise the opposition to abstain in the investiture vote.
A possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances that the nationalists want to maintain in the Congress when general elections are held, but, for the moment, the conversations that Mas maintains these days with the rest of the political leaders are done in a Catalan key.
And as for the PP president, to support an investiture "will have to park all the sovereignist and independence speeches", as well as the economic concert - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the convergent leader intends to even submit to a referendum.
Both leaders have in common their commitment to thin the political apparatus of a highly inflated autonomous administration and the elimination of the inheritance tax and donations.
The details of the negotiation on the investiture of Mas will be dealt with by the PPC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a tough opposition -, Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do so with Joan Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatric hospital claims that the deaths were not due to "lack of measures"
The owners of the center of Olot do not rule out that its warden killed more than 11 elderly
The heads of the geriatric La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) offered yesterday a press conference to highlight the damage that has caused the institution the criminal conduct of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who while he was there employed killed at least eleven elderly in his charge.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, appeared accompanied by the lawyer of the center, the lawyer Joan Ca<0xC3><0xB1>ada, and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be to be able to exercise the accusation against the responsible" of the deaths but "the legality and the responsibility force us to assume the procedural situation of civil responsibles".
In addition to the social discredit that the entity may suffer for not having detected in time the criminal activities of the guardian, the great threat to La Caritat now takes the form of substantial compensation that the legal representatives of the relatives of the victims are already calculating.
Joan Vila Dilmé has confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that since then it has not stopped killing.
The judge already pointed out in the car that ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the geriatric - that he suspected that in many cases no doctor personally explored the deceased but, taking into account the age and pathologies of the patients, the procedure was dispatched by phone.
La Caritat, through its director, yesterday strongly denied this extreme and pointed out that "the lack of measures can not have been at any time the cause of what has happened".
The lawyer for La Caritat added that "in the case there is not a single indication that there has been a reckless action by anyone other than the accused himself."
He confessed to 11 murders the day before yesterday and detailed that the first crime was committed on August 29, 2009 to, a month and a half later, kill a second grandmother.
In this case he caused his death by overdosing on insulin, unlike the first crime he committed by using a mixture of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat points out that it is difficult to control that the staff of the center have access to medicines.
Insulin shots and a sedative cocktail would have been the mechanism employed in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in his eagerness to relieve the suffering of the inmates, used to kill them.
But it will be the analyses that are being made in the laboratory that will have to clarify if Vila does not lie and sought for his first victims a less cruel death or if, on the contrary, he burned them inside giving them bleach as he has already confessed that he did with the three women he killed between October 12 and 17.
In La Caritat they do not give credibility to the manifestations of the janitor, not even to the number of murders confessed, which do not rule out that it is superior, and justify their attitude in the different versions that Vila has given in his visits to the court and in the little sense that he has to change his way of proceeding after having committed, successfully, eight murders.
That is why they say that they put themselves at the disposal of justice to clarify the scope of this event.
The ECB threatens
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to Trichet’s threat yesterday that “markets should not underestimate our ability to react.”
Peripheral spreads have closed strongly and European banks’ shares have risen more than 5%.
However, we should also not underestimate the ECB’s ability to make mistakes and the euro has barely picked up, which is a worrying sign.
What has occurred yesterday is typical of an illiquid market that just as it collapses recovers but motivated by the closure of short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor will soon lose the fear.
A month ago the ECB summoned us today to withdraw liquidity measures and will have to retract tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and those that remain.
The Bundesbank demanded to end the plan to buy public debt because it was ineffective and to eliminate all extraordinary measures of liquidity over time and leaving only unlimited access per week.
Following the Irish crisis we expect them to extend the current liquidity measures “at least until March” and hold the quarterly auction with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We also expect them to continue their bond-buying program and even give the signal to step it up.
If they do not meet the expectations generated they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they remain obsessed with withdrawing liquidity measures, God help us!
As in their May meeting in which they claimed that they had not even contemplated buying bonds and collapsed the markets, history could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka on Monday and on Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a further slump in the market.
Yesterday the auction of letters to a year in Portugal has been very poor.
The Treasury only issued $500 million at 5.28%, versus $750 million at 4.81% from the previous auction.
Still, rates in Portugal fell 30 basis points across the curve, clearly reflecting a shift in market sentiment following Trichet’s words.
In Ireland, figures for the Allied and Bank of Ireland hole have been made public.
The estimated figures are about 10 billion in the short term and another 15,000 potential and have until February to get private capital or be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after failing to detect the problem in July with the stress tests, the figures are acceptable within the Aid Plan and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the government will have to get parliamentary approval of its new budget and still does not have enough support, so Ireland remains a focus of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated the tone of her speech to ease the tension ahead of the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December in which a political commitment is needed to show that we are a union and that we all play the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the rest Beethoven’s anthem of joy.
In Spain, the president had the gift of the opportunity to present yesterday the plan of measures that will be approved on Friday by the Council of Ministers.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous communities and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to revive employment ring in the ears of investors like the four Vivaldi seasons.
The double effect of Trichet and ZP explains that the Spanish stock market has risen 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of European stock exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been quick and forceful and we are benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect so we hope it will resolve with strong demand and help dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain to ask for a Relief Plan would be self-immolation.
They would give us a liquidity line that we do not need, the Treasury has more than 40 billion in available liquidity, triple that in March, at very expensive rates and closes access to the markets sine d<0xC3><0xAD>e.
However, the strategy must remain that of Caesar's wife, "in addition to being so, look like it."
Cheer up, we can.
The president of Eulen will challenge the board of Vega Sicilia requested by his children
The storm does not ease in the open conflict in the Alvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, founder of the group, will challenge, considering it "full annulment", the judicial board of El Enebro on the 16th, requested by five of his seven children and in which they will try to assert their majority and take over the management bodies of the titular firm of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez and his sons Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s David and Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a José are tuning the legal battery for the new judicial chapter in their litigation for control of part of the group.
The founder of the largest holding company of business services to the company does not seem willing to yield in his litigation to be present in the governing bodies of El Enebro.
He was dismissed from his board of directors by five of his seven children who were appointed directors at the shareholders’ meeting of January 18 of this year and whose challenge is recorded in the Mercantile Register.
The judicial board of El Enebro for the next day 16, convened by the magistrate of the Mercantile Number 2 of Madrid, has opened again the box of thunders in the bosom of the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family.
The recourse to the judge to fix the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only legal mechanism that guarantees the convening of the meeting.
The latest move by Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira <0xC3><0x81>lvarez Mezquiriz, is described by David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez as a "desperate recourse of the applicants their five children to, through procedural cunning, in clear fraud of Law and abuse of right, try to validate and heal the radically null junta of January 18", according to its official spokespersons.
This argumentation will be the basis for, once the meeting has been held, proceeding to its challenge by considering that it is "null by right".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already tried unsuccessfully that the magistrate convene a meeting in June.
In El Enebro, patrimonial company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, the seven sons of David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the service group claims, however, the usufruct over 51% of the capital, according to family protocols.
This matter is the substantive issue to be decided by the judge after the hearing of the challenge, for which no date has yet been set.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with secret weapon from Siemens
Software designs improvements to cars in real time.
Since Red Bull broke into the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this select universe of speed has been marked by surprise and success.
At first, no one took into consideration the options of a newly arrived team and, despite the upward trajectory of the last seasons, last November, in the final stretch of the championship everyone bet on the triumph of Fernando Alonso’s Ferrari.
Without detracting from the skill as a driver of the eventual champion, the German Sebastian Vettel, nor the ability of the Renault engine that powers his car, in the world of Formula 1 has become a legend the "secret weapon" that the multinational Siemens has put in the hands of Red Bull to turn it into a winning team.
It is actually a powerful process simulation software that the German company put on the market in 2007 for purposes far removed from high-level motorsport.
Called PLM, this powerful computer instrument has been used to design assembly lines of manufacturing factories around the world, power plants, high-precision instruments.
The objective is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding failures and avoidable expenses.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan’s most celebrated utility cars.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the industrial division of Siemens, explains that the use of this computer instrument in its Formula 1 factory has allowed Red Bull to design and carry out "in a few hours, almost in real time", the modifications, changes and improvements that are detected during races and in tests.
Russwurm explains that in 1992 the teams had an average of 10 technicians in their team who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements to the vehicles during each season.
The Red Bull team now employs 180 highly qualified young professionals who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyse and project all kinds of modifications to the cars.
The Siemens executive explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all the elements of the Red Bull cars with the exception of the engine, which is the sole responsibility of Renault.
The materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
The changes can be brought from simulator virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
As the only limitation of this madness of technological improvement is the figure of 40 million dollars that each Formula 1 team can spend at most in each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has set up the high-tech factory to design and produce its cars in a town about 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings in which visits are restricted, especially for journalists.
Everything that happens there is considered "high secret".
The staff for this task amounts to 580 people, including its two drivers, the champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of Red Bull Formula 1 is without a doubt the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the energy drinks brand has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other protagonists whose competition is inestimable and their notoriety null.
The factory’s chief technology officer, Steve Nevey, says that five years ago it could be said that R&D advances in wagon cars accounted for 50% of the wins and the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have varied and the technology adds 85% of the success, while the pilots contribute 15% of the added value.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computers as "they are unpredictable gladiators".
HP to install 20 in-house stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened yesterday in Barcelona its first exclusive store in collaboration with its partner Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of the network of 20 stores of between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational plans to install in Spain over the next two years.
The company will make this initiative compatible with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centers such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice president of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, gave as an example the remodeled store located on the Gran V<0xC3><0xAD>a in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom she has collaborated for 30 years.
The North American group has prepared a plan to locate 200 branded points of sale in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes all 20 Spanish establishments.
The first to open were Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, with Barcelona third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the following possible openings, although he acknowledged that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HP personal systems assured that the philosophy to install the stores will always be the same, relying on a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and is responsible for the exclusive furniture design of the stores (with products that can be touched interactively), which in Europe will have an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of the staff of the establishments.
Helena Herrero denied that it was a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of shops aims to "improve customer service and SMEs in the purchase, attention, after-sales and even packaging."
The Barcelona store includes a space with a pioneering pilot program worldwide that is responsible for solving the possible problems of HP computer equipment under warranty.
An online service connects with a technical center located in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"So, in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can sometimes take up to two days."
"This system is designed especially for SMEs and users, since large companies already have contracted technical assistance services," said Helena Herrero yesterday.
Sabadell commits to 'stealing' one million customers from its rivals in three years
More optimistic than other executives, the CEO of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be a hard year for banking, but initially rules out a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the passive war.
Despite this, it foresees a collapse in interest margins, which will be partly offset by increases in commissions and the price of credit.
Sabadell expects to attract one million private customers in three years, its pending subject.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the next three years and thus be able to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will launch a new three-year master plan in 2011.
The objective, in addition to surviving without the need to resort to public aid from the FROB, is to gain market share with the capture of one million new private customers -700,000 if those who can leave the bank are discounted-, its great pending subject, since until now it had pampered more SMEs and companies than the retail customer.
This year it has attracted 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share in private individuals is 3.5%, while in companies it exceeds 10%.
Another of the bases of the 2011-2013 plan is the commitment to productivity, or what is the same, austerity, with cost reduction as a goal, and whose challenges will be exposed by the bank when it presents the results of the year.
Few banks in these times dare to set goals and make them public as the financial crisis has upset all the plans of the world banking.
Sabadell, in fact, will close this year its Optima master plan, set four years ago, although initially it was for three, but the situation of the markets made it expand one more year.
Customers who let the savings boxes escape will be their main target.
At a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 is going to be a "difficult and momentous" year.
The executive, in fact, believes that the exit from the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
Moreover, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs", something fundamental for the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And, although he believes that the war of liabilities – which penalizes margins – is shrinking, the price of risk premiums that banks and cashiers are paying for their issuances to obtain liquidity are already moving to the price of credit to compensate for the fall in margins.
“The issue of liquidity and financing is structural, and it’s going to be a pressure factor on credit.”
"We haven't closed the tap, but the differentials are higher," Guardiola said.
Banesto already gave orders to his network on Thursday to limit long-term credit and raise the price of spreads - see CincoD<0xC3><0xAD>as on November 22 and 27 -.
He also acknowledged that the tendency of banking now "is to raise commissions", but "there is a competitive framework".
Sabadell’s master plan is based on organic growth, although, as always, the group does not rule out corporate operations.
Not in vain, he says that in Spain "larger sizes will be required."
“Next year everything is going to move,” he said.
He says that capital needs are "up a lot" and does not rule out that some Spanish financial institution enters in red numbers.
And points out that the FROB can supply the market in raising funds in the face of new recapitalizations.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, he downplayed what some bankers are already predicting as a new liquidity crisis.
He points out that it cannot be issued, but contrary to what happened in June, short-term financing can be obtained through repos, which cushions the crisis.
The ECSC rules out a second wave of mergers in
The ECSC Director General, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday ruled out a wave of savings bank mergers and again insisted on the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is being carried out.
When the process of concentration of Spanish savings banks began, several entities assured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they would be reserved for the second round.
However, the general director of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, ruled out yesterday that this new wave of operations will occur.
"I think the biggest part of the mergers has been done, the incorporation of Cajasol to the Civic Banking group can not be said to be a second round, what there are adjustments."
"Most of it is completely done; maybe instead of 17 we go to 13 or 14 but all the big processes have already been done and supervised by the Bank of Spain, which has collaborated a lot too," said the director.
In statements during a breakfast of the Association of Directors and Executives of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta has exposed that the process of concentration is being undertaken "at the highest possible speed, and we have to be very satisfied with how it is produced in the deadlines that in its day, not now, were marked in the business plans with the Bank of Spain", he emphasized.
“Going from 45 banks with an average of 28.5 billion assets to 17 with 75.5 billion is a process that is unparalleled in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% so that they are much larger to comply with Basel,” he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a series of rather unlucky opinions about the slowness of the process" that demonstrate "a lack of seriousness and meaning", because "what the Bank of Spain does is to remember that we have to be within the deadline before the end of the year".
The director general of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, said yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in all of Europe and "probably" in the world, and attributed a "lack of knowledge" to those who question it.
The director pointed out that, within the current economic situation, "we can be very calm" with the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, a system that has undertaken a "very important" concentration process and that "goes as fast as possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish banking system came off very well from the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Shoemaker and the German Red Line
Berlin has chosen to remain in the euro, but has set the conditions for the whole of the Union.
Tensions in the markets have prompted a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero has advanced new adjustment measures, from tax reductions for SMEs, regulation of private placement agencies or suppression of the 426 euros of aid for unemployed without benefit, to the privatization of 49% of AENA, the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and 30% of State Lotteries.
On the other hand, Vice President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, has joined the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel for her responsibility in unleashing the current crisis.
How are these movements to be interpreted?
Keep in mind that Merkel’s position is not a mistake in her communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another twist in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which clashes with that of maintaining the old traditions of a good part of its partners.
Faced with European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate about the three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, made up of itself, Austria and the Netherlands, among other countries, while the south would leave the currency zone.
The second, the recovery of the framework, although it now seems science fiction, with a very favorable current of opinion, close to 50% of the population.
The third, a redesign of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigour, fines for transgressing countries, possible suspensions of payments of some of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and has been defined for a long time, so now there are no excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission were stimulating deficits, the German government pulled out of its sleeve a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany believed should be done (plans of fiscal rigour and stability in public finances), and what its European partners, including France, were practicing.
The second on the front was given by the Central European country when Merkel painfully extended the decision to save Greece.
Already then it was the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public and published opinion were very much against the bailout of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel again emerges with a clear position, demanding the reform of the Union treaties, to make it possible to save a country and, at the same time, force private lenders to bear part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as it has precipitated the Irish crisis and everything else.
But your proposal, although somewhat sweetened, has been approved and, in the coming months, we should attend the process of reform of the Union that makes those measures possible from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not intend to cross.
And he is telling us all that, even if we have to take measures now with which he may not agree, from that date the old functioning of the euro will have ended.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary area, in which the offending countries will be severely sanctioned, may be forced to declare themselves in suspension of payments and, in that case, the private sector will also bear part of the cost.
Germany is pointing out to us that we must follow a severe growth path with high savings and investment rates, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
Another alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, such as the one that has presided over Spanish growth in the boom years, simply will not tolerate it.
The invitation is clear.
And we'd be wrong not to understand it.
It is not just a question of reducing the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they demand of us is much harder.
And the worst thing we could do in these circumstances is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will give way to greater calm.
And that we take advantage of the window of opportunity that they have given us, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also understood this and his double manifesto (the reforms promised after last Saturday’s meeting with big companies and yesterday’s announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite the criticism of Merkel, the thesis that order must be put at home has opened its way.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and it doesn’t look like they’re going to move it.
And, among the possibilities that are contemplated, that of leaving a monetary zone too crowded with unserious countries, it cannot be excluded.
Then Germany will always be able to tell us that it had already warned us.
Sports and Law Fraud
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax show ingenuity but no willingness to escape a penalty.
The alleged ejection of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the match played on November 23 against Ajax in the Champions League has caused rivers of ink to be written about whether or not such behavior is unsportsmanlike and whether, eventually, both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is well known, with a few minutes to go before the end of the match (their team had clearly won), the two players deliberately lost time when it came to catching fouls to cause the referee to show them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid will end up as leader of their group, both players will comply with the regulatory sanction in the next game of the league, against Auxerre, and they will be able to pass clean of cards to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA disciplinary committee has sanctioned the team's coach, José Mourinho, with two matches and with different economic amounts to the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, but rather common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, of the unwritten rules, but followed, of this sport.
Part of the debate that arose in the case reported is due to the fact that it has been starred by a team of the Real Madrid entity (which in its anthem boasts of nobility and honor, and which on previous occasions has fined its players for similar acts) and to the dramatization orchestrated, apparently, by Mourinho, who adds one more episode to his long history of histrionic and provocative coach.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this type of behavior not expressly prohibited by the regulations contradicts the principles of sport, that is, whether these actions commit fraud of law; because, in fact, they are actions respectful of the sports regulations, but seem to elude their meaning.
The question is to examine the kind of damage they cause to the spirit of sport.
One of the goods that sportsmanship understands is the physical integrity of the opposing players, an aspect that with these actions was not put in danger, that is, there was no violent game.
Another of these goods to which fair play is alluded to is to prevent the team of the offending players from taking unfair advantage of the opposing team, which did not happen either.
Now, the paradox of the action of the Real Madrid players is that they did not adapt to what we normally characterize as cheating or fraud of law, because their violation of the rules was not done in secret to try to avoid the sanction, but precisely their action tried to be the most obvious so as to receive the punishment of the referee.
They expected and gladly accepted the sanction.
Another issue is what kind of advantage violators gain in the intentional fouls examined.
Here it seems necessary to verify that the opponent is not put at a disadvantage or profit in the same match, because obviously the result of the action means leaving the team with fewer players.
And it is not a useful strategy for the next match, because the club will not be able to count on those players.
The advantage, obviously, is that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future match.
But it is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indeterminacy, because the team can be eliminated at the first change, and also with this performance the players meet a penalty match and move to the second cycle of cards, in which the suspension by accumulation of cards occurs with one less than in the first cycle.
So, going through rounds, it is not so clear that it is an advantage.
In short, these actions do not go against the spirit of sport, of which it is part to make strategic decisions that favor making the most of what the rules allow.
In the case at hand, the players did not act to evade the application of the sanction (this would be a clear case of law fraud), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without getting around the punishment or running away from it.
Although the line between ingenuity and law fraud is blurred, this time I think it was a clear case of ingenuity.
The controversy, it seems to me, arises from two factors: because it was two self-expulsions and because of the way in which the transmission of the directive to provoke them was carried out.
The damage done to the principles of sport by these actions is not so much ethical as aesthetic.
Offensive of offers to capture the Christmas dinners of groups in BCN
The dictatorship of the calendar concentrates this year an avalanche of reserves for the days 16 and 17.
Self-suffrage celebrations proliferate by employees, who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the nougat and the lottery, with the arrival of December also return the pre-Christmas group dinners, which continue to act as an oxygen balloon for the restoration and leisure of Barcelona, but because of the crisis have led to an offensive of adjusted prices to capture the majority customer: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros in dinners or meals, coincide the entrepreneurs and associations of the sector.
To finish complicating the accounting, this year’s calendar (when New Year’s Eve falls on Friday) has concentrated the requests in the week of December 13, with the result to date of an avalanche of dinner reservations for peak days (16 and 17) and barely movement for the previous week.
As has been happening since 2008, when the lean cow stage began, there are many companies that have eliminated the group dinners for budgetary reasons.
In order not to do without tradition, many workers keep it paying out of their own pocket.
Whatever the situation, both demand battle prices, confirms the president of the Restoration Guild of Barcelona, Gaiet<0xC3><0xA0> Farr<0xC3><0xA0>s.
The representative of the employer, to this day, does not dare to predict what the celebrations of this month will be like.
"People think about it a lot before booking."
"He wants to leave but he has the alerts on the subject of prices," he says.
The business will do well "to those who give quality at a good price and with good service", he adds, and remembers that customers tend to go down a notch with the crisis, so that the band around 25 euros has become the majority in demand.
In a survey in several central establishments, the collapse of petitions for the night of the 17th is verified.
In the Soteras group indicate that there is a real boom of requests for that Friday, with the intention of spending less than 30 euros, to which they have responded by adapting their menus to the situation, with complete formulas from 25 to 35 euros.
In another of the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to more early booking, even since the beginning of November.
“We have done the impossible to maintain the same prices of last year, with menus for all tastes from 19.95 to 30 euros,” they detail.
At AN Grup, led by El Mussol, Attic, QuQu, and up to a total of 23 stores, they remain optimistic after detecting a rise in turnover since the second half of the year and good, although concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources of the group highlight that the 18th will also be a hyperactive day at the level of groups of friends who pre-celebrate the parties.
To their six group menus they have added a Christmas menu, with 30 euros or more as a star budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend 10% more than last year in exchange for demanding more details, such as cava.
They also see green shoots in some companies that re-invite their employees and feel that the volume of groups is somewhat higher.
On the part of the employers Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Leisure of Barcelona), its vice-president, Enric Gom<0xC3><0xA0>, hopes to start seeing the end of the tunnel and maintains that together the reservations are "animated", although the customers "negotiate to the fullest".
But the joy of celebration has not gone down, whoever pays, he says.
Pakistan's nuclear program raises concerns in the US
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at "a faster rate than any other country."
Wikileaks leaks confirm links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The contents of the correspondence between the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department leaked by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns caused in Washington by the Pakistani nuclear program.
Apart from the enlightening and juicy details they offer about the content of the talks and the thoughts of the US diplomatic representatives accredited in Islamabad, the documents reveal that the cooperation between the two countries in atomic security, instead of increasing, "decreases", and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster pace than any other country in the world".
The peculiarity of Pakistan’s nuclear program – that the weapons are not assembled but remain stored by components to hinder their destruction in case of attack – is one of the main reasons for vigilance in Washington.
This is what the ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, lists in a report prior to the visit of the then National Security Advisor, James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to territory under Taliban attack, the rumored dispersion of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials."
The high number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programs is regarded, not only by the US, but also by Russia, as proliferating and reason to keep guard.
"Pakistan has had to hire personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the fall in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work in nuclear or missile programs," Russian Foreign Ministry expert Yuri Korolev said at a meeting with his U.S. counterparts.
The latest in the documentation leaked by Julian Assange’s website is the dwindling cooperation between the US and Pakistan on issues of nuclear proliferation and Pakistan’s high pace of nuclear weapons production.
An embassy dispatch in May, which described communication with Pakistan as “frustrating,” said: “Transparency is often non-existent; offers of aid go unanswered or are discarded.”
In another message, Peter Lavoy, National Intelligence Officer for South Asia, notes that "despite economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world."
Ambassador Patterson also asked Washington, during a visit by the head of the Army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to make it “very clear” to the responsible that “the Pakistan Army must end tacit support for terrorist groups.”
On the hunt for the Wikileaks boss
Obama appoints a top counterterrorism official to prevent further leaks.
Interpol issues a red alert in order to track Assange’s movements and locate him wherever he is.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to be certain about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a “red alert” to “locate and track the movements” of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
It is not new, but dates back to November 20.
And it has nothing to do with the latest leak of more than a quarter of a million U.S. diplomatic documents but with the allegations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
Mark Stephens, a lawyer for WikiLeaks founder, said: “The police know where and how to contact Mr Assange.
It was on the 20th when the international police force based in Lyon (France) issued the order at the request of Sweden, but did not disclose it until yesterday, after receiving authorization from the authorities of that country.
As such, all 188 Interpol countries have indications of identifying or locating Assange “with a view to his provisional arrest and extradition.”
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, as the organization has explained, do consider the so-called network notice freeway to proceed with an arrest -which must be undertaken by the national police force-, especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case in Sweden and England, where Assange is believed to be.
The move has outraged Assange’s lawyers, who yesterday published a letter denouncing that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks has been willing to respond by videoconference to questions from Swedish authorities.
They also recall that Assange requested and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, whom they compare to the mythical Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin’s head of security.
“This looks like a hunt, not a legal pursuit,” the letter said.
As the world searches for him - and from Australia his mother defends her son's innocence - Assange remains unaccounted for, but not silent.
On Monday, he gave an interview to the editor of Time magazine via Skype, a conversation in which he called for the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
“If it can be shown that he was responsible for ordering U.S. diplomats to spy at the U.N. in violation of international treaties that the U.S. has signed, he should resign,” he said.
White House press secretary Robert Gibbs called the resignation “ridiculous and absurd.”
“I’m not entirely sure why we should care about a guy’s opinion on a website,” he told CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a senior counterterrorism official, Russell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
The attempt by President Barack Obama’s spokesman to downplay Assange stands in contrast to the views of conservative politicians and commentators these days.
Peter King, the congressman who will chair the House Homeland Security Committee from January, has asked the State Department to consider including WikiLeaks on the list of terrorist organizations "to intervene and their funds and pursue anyone who gives them any contribution or aid."
Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, has had to recant after saying Assange should "be killed".
“Obama should make it a target and use a drone or something.”
The unapologetic was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and a possible presidential candidate.
“Whoever leaked the information in the government is guilty of treason and anything other than execution would be too kind a punishment,” he told Fox News.
Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s seeks peace in ERC with nods to those related to Carod
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s seems to have found the recipe to get around the umpteenth internal revolt in the ranks of ERC, without north because of the loss of 11 deputies and half of the votes.
The president of the party is aware that his resignation is insufficient for those related to the former leader Josep Llu<0xC3><0xAD>s Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of that sector is today as diluted as his own mentor and that it can not cause him the headaches he had with other extinct currents.
For this reason, the leader of Esquerra will try to win over the new critics with winks that will allow him to shield himself until the municipal elections.
For starters, Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s announced yesterday that the more than 200 national councillors of ERC will be able to pronounce on its continuity in secret.
Through ballots, and not out of hand.
If the carodistas want to convey a certain vote of punishment to the president, they can do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the leader of the ranks wants to avoid the image of division as much as that of subjugation to his person.
In several interviews, he said that it would not be considered ratified with half plus one of the votes, but added, without specifying percentages, that it would not be good a result "to the Bulgarian".
Those close to Carod demand more from the president than putting his office at the disposal of the militancy, a gesture that is not valid when Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s controls the highest organ between congresses.
But not having the majority to force resignations, they will try to agree with the executive a road map between now and May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the elaboration of the strategic reorientation document that the management will submit to the vote of the national council on the 18th.
Its intention is to endorse Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s in exchange for the latter promising to bring forward the congress to autumn 2011, something that the summit already takes for granted.
The ERC leader acknowledged that “polyphony” harms stability and that its goal is to make the organization once and for all able to wash away the dirty rags from doors inward.
Along these lines, the article signed by Acting Minister Josep Huguet on his blog is symptomatic.
Considered the ideologue of Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s, the head of Innovaci<0xC3><0xB3> assumed that the leader will be endorsed "in exchange for various objectives".
And he listed five, of which two stand out.
The first, to "recompose" the executive to represent at least 90% of the militancy, that is, to include new faces that come from the sector related to Carod.
The second may be the big news.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquidate the assembly as a mechanism of operation.
Thus, it advocates a reform of the statutes that allows congresses to be held through delegates elected by suffrage.
Ending the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, has been an obsession of the Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s team, which has already fought in this regard in the last two congresses.
In fact, the convulsive conclave of 2008 left the task to the management to review the assembly in a specific congress of reform of statutes.
This appointment is still pending, as the internal tide of recent years discouraged addressing the issue.
Now, with no critical sectors lurking, it may be a good time to take it up again and try to shut it down forever.
23 executed in November; 290 during 2010
According to the MILENIO State of Mexico count, there was a decrease of four cases compared to 2010.
During November, 23 people were executed in the State of Mexico, four fewer than the previous month according to the state of Mexico.
Among the murders are that of three women and the discovery of a pair of severed bodies in the Valley of Mexico.
In the penultimate month of the year, there were 390 deaths allegedly related to organized crime.
Among the cases is that of a corpse found in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, municipality of Toluca.
The subject had at least three gunshots and the grace shot to the head in addition to the feet and hands tied with wire.
The next day, the body of a subject was found in a suitcase inside the trunk of an abandoned vehicle on Mixtecas Street, in Colonia Santa Cruz Acatlán, in the municipality of Naucalpan.
In the early hours of Thursday, Ejidatarios found a body with signs of torture and at least three lethal shots in the chest, on the Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal toll highway, in the stretch that crosses the municipality of Villa Guerrero.
Next to the body was found a message allegedly signed by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
A day later in Nezahualc<0xC3><0xB3>yotl, a 50-year-old man was killed by eight bullets after leaving his home to start garbage collection work.
On November 7, two 30-year-olds were killed by a bullet to the head each in the San Pedro Xaloxtoc colony, municipality of Ecatepec.
In Chalco, with the shot of grace in the forehead was found the corpse of a man in a lonely road of the Colony El Naranjo and under the body they found a percussion cap of firearm calibre 25.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the sewage canal of the Playa Golondrina colony.
Emergency services carried out an exhaustive search of the other members of the body, however they were not located.
Neighbors of Tepotzotlán alerted about the discovery of a corpse that was in the Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Colorada area, which was tied by the hands back and with its head bandaged.
The man had a gunshot wound to the back of his neck.
In the middle of the month, the execution of two men was reported, who were wrapped in blankets and abandoned in the trunk of a vehicle in the streets of the Villas de la Hacienda subdivision in the municipality of Atizapán de Zaragoza, along with the victims were also discovered two messages of death warnings.
A day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony, in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby colony was found wrapped in a black plastic bag the rest of the body with a message signed by The Incorrigible.
On the 17th, wrapped in blankets, two women were found dead in the town of Zoquiapan in the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the following morning the body of a man was located in Huixquilucan who was wrapped in a yellow blanket with blue, allegedly identified with the name of Mario R<0xC3><0xAD>os according to a message that his executors left next to him.
In Ixtapaluca, with gunshots to the back of the head, the lifeless body of a woman was found in the town of San Francisco Acuautla.
On the woman’s skin, Santa Muerte tattoos were detected, as well as necklaces with her image.
In the last part of the month, the body of a man was found on board a car in the municipality of Zinacantepec with at least three bullet impacts and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of a pair of men with their heads taped and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies was a message allegedly signed by a criminal organization that said, “This happens to those who don’t line up.”
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and tied hands and feet, two bodies were found inside an abandoned taxi behind the Justice Center of the San Agust<0xC3><0xAD>n colony.
On the last day of the month the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz, and Nezahualc<0xC3><0xB3>yotl.
The first was decapitated in the Cuchilla Anc<0xC3><0xB3>n colony and was wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with cinnamon ribbon and next to a message; while the second was tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Next to him the agents found a card with a message.
China maintains targets to reduce greenhouse gases
The representative of that country at COP16 said that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and detailed that it supports its offer to reduce by 2020 between 40 and 45 percent its greenhouse gas emissions.
China maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, said Su Wei, the country’s representative at COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei said that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and to reconvert its industry.
In fact, he said, in the last four years his country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, he made it clear that China will not change its objectives, but will continue to work together with the international community on this matter.
China’s climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity building; institution building; and support for pilot programs.
In all these areas, progress has been made, including the approval, last year, of a new Energy Law, which includes the objectives set in terms of reducing gas emissions, he explained.
In China, federal authorities have been working in coordination with state and local authorities to achieve the goals of energy saving, efficient energy use and emission reduction.
In addition, several multi-year plans, both financed by the Chinese government and by governments of other countries, are underway or have already been concluded.
For example, he said, the Energy Efficiency Program, which was implemented during the last five years and received investments from the United Nations (UN), the government and the private sector.
A provincial climate change project is also underway, another for the change of incandescent bulbs by savers and another for mitigation and adaptation, he said.
At the same table, Martin Krol, scientific adviser to the government of that country on climate change, said that China's efforts have been greater than generally thought.
For example, per capita greenhouse gas emissions in China are six tons per person, while in the United States they are 100 tons; China is responsible for 9 percent of the historical contribution to pollution.
It has also made unprecedented efforts in energy use, such as increasing energy efficiency by 20 percent in the last five years and plans to do the same by 2020, he said.
Attached to the legality expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN explained that the former PAN leader is in his right to go to the Commission of National Order to claim what is appropriate to his right.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was attached to the legality and that the former PAN leader is in his right to go to the Commission of National Order to claim what suits his right.
In an interview before the protest of Gabino Cué Monteagudo as governor of the state, he said that in any case the expulsion of Espino is a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Commission of Order of Sonora."
"Mr. Espino has his right to go, if necessary, via complaint to the Commission of Order of the National Council, in such a way that it is a decision taken within the scope of a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he clarified that it is not time to think about 2012 and that an alliance for the presidential candidacy was never at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez said he was convinced that Acci<0xC3><0xB3>n Nacional will be strengthened by the internal election on December 4 and 5, in which his successor will be elected.
“That (a 2012 alliance) is an issue that was never on the negotiating table, at least not for now, it was an approach to the local election that was successful and fulfilled the goal,” he said.
The PAN leader said that the PAN is backed by 71 years of dialogue, so "we are not afraid of internal competition; on the other hand, "we enjoy it and we are strengthened," he said.
He said that no doubt the council will know how to choose the best or the best leader that requires National Action for the next three years, hence it will deliver the relay "to whom the council determines."
"I have that absolute tranquility and openness, to any of the five I would be proud to hand over the office of the party president."
He predicted that the upturn registered by the party in the last elections of July 4 will be reflected in the next contests, although "it is not yet time to think about 2012. "
"For now it is about accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments emanating from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a cause for observation throughout the country, hence "many hopes, longings are placed in them, and I am sure that Gabino will be up to expectations."
When asked about the PRI’s criticism of President Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n for his speech in the framework of the four years of his government, César Nava called on PRI members to reflect on the six-year terms of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
“If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, let them start defending them, let them come out of the closet,” he said.
He opined that the head of the Federal Executive can make expressions like those he made in his speech at the National Auditorium, because in the country there is no gag, much less censorship.
Obama Promotes Law on Twitter in Favor of Undocumented Students
“If you agree that passing the Dream Act is appropriate, call your senators and urge them to pass this legislation,” the president tweeted.
President Barack Obama today joined the national mobilization in support of the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message on his personal Twitter account.
“If you agree that passing the Dream Act is appropriate, call your senators and urge them to pass this legislation,” Obama tweeted.
His brief message keeps open a cyber link to a broader document that asks the public to immediately communicate with senators, given that the vote on the legislation is imminent.
“With a vote expected to happen soon, now is the time to make your voice heard,” he said.
The message was released after all 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote on any legislation unless the extension of Bush-era tax cuts and government funding is approved.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned by the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs trusted that once the fiscal issue is resolved, a timetable can be set for the rest of the projects.
"I think there's a lot of time..."
"We all agree that we have to resolve the tax issue before the end of the year..."
“I think we can get an agreement at some point on that and then we can plan the sequence of the rest,” he said.
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid announced Tuesday that he would call for a “debate-closing vote” on the Dream Act, so the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on starting next Thursday in the Senate, although it is more likely next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act would legalize about 800,000 young people who entered the United States before the age of 16, have stayed in the country for the past five years, and entered an institution of higher education or the military.
But supporters require 60 votes to pass the bill, requiring the help of a handful of Republicans, at a time when pro-project organizations are lobbying intensely to ensure the passage of the bill.
Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
Yet at least one of them, Sen. Ben Nelson of Nebraska, has said he will vote against it, and only one Republican has voiced support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
Therefore, supporters of the Dream Act require adding several Republicans in case other Democrats decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most wooed Republicans are Maine Senators Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as outgoing Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed Senator Mel Martinez’s term.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past include Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but have said they will not support it again.
Another Republican he supported, John McCain, has not defined his position at this time.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the biggest hurdles in the Senate.
With literature they put their finger on the sore
The second round of The Pleasures of the Tongue was a walk where the participants celebrated the narration
"Sex in the language I understand it but... the finger in the sore? what is expected of me?", inquired the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second round of The pleasures of the language, cycle that celebrates literature in Spanish and this time used the subtitle of his question (in another fair the round table was dedicated to Sex in the language).
The finger in the sore ... "puts us in trouble", gently spewed the Argentine writer to the public, mostly young people, who gathered at the Guadalajara International Book Fair (FIL) to listen to this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz and where Valenzuela, Sergio Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez, Mayra Montero and Luis Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio and that Shultz would later define as a great story, with Luisa in the first person as the protagonist who seeks to know what the "sore" is, goes from doctor to doctor, from which she does not get answers although clues in the same narrative thread.
From the infectologist she is convinced: "patience is not my forte, perhaps it is my wound".
In the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who has stolen his breath in the middle of the corridor, but who clarifies that the wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the wound is the real open, the symbolic is the scar".
The protagonist sighed relieved and concluded "from the wound I only managed to know that it is the real open and that it does not exist", but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the language must go very far.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez also exposed a delightful narration that entitled Praise of Invention, where the finger in the wound is not named but in a moment it is discovered.
With brushstrokes of magical realism, it tells of a famous sorceress, who also touched clouds, brought back men who had gone far or repaired the virtues that a maiden had lost, a narrative that turned to speak later America, the great novel that did not lack from the beginning its own chroniclers who told it and quoted Bernal D<0xC3><0xAD>az del Castillo who criticizes the excesses of it with.
"Cernatives who invented us all (the writers) made a mockery of the pretended witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but otherwise the story of America would never have been told with imagination that was lacking to the point of modesty."
However, he stressed "it is the fools and the deceivers who best imagine" and it is where reality and lies converge, where it is no longer known that what is narrated belongs to one side or the other, where fiction literature reaches its peak.
In fact, he calls it the "Cervantine tradition".
“By His inheritance we are what is counted.”
In her turn, the writer Mayra Montero limited and applauded the variety of interpretations to which the invitation of the FIL gave rise with its round table The finger in the wound.
The Cuban-Puerto Rican pointed hers towards the great wound of social violence that crosses her country -and shares Latin America- product of the disputes of drug trafficking and sale.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit commitment that of course is not premeditated," he said, after citing that the reality of literature is communication and the dimension of the commitment that is established between author and readers, and that in a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The night was closed by the Spanish poet Luis Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a Montero whose intervention also emphasized "that finger in the wound of the committed writer of the writer".
He considered that in a world that lives in a hurry, also in intellectual customs and control of consciences that results in dogmatisms, forgetting "that behind every affirmation there is a small no and behind every denial there is a small yes".
"To be masters of our thinking and to be masters of reality we have to nuance: and nuance means many times to put the finger on the wound and to annoy those people who are much more comfortable thinking in caricature, in black and white, in established ideas and without nuance and to annoy also the powers that prefer a world in black and white," he said, inviting to recover the sense of writing.
Romano goes for his first title
Ruben Omar Romano has three defeats in the finals, has had ups and downs in his career, but has already managed to reach the decisive series on three occasions.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, they also face two different styles marked by their technicians, who find each other with a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the finals, he has had ups and downs in his career, but he has already reached the decisive series on three occasions, although so far he has gone blank and that is why this occasion is very special for him.
The Argentine has ended up consoling himself with the medal of the runner-up, has fallen one step behind the winners and curiously with the same team has played consecutive finals.
The Santos strategist reached his first final as a coach in the 2002 Apertura Tournament, when he was in charge of Morelia with which he fell 4-2 overall against Toluca; later, in the 2003 Clausura he also reached the decisive duel and also lost it with a 3-1 overall and it was precisely against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna, in the 2010 Bicentennial Tournament, again against the Diablos, Rubén suffered a setback, since his team ended up tied 2-2 against the choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the penalty shootout he took a 3-1 lead with two chances to seal the title for finally three players of hiss failed from the 11 steps and suffered the 4-3 turnaround.
Ruben has already lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his rival in turn, therefore he does not want to run the same fate, seeks to get rid of the curse and be able to celebrate for the first time a title, although he says that for him the most important thing is the institution.
"I want to be champion, I don't want to break any statistics, this is for a club, for a hobby to which I owe myself and consequently the title will come for me, but the above is the most important thing," said the helmsman when questioned about the numbers he has against playing finals.
Very current has the previous final, which, he says, has learned a lot, "the only lesson we can have is that until the referee whistles the end we can not celebrate, we are prepared in the line, the players too, because the previous time, with two penalties for shooting we were ready to run and I think that's a lesson, until the game is over we can celebrate."
Knowing that this series could be defined in penalty shots, something that does not worry him, because he trusts his players: "One never seeks to reach the penalty shootout, one seeks to finish in regular time, but sometimes there is no other and we have to be prepared, in the previous tournament we were prepared, unfortunately we made a bad move the fate came, sometimes because of nerves or anxiety to have the title in our hands, but we have to be prepared."
Romano has it in his hands to stop being a technical runner-up and try for the first time the glory given by the titles.
US changes rules to get visa
Individuals must go to the Visa Applicant Service Centers prior to their interview at the Consular Section; the cost will be lower and so will the waiting time.
As of January 10, 2011, the procedure for processing a visa at the U.S. Embassy and Consulates will change.
Under the new procedure, most applicants will need to go to the Visa Applicant Service Centers (ASC) prior to their interview at the Consular Section.
ASC staff will take the applicant’s biometric information, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages for applicants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, it will no longer be necessary to make a payment to make the appointment, another payment to process the visa application and another one for the courier to deliver the document.
The applicant will only make a single payment that will cover all three services.
The current fee will remain unchanged: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for on-demand visas (including temporary worker visas) and $390 for merchant and investor visas.
People who wish to renew their visa will not have to go to an interview with the Consular Officer, but will only go to the nearest ASC where they will present their documents and take their fingerprints.
Because biometric information will be taken at the ASC, applicants who require a second appointment to be interviewed at the Consular Section will remain in the Consular Section less time than in the past.
Likewise, those who apply for a visa at the Consulates in Ciudad Juarez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra $26 service fee.

NASA to announce discovery of alien life
The US space agency has summoned the press to present tomorrow a finding that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will release tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery, which could prove the theory that extraterrestrial life does exist.
The finding will be presented at a press conference Thursday at 1:00 p.m. at NASA Headquarters in Washington by experts in astrobiology, a science described as studying the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
Citing the press, NASA said it will present "a finding that will have an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life," prompting speculation from experts in other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that there are creatures on our side and in hostile environments that were thought uninhabitable, and would put on the table the possibility that they become intelligent beings like humans if they improve the conditions in which they live.
It appears to be a microbe that was found at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was thought too poisonous for any life form, as the lake is rich in arsenic.
Somehow, the creature uses arsenic as a way to survive and from this ability increases the possibility that similar life could exist on other planets, which do not have our benevolent atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be shown that "there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from the one we know".
The space agency will unveil the true scope of the findings at Thursday's press conference.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (the largest moon of Saturn), under the perspective that its chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergence and oppositional 'block' pattern
With reforms to the Organic Law of the Congress, it gives rise to the arrival of 'bipartisanship', they denounce.
The 60 Legislature was not installed when an opposition bloc emerged in Congress, led by the deputies of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Manuel Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n Montalvo, who declared himself independent, and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of 'bipartisanship' to the House.
Before starting the installation session of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, of Convergence; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of the PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of the PRD; and Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n Montalvo, 'throned' against the reform of the Organic Law, since it excluded them.
With this reform, they reiterated, it starts the 'bipartisanship', because now it will be two people, of equal number of parties, who will control the Congress.
These four deputies, along with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Board of Directors, headed by the Panista Salvador L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, in his capacity as vice president.
Corvera Quevedo, detailed that these reforms institutionally constitute the political marginality of the PRI and PAN.
He explained that in the coming days they will talk with the representatives of the PAN and PRI to modify the scheme, starting from a political will, and if they do not have it, then they will be overwhelmed again by both parties and with that the opposition coalition is finished.
"So far it has come (the opposition coalition), it is what I look at, because we are excluded, from any decision, they do not even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, from Convergencia, mentioned that with the PRD, PT and Patron, there are coincidences and that is why they are forming a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that Congress, after having been monopolistic, should now be “duopolic.”
“It is not the spirit of reform to the law that there is an eternal bipatidism in Congress.”
To begin with, this group is starting with 5 legislators, and they are talking with other colleagues to make them more, the convergent abounded.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of the PT, explained that currently the Congress has become a 'booty' between two, in allusion to the PAN and PRI.
“It used to be just one game, now they’re splitting it between two.”
Patron Montalvo, asked to respect the personality of the deputy, to give him his place at the negotiating tables.
"That not by cupular agreements, leave out 5 that we will probably make 9 deputies, right now the five who see us, separated into different fractions, we have decided to unify to seek a place at the negotiating table, that is the issue in the reform that they did that they agreed, we are outside and we do not agree with that reform."
$200,000 more for "the supplier"
Mazatlan City Council pays another check to the questioned owner of an electrical equipment company.
A check for just over 200,000 pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Council.
With this, the amount that has been paid in this second half to the owner of the electrical equipment company, amounts to 1.2 million pesos.
According to the transparency page of the Municipality, this last check number 9258447 was issued on November 16, for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, under the concept of "settlement of accounts payable".
The Treasurer Luis Miguel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Moreno had advanced that more money would come out of the Commune in favor of this supplier, which was observed by the Superior Audit of the State for selling at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total still owed to him and, consequently, how many more checks remain to be issued in favor of Camacho Palazuelos.
“You haven’t bought anything, you’re just being paid what you owe, just like the rest of the suppliers,” he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, two of October 15, October 19, October 29 and the latter, of November 16.
Although the provider has not yet been published in the Official State Gazette, as indicated by the Law when a company is questioned by the ASE, in order to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasurer assured that they have not used their services again.
The above, after that on July 25, Northwest published a review of the checks issued by the City Council to its suppliers, in which it was revealed that, from March 2008 to July 9, 2010, in the triennium of Mayor Jorge Abel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Sánchez, Camacho Palazuelos paid the Municipality more than 10 million pesos, through 42 checks.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, where he cashed checks for more than 3 million pesos.
Urgent attention to tourist sites
Tourist businessmen lament the accident of the foreign tourist due to bad conditions of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlan.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a sinking of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourism sector of Mazatlan asked the authorities to pay attention to the areas and sites that are in poor condition and that project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Merchants of the Golden Zone, recalled that on different occasions they have denounced that the image of the destination is taken care of and reverse the bad that tourists find with new activities or routes.
He said the poor state of the streets and sidewalks has affected because tourists come for a walk and see the mess and turn around nearby businesses.
"Politicians do not know what it is to close a company one day and have no idea of the money that is lost, or else they would not do the works in this way in such a long time and without proper planning."
The hotelier José Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance by the City Council.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and prevent it from happening again, how to do it because giving preventive maintenance and not only fall into the corrective," he said.
“We are eager to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area must be maintained, but as inhabitants we deserve a clean place to live and the City Council must change its strategy to maintain the city well.”
There are other sites that also look sloppy and incomplete, he said, such as the Escudo and Venadito de Mazatlan.
"Today, for the tourist to come, it does not depend only on the promotion, there has to be a good product, a city that has cleanliness on its beaches, in its avenues, permanent maintenance in what are the tourist attractions," he said.
"There has not been due attention and this type of fact highlights something that is notorious for everyone, maintenance is needed."
Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Llera Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez, undersecretary of Tourism Promotion, said that the rescue of tourist sites in Mazatlan is urgent, because they are not exploited correctly and project a bad image.
He talked about a series of places that should be put in line with the municipality and be a priority to have the city up to date, clean, orderly and that is attractive because it is touristy.
“Fortunately Mazatlan offers many historical and cultural sites and places that will have to be ordered first, cleaned and put in line to make them attractive so that we can add them to the inventory we have to promote the destination.”
Request IP results to Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, president of the CCE, proposed that the deputies assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing for a better Sinaloa for the various challenges it faces.
A Legislature of decent work and free of agreements between parties and the state executive demands the business sector of Mazatlan, because there is a convulsed Sinaloa that faces great problems.
Since yesterday, the 60th legislature was installed, composed of seven political forces, 19 PRI deputies, 13 from the PAN, three from the New Alliance Party, two from the PRD, one from the PT, one from Convergence and one more from the PVEM, which adds a total of 40 popular representatives.
Among the list of expectations of the new members of the State Congress is that they come to carry out a clean management and commitment to society and to the different sectors that require responsible legislative work and that the same patterns of partisanship or paternalism are not repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, president of the Business Coordinating Council, proposed that the newly inaugurated 40 deputies of the State Congress assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing for a better Sinaloa for the various challenges it faces.
"We hope that the deputies really exercise their right, free of agreements between the parties because it is customary that they make arrangements to look after their own interests and become carnival comparsas of the rulers and the leaders of the parliamentary fractions."
That is why he spoke of certifying the commitment to establish the necessary bridges that take forward the Governor in turn.
"We occupy that they come to do a decent job and above all committed to society and the sectors because it was the Sinaloans who gave them the vote of confidence in the last elections."
José Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Manguart Sánchez, president of the Three Islands Hotels Association, considered that one of the great challenges of the 40 popular representatives is to push and join forces in search of the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is very complicated.
“The most important thing is that they push economic growth, that they generate incentives for investment and infrastructure and that will somehow encourage job creation.”
As for tourism activity, he demanded that the new legislators give him the weight he has within the state budget to strengthen the State Secretary of Tourism.
“I understand that it is the second Secretariat in the state with the lowest budget and is incongruous as an important economic activity and generator of foreign exchange and investment and that it directly competes with agro-industry.”
In addition, it is necessary to label resources to detonating tourism projects and that help in giving security to the state and in the update to the Alcohol Law that they have not been able to solve in previous legislatures.
We are looking for a Magic King.
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the longing of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For his parents, the next Kings Day will be difficult to please their illusions, since their home is made up of nothing more and nothing less than 12 people and a goat.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s, José Alfredo, Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Guadalupe, Isa<0xC3><0xAD>as, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchor, Gaspar and Baltazar will give them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a humble house in the Salvador Allende Colony and lives daily because the father does not have a permanent job.
"Well, sometimes we see it hard because my husband has no room, but we sell mandarin and potato ... already in the afternoon I go out with the 'plebes' to sell on the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, mother of the little ones.
Adelaide, 4, wants a doll or a bike, while her sister Isabel, 3, would like a Barbie doll.
For his part, 10-year-old José Alfredo has long aspired to have a monster car and for his little brother Jesus, 8 months old, Cayetana suggests size clothes for a year.
"He said to me (Jose Alfredo), 'I would like this monster', but I said 'let's go see son', because it was very expensive," Cayetana recalled sadly.
For older children, who were at school, clothing and footwear would be ideal.
Maria Guadalupe, 11, is size 12; Isaiah, 10, is size 10, while Miguel, 8, wears size eight.
14-year-old Jose Juan is lacking in tennis, so a pair of size five and a half or six would be very helpful.
If you want to help make the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family come true, you can participate in the Look for a Magic King campaign by donating a toy or cash at the Northwest Reception.
Fourteen suspected drug traffickers arrested
On Wednesday, in Estrie, a dozen persecutions have been carried out in the framework of the dismantling of a network of production and sale of Cannabis.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The persecutions have occurred in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mainly in the places where the production of the drug was carried out.
"About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, money and equipment destined for production have been seized," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for Quebec Security.
In total, eleven men and three women have been arrested, including the two alleged leaders of the network, two men from Sherbrooke.
The detainees had to appear at the Sherbrooke courthouse in the hours following their arrest.
They could face accusations of cannabis production, possession for the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These persecutions have occurred after a long investigation that has lasted about a year.
“It was the information provided by the public that allowed us to make the arrests,” Ruel said.
This police operation involved around seventy officers from the Quebec Security Estrie investigation module, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Department.
Illegal migration can be tackled without problems
The Conservatives’ bill, which the government says should solve the problem of stooges laden with illegal migrants, is likely to face stiff opposition as the three opposition parties announced Wednesday they could not support it.
"I rely mainly on the Charter."
"I'm here with a party that has created the granite that you stand on," said Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by MPs after the weekly caucus meeting.
The Liberals argue that the bill in its current form, which would allow anyone from a ship identified as carrying illegal immigrants to be detained for up to a year, violates the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
Quebec Bloc leader Gilles Duceppe also said he could not back the bill because it was aimed at the wrong target.
"We are against it and, it seems, all the opposition parties are against the project, so we will see what the government does," Duceppe said.
The NDP’s criticism of immigration, Olivia Chow, has dismissed criticism that her party is not firm enough with illegal immigrants.
“The neo-democrats agree that action should be taken against those in charge of illegal immigrants, and that’s what we want with another bill, the C-35,” Chow said.
“We don’t support the Conservatives’ bill because it attacks refugees and imprisons children for a minimum of one year,” Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney has accused the parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
“The vast majority of Canadians tell MPs that they do not tolerate this kind of clandestine migration, these criminal operations against Canada and that they treat the country like a doormat.”
"They expect Canada to take strong action," said Minister Kenney.
The government has not announced a vote of confidence on its bill, which could lead the country to an election as a result of its rejection.
However, a conservative has told the QMI Agency that the government was going to request a vote so that each deputy who is going to oppose will later explain himself to his voters.
The new unity does not achieve unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a permanent anti-corruption and collusion unit by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the establishment of a public consultation commission on the issue.
The Minister of Public Safety, Robert Dutil, supports that this idea has not been raised two days ago: Quebec would have consulted with the New York Department of Investigation this issue since January last year.
The metropolis has had a permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
As a result, Tuesday’s announcement caught more than one person by surprise.
It should be said that, during a meeting of the Permanent Council on Quebec police services held on October 29, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
That was enough for the critic of the Quebec party that deals with the issue of public safety, Stéphane Bergeron, to describe this announcement as "a rabbit out of the bag" and as "a messy last-minute solution".
Minister Dutil, for his part, has responded to those who fear that political power will have too much influence over possible future unity.
“You’ll see the results when we announce it,” he says simply.
“We are aware of this problem.”
For the president of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, there is nothing that can replace the launch of a public survey.
“The more Mr. Charest persists in avoiding the creation of this commission of inquiry, the more people share our opinion, that is, that he has something to hide,” he explains.
“The only way to have a commission of inquiry is with the resignation of Jean Charest,” explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To get out of this deadlock, he suggests that Quebec give a special mandate to the intervenor general to conduct a survey on collusion and corruption.
“We must be able to extend the mandate of the intervenor general,” he concludes.
It also considers that Quebec could grant the intervener the same powers as a commissioner, thus allowing him to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent crew is not the only project in the making in the Charest Government.
Quebec also requests Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to better accommodate this type of crime.
This request seems to come from the prosecutor of the Marteau operation, who has informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law is not explicit in this type of investigation.
Federal Public Safety Minister Vic Toews has confirmed that his Justice counterpart, Rob Nicholson, is currently leaning towards making certain amendments on this issue.
During the Spring 2001 operation related to biker groups, although the Criminal Code had not been adapted, 131 people were arrested.
Subsequently, Ottawa pushed for the adoption of the Gangsterism Act.
Rivers under extreme surveillance
Several waterways are being closely monitored due to heavy rainfall that has been recorded in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
On Wednesday afternoon there was a landslide in Shawinigan, in Mauricie.
As a preventive measure, two houses have been evacuated.
At night, another landslide occurred at Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re.
A road sank.
From Tuesday to Wednesday night, several regions recorded heavy rainfall, between 40 and 70 millimeters of rain.
An additional 20 to 40 millimetres is also expected from now until Thursday evening, depending on the region.
The sectors north of the river and in the Outaouais valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to a total of 100 millimeters of rain.
Since these precipitations add to the melting of snow that had already accumulated in certain sectors, it is feared that various rivers will overflow.
On Wednesday night, the Quebec Civil Security unit issued alerts for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re.
The rivers of the north, in Saint-Jér<0xC3><0xB4>me, in the Laurentians, and of the Ch<0xC3><0xAA>ne, in Lotbini<0xC3><0xA8>re, have already caused floods in the past and are under surveillance.
In the Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re region, heavy rainfall has caused some lakes to overflow at Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, heavy rains have washed away a temporary bridge.
As a preventive measure, ten residences have been evacuated.
In Outaouais, the overflow of certain lakes has led to the closure of several roads, in particular in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The Civil Security unit remains on alert and is monitoring the situation closely, said Annik Bouchard, security adviser.
The Quebec Flood Forecast Center, for its part, issued Wednesday announcements communicating the strong floods of several rivers, in particular the Maskinongé, the Assomption, the Ouareau, the Achigan, the Batiscan and the Loup.
They partially blame Dupont.
Quebec radio presenter Stéphane Dupont has suffered a certain setback before the Canadian Council on Radio and Television Standards (CCNR) over controversial statements regarding social assistance and about Haitians, as well as for his rude language on the radio.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team had the right to express their opinion, but certain statements contained “inaccurate information about social assistance, an unduly negative representation of Haitians, and rude language that should not be used in broadcasts broadcast during the day.”
The Council has also indicated that discussions on suicide, including the release of the names of two persons who had committed suicide, do not violate the broadcasting codes.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding comments made on broadcasts broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was issued following a complaint by the Common Front of People on Social Assistance of Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts mentioned in the issue were not correct.
Presenters should communicate reliable data and not lead to deception.
In relation to suicide, the presenter Stéphane Dupont had stated that suicide was an act of cowardice.
Most members of the Committee had concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life's problems.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the disputed episodes of 'Dupont le midi' have dealt with a sensitive issue in an equitable and appropriate manner."
Therefore, any blame has been cast aside in this regard.
The last dispute concerned the statements made after the earthquake in Haiti.
At that time, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had been the protagonists of a media confrontation that had provoked numerous reactions.
The CHOI presenter stated that he had not made any donations to help Haitians because he could not know for sure if those in need were actually going to receive the money.
The Committee considers that these comments are not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already served my three-day suspension up there."
"My record has been clean for a year and a half," the host said.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the issuance of foul language.
In any case, the radio station CHOI-FM has collaborated "even more than required".
The consequences will be minimal for the broadcaster, which must, among other things, announce the decisions once in the hours of greatest audience within three days.
A King of Kung Fu in Montreal
The Montrealese of Algerian origin Nacereddine Zemmal has had an extremely peculiar journey.
The athlete, who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and Thai boxing, climbs the tatami mats and rings of the world in search of new challenges.
“I started practicing martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria,” explained Zemmal, who has lived in the metropolis since 2008 to advance at the professional level.
“In my case, I look for combat everywhere because, for those who don’t enjoy the above-ground play that mixed martial arts involve, there are few competitions in North America.”
The athlete, who works as a security agent and as an employee of the UPS company, has recently given bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) Amateur World Championship, held from October 23 to 30 in Edinburgh, Scotland.
“I won in the full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing categories,” he explained.
"I am currently preparing to participate in the San Shou World Cup in China."
“They will invite athletes who have finished in the top four in the last world championship in each category.”
"In 2009, I won the bronze medal in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished in eighth place."
"In 2007, in China, I finished the tournament in fifth place, but I reached third place in Toronto in 2009," he added.
“The interesting thing is that I’ve been making progress in every competition.”
"At this rate, I'll be the first this time or next year!"
San shou or "sanda" is a discipline originating in China in which it is allowed to strike with the fists and feet, as well as to throw opponents to the ground.
Clashes are originally held on a platform and, less frequently, in a ring.
The most famous boxer in this type of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, widely recognized in the world of martial arts.
Although Nacer Zemmal must only hold one competition in his career, he will certainly attend the great "King of Sanda" tournament, the Super Bowl of kung-fu.
"This competition is the most notorious and prestigious in China," explains the friendly boy.
“It’s like the equivalent of Lumpinee Stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand).”
“It has been an incredible experience.”
Zemmal won his first match, in the semifinals of his category (80 kg), but lost in the final.
“The one who won me is a true professional,” he says.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals face off in the final of their category."
“Then, the champions of each category face off to crown a single champion, the king of kung fu.”
450 million in contracts without tenders
Hydro-Québec has awarded direct contracts worth $450 million to engineering companies for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this flood of more than a hundred contracts is a consortium formed by the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has obtained without a previous tender the most important contract, that of project management, for a sum of 295 million.
The consortium, called <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance, was created in 2004 following Hydro-Québec’s decision to entrust the private sector with its responsibility for managing this important $5 billion hydroelectric project.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance obtained the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For the Quebec Party, the use of consortiums of companies poses a serious ethical problem that threatens to eliminate competition and cause a rise in prices.
“This is a new method of collusion and eliminating competition.”
“In other words, the people, instead of doing it in secret, now do it openly,” Quebec Party lawmaker Sylvain Simard told a news conference.
Earlier in the morning, Mr Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because, he claims, he does not understand how the public interest can be benefited in this way.
Natural Resources Minister Nathalie Normandeau responded in the afternoon, strongly denying collusion with this contract.
"I'm starting to get tired," he protested, arguing that the PQ had acted "dishonestly" and "with a lack of rigor".
He said the "least" would be for the PQ to apologize.
The consortium formula is a common practice all over the world.
Normally, this is an alliance with a time limit that allows two or more companies to group their knowledge to respond to a tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project presents a high level of complexity, taking into account the magnitude of the works.
The works have already begun and will last until 2012.
In any event, the contract was awarded without competition; it was a negotiation.
In addition, the consortium formula has ceased to be the exception to the norm in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir published last week, the formula of consortia in the field of technical advice is being investigated by the Government.
A quick look at Quebec’s trade register allows you to identify more than 200 consortia, some of which seem permanent.
In this way, the Dessau company works in partnership with most of its main competitors, such as CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin, Roche et Tecsult, and others.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to a single legal entity, i.e. Dessau.
With regard to the <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the James Bay territory responds to a particular workforce dynamic and Hydro-Québec has been responding specifically to it since the 1970s."
The great head of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has given an explanation that has highlighted the fact that the project management contract has been awarded directly.
“If you respond to a tender and there are few participants, your prices are going to be higher.”
"You have two options: you can get in touch with the players in the sector and tell them: we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement and with a good price."
"However, the idea is that what matters is not the price, but the competition of the people," said Mr. Laporte.
The contract awarded to the <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance consortium is part of a long list of contracts worth more than $50,000 obtained by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir has identified 109 technical advisory contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to companies or their subsidiaries, in particular geotechnical laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has obtained 22 contracts, Génivar has obtained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without taking into account its participation in <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance.
All contracts were negotiated.
In total, they amount to $449,783,344, including the <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance contract of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard has implied that the four companies that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "good acquaintances of the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau has hinted that the PQ is also linked to these companies, which "finance" it, before specifying that it is rather their leaders.
Barometer of responsible consumption. The label "green" does not inspire confidence
Greener, but deeply skeptical.
The Quebec consumer hardly trusts the actors of sustainable development, as well as fair trade brands or ecological certificates to guide their choices.
According to the Barometer of responsible consumption, whose first results have been published yesterday, the situation is even worse. The consumer is immersed in a media universe where messages are swarming that defend more responsible consumption, but regrets the lack of reliable information and considers that it even curbs their commitment.
Even if consumption of so-called “socially responsible” products has increased in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two thirds of them say, in fact, that they do not trust the environmental commitment of companies or the environmental advertising of them, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Observatory of responsible consumption of the University of Sherbrooke.
Another conclusion: half of consumers question the reliability of the official certificates that bear the so-called fair products, as well as the credibility of the products and brands that bear labels indicating that they are "eco-responsible", notes the Barometer.
Similarly, only 14.6% of Quebecers take politicians’ speeches on this issue seriously.
In any case, information on responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this sector of consumption, currently supported by about a third of Quebec consumers.
In fact, gaps and the dubious nature of the information mean that 46% of consumers reject this option.
This is the second obstacle identified by the Barometer, after the higher price of these products.
In addition, a third of Quebecers say they also distrust the alleged returns of ecological products or services they are trying to sell.
On the other hand, almost half of consumers changed their habits in 2010 and, especially, changed the brand of one or several products to respect their convictions.
61% have prioritized shopping in their neighborhood stores and have preferred to buy food products grown in their region, says the Barometer.
Greener and more responsible (the rate of responsible consumption has reached 64 points out of a maximum of one hundred this year), Homo consumus from Quebec loves to take the place of the king of recycling who tries to reduce his impact on the environment by worrying about the protection of wildlife.
However, according to the Barometer, that social awareness seems to be from outside: in 2010, only 28% of Quebecers indicated that they have used public transport or have shared a car to defend their environmental principles.
In addition, 39.1% of the participants in this extensive behavioural survey, which has just completed its first edition, support cycling and walking.
A loan for the State to recover eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which has been asked to commit itself financially to the recovery of the eXcentris cinema complex by the Société Angus and the Parall<0xC3><0xA8>le, agrees to collaborate, but only through a loan.
The Société de développement Angus and the Parall<0xC3><0xA8>le, which were waiting for a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to buy back from Daniel Langlois the eXcentris film complex on Boulevard Saint-Laurent and return him to his true cinephile vocation, have not obtained what they were asking for.
The Government has agreed to become involved in the matter, but on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan whose amount would, in fact, be lower than initial expectations; this could constitute a viable solution on advantageous terms, at least in the opinion of certain public employees.
Quebec had already rejected last spring a first action plan and a request for 12.8 million, but since then the requests have been revised downwards.
The president of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Macerola, who leads the eXcentris file, submitted a proposal and an action plan to Minister St-Pierre.
He sent you a final report about ten days ago.
However, SODEC received a counter-proposal from the cabinet on Tuesday.
The Parallel and Angus have until December 31 to respond to it.
In any case, it seems that the hypothesis of a State donation should be completely discarded.
Recall that the Association of owners of cinemas and cinema complexes of Quebec opposed a direct investment of the State to support the recovery of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture should not finance real estate projects, since it has not done so with other cinemas.
On the other hand, several representatives of the sector do call for considerable economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, the owner, has for ten years carried the burden of auteur cinema on its premises of the complex, after financing its own construction, which could justify a repeal by the Treasury Council.
The lack of rooms for independent films is evident in Montreal and eXcentris had managed to retain its clientele.
Angus and Parall<0xC3><0xA8>le, led by Christian Yaccarini, are pushing for a private financing campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to pave the way for the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one of these rooms, the Parall<0xC3><0xA8>le, continues to screen films in eXcentris.
The objective of the future buyers is to reopen the three rooms on February 27, screening the beautiful film by Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des dieux".
However, Christian Yaccarini has not contacted Le Devoir again and we do not know what he and his group think of the downward proposals they have received.
The veil of complex Canada is lifted...
The new U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks reveal what the U.S. sees as the complex of Canadians vis-<0xC3><0xA0>-vis Americans, but at the same time reflect the latter’s sense of superiority towards Canada.
U.S. diplomats are surprised that Canadian voters don’t think about Canada-U.S. relations when they go to vote and believe that President Obama’s visit has helped the Conservative government get its budget approved in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington that were made public yesterday, offer rather juicy details than really substantial content.
A cable dated 22 September 2008, that is, during the full federal election campaign, describes the extent to which the United States does not enter into the issues debated by political leaders.
This caused great surprise to the American ambassador sent to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offers some explanations for this situation.
“Perhaps political leaders are conditioned by an inferiority complex virtually inherent to Canadians in dealing with everyday domestic issues, rather than leaving such a choice to the United States (as during the 1988 free trade campaign),” he writes.
Accordingly, he concludes, the United States is “the proverbial elephant in this election: ubiquitous, but potentially too dangerous to talk about.”
The ambassador has even more trouble understanding this “deafening silence” because the two countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
"Logically, he believes, the ability of a candidate, a party and, even more, a party leader to manage these essential relationships should be a key factor that voters should think about when voting."
This feeling of importance can also be observed in the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, chargé d’affaires in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
“His trip will help ensure the government’s survival during the vote of confidence in early February on the federal budget, through which Canada will record deficit for the first time in the last decade due to a recovery plan of between 30 and 40 billion dollars,” writes Mr. Breese.
Nowhere does it mention that the government had to prorogue Parliament before Christmas to prevent it from being replaced by the coalition or that opposition parties conditioned its survival on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another communication from January 2008 signed by Ambassador Wilkins alerts Washington to the increasingly negative image conveyed by the dramatic series broadcast on the CBC in the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about the broadcasts of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, which make unsubtle references to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or even kidnappings for the CIA to conduct vigorous interrogations.
Another cable recounts that, during her first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe would be willing to take in some Guantanamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner replied that he did, but that it depended "on each case."
At the end of the meeting, they wrote, “has handed over a document to the Secretary of State regarding Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin.”
"The Secretary agreed to review the file."
Finally, we can mention that the moods have warmed in relation to the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser close to Stephen Harper, told CBC radio that whoever was responsible for the mass escape should be “murdered.”
In the United States, Mike Huckabee is mentioned.
A Global Plan to Renew Lighting
Yesterday, the UN has proposed in Cancun a plan to renew domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in a hundred countries to reduce greenhouse gases (GHG) by an amount that corresponds to almost a third of the additional decrease that must be carried out to stabilize the climate of the planet before 2020.
This ambitious plan is part of the set of concrete major projects that the UN hopes will be adopted in Cancun to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments in the industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if incandescent bulbs, which still monopolize between 50 and 70% of the market, were replaced by fluocompact bulbs or, even better, by light-emitting diode (LED) bulbs, much of the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of GHG emitted on the planet to illuminate humans would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
It is equivalent to 70% of the emissions of the global car fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, large emitting countries such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans that were to reduce global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, 5 Gt of this amount should still be decreased to stabilize, before 2020, the increase in temperatures by two degrees Celsius to prevent it from getting out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy is dissipated in the form of heat and the rest, that is, 5%, produces light.
In the case of compact fluorescent bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, energy consumption is further reduced by two times.
Fluorocompact bulbs last an average of between 6,000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those launched by the manufacturer Philips this week (a company that has also participated in the UN study), have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, which allows us to get an idea of the savings that can be achieved with the replacement plan that would be applied in a hundred countries.
These new bulbs can also work with rheostats and emit very little heat.
Above all, they do not contain any mercury.
A number of specialists have expressed reservations about compact fluorescent bulbs, since they contain mercury and should be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries unless manufacturers provide instructions.
However, the main source of mercury emission on the planet is not fluo-compact bulbs, but coal-fired power plants, which emit a large amount of mercury to produce the electricity that is wasted with incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report details the advantages that this international programme would offer to each country.
For example, Indonesia would save a billion dollars a year in electricity and eight million tons of CO2, the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants, the construction of which would cost it $2.5 billion.
C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire eagerly awaits the announcement of the election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the "immediate" publication of the results of the presidential elections in C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire, given that the deadlines have expired.
“The Secretary-General underscores the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and announce provisional results immediately,” a UN spokesman said.
“It calls on all parties in C<0xC3><0xB4>te d’Ivoire and institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative until provisional results are announced.”
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the electoral commission has allowed Wednesday’s midnight deadline to pass without the results being published, three days after Sunday’s vote.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the CIS president had told television that the commission was "still working" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, the world has multiplied the requests that the CIS finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo side has the annulment by the Constitutional Council of the "fraudulent" votes in the north, in the hands of the former rebellion of the New Forces (FN) since the failed coup d'état of September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, campaign manager for the Ivory Coast president, said the FN's intimidation of voters in the north of the country had deterred supporters of the outgoing president from voting.
The entire election could be annulled if the Constitutional Council accepts Gbagbo’s complaints.
Gbagbo’s opponents say the country’s highest court is not neutral, as it is headed by Paul Yao N’Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who denies any relationship with the former rebels, has called the delay in publishing the results "unacceptable" and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, but has not gone so far as to claim victory.
His allies claim that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows he has lost and that filing a complaint with the Constitutional Council after having prevented the electoral commission from disseminating the results would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections, on Sunday, should have put the icing on the cake to the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country divided in two for years.
The United Nations warned Ivory Coast's political class on Wednesday that they could be held responsible for possible acts of violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished in the first round, on October 31, with 38% of the vote against 32% of Alassane Ouattara, who publicly received the support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter
According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), the unemployment rate in France has remained stable at 9.3% on the mainland (9.7% taking into account the overseas departments), as indicated by the data corrected with the provisional seasonal variations (CVE) published on Thursday by INSEE.
The number of unemployed remains at 2,631,000 in mainland France.
The data for the second quarter have been confirmed, 9.3% of the working population in the mainland and 9.7% with the DOM.
In one year, the unemployment rate has increased by 0.1 points.
Overall, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France were not working in the third quarter, but want to work, whether or not they are available in the two weeks to work and whether or not they seek employment.
The situation of young people in the labour market has continued to worsen, with a further increase in the unemployment rate to 24.2% in mainland France (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year), 25% including the DOM.
During the third quarter, 637,000 young people between the ages of 15 and 24 were unemployed in the sense of the ILO.
On the other hand, there has been a slight increase in unemployment among the elderly, up to 6.4% in mainland France (+0.2 points in both three months and one year), i.e. 482,000 people over 50, a figure that amounts to 6.6% with the DOM.
Only stable unemployment among people aged 25 to 49 has been recorded, with 8.3% in mainland France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% in all of France.
Insee has not published the monthly unemployment rate since 2006, after a controversy over its calculation methods.
Eurostat, the European Union’s statistics agency, continues to do so and has announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (DOM included) in October, after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini investigated and detained
Alexandre Guérini, 53, a waste treatment company manager and brother of the PS president of the General Council of Bouches-du-Rh<0xC3><0xB4>ne, is being investigated and has been jailed in Luynes prison near Aix-en-Provence as part of an investigation into allegedly fraudulent public contracts.
Alexandre Guérini is being investigated for abuse of social assets, embezzlement of funds and public goods, cover-up, active corruption, influence peddling and possession of ammunition, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini will fight and answer all the questions posed to him by the magistrate, not ghosts."
"It is easy to persecute him for a multitude of reprehensible acts, it is another thing to demonstrate them," his lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP before the appearance of his client.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the PS leader in the department, Jean-No<0xC3><0xAB>l Guérini, wanted to transmit through his lawyers to the judge, before his appearance, a document to explain himself.
On Wednesday night they began investigating and also imprisoned one of their close people, Philippe Rapezzi.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, all his client has done is take care of the landfills he has to manage.
As for the allocation of contracts or the destination of funds related to their execution, he knows nothing about it, according to counsel Simon.
In the framework of this file, Daniel Pinna, former director general of the services of the urban agglomeration of Aubagne, is also being investigated for embezzlement and complicity, but he has been released on parole and is prohibited from meeting with the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to explain all the facts that have reproached him."
"The investigating magistrate has taken account of the explanations and has released him," said his lawyer, Yann Arnoux.
On Tuesday night, four other people were questioned and released under judicial control in the case of two of them, according to the deputy prosecutor of the Republic, Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy general manager of the Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM) property, has been charged with “trafficking in influence and passive corruption”.
Two officials of the agglomeration of Aubagne, Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Duval and Christophe Bringuier, have been questioned for "abduction and embezzlement of public goods by a person dedicated to public service" and for "complicity in the embezzlement of public funds", respectively.
Finally, Alexandre Guérini’s partner, Jeannie Peretti, is being investigated for “cover-up of the abuse of social goods.”
Among the people who have confronted Mr Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who was recently imprisoned in a parallel case of fraudulent public contracts affecting Corsica.
Investigators suspect that their societies have serviced to launder the capital of the great banditry.
The investigation is being carried out in the context of a number of court orders initiated against X in April 2009 following the receipt of anonymous communications, of course fraud in the award of public contracts, in particular in the waste sector.
A source close to the investigation points out that the investigations focus especially on the conditions of allocation and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne, as well as from other cities of the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss: The Elysée has exaggerated the mediation of Syria
For more than ten months, between July 2009 and May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French investigator arrested in Iran for “espionage”, has kept the public in France on edge, has alerted diplomacy and has accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the watchful eye of U.S. diplomats.
The US documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal certain unknown aspects of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée has explained its strategy to Americans to the point of giving them advice to manage their own “hostage” crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French officials tried to convince Washington that the young French woman’s release did not come in exchange for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and wanted by US justice for trafficking materials for Iran’s nuclear program.
Finally, they reveal the stark reality of how the French presidency tried to manipulate the media to give the impression that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had played an essential role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
Actually, he didn't do anything.
A diplomatic cable drafted on 12 August 2009 in Paris bears the title "Iran: French comments on how to handle hostage-taking cases".
The Elysee's adviser for strategic affairs, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, talk with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
They advise Americans to do the following to repatriate their own citizens forcibly detained in Iran.
“Make noise,” they say, “continually release” in the media the words “fundamental human rights,” “innocence,” “immediate release.”
All to embarrass the Iranian regime, careful of its image.
“When the Iranians ask you to stop, do it even more frequently.”
Because, once the attempts to negotiate through discreet channels are exhausted, “silence will not solve anything,” the Iranians are “experts in delaying maneuvers.”
Mr. Richier adds that the detention of foreigners is “a common Iranian tactic: the taking of hostages for political blackmail.”
It announces that the release from prison of Clotilde Reiss (which will take place on August 16, the day she will take refuge in the French embassy) "will require the payment to the Iranians of a large amount of money" (230,000 euros reward).
The Elysee anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that “is going to increase.”
The Iranians could “in the near future arrest another of the nearly 1,800 French citizens living in Iran,” he says.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss is released from prison after twelve days, but she is blocked in Iran.
The following information is released: Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition is requested by the United States for illicit trafficking of sensitive electronic material into Iran, has been released in Paris by a judge’s decision.
The U.S. Embassy, as well as numerous observers, doubt this strange coincidence.
For Washington, which is closing in on Iran’s clandestine networks for acquiring material for the nuclear program, the release of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Has France accepted an exchange?
Freeing the Iranian in exchange for the French?
During a new conversation with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier guarantees that this was not the case.
The Elysee, he says, not only "has been greatly surprised by the judge's decision," but has tried to oppose it.
“There have been intense negotiations between the French presidency and the Minister of Justice” (at the time, Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Alliot-Marie), but “the French government cannot overturn the decision,” he said.
Mr Richier also wants to show that Majid Kakavand remains under the "close" surveillance of the French intelligence services.
The Elysee’s adviser dials a phone number, hangs up and then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian “is currently in some buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian embassy.”
During the arrest of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysee spares no effort, uses communiques and organized “leaks” in the media to make believe that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad plays an “important” and “influential” role of “mediator”.
The Americans observe this activity with a certain irony and verify that the manipulation bears fruit, since several press articles transmit the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 mentions "the media 'blitz' of French officials".
What is such "gratitude" to Mr. Assad, the embassy in Paris wonders.
“Despite their praise-filled statements, French officials privately acknowledge that they only have a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done.”
Next, the document deals with the reasons that have led the Elysee to give rise to this fiction.
The great communication effort “is aimed at validating Sarkozy’s policy of openness towards Syria,” he says.
A policy initiated in 2008, which “in the opinion of numerous critical voices in France and abroad, had just been dismissed as premature and undeserved.”
By “exaggerating the Syrian role,” Paris is trying to “show Syria the praise it can reap if it plays a constructive role in the region.”
The goal is also to “sow the seed of discord between Syria and Iran.”
The U.S. Embassy knows this from a good source.
On August 11, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier confided to him: "Of course, we don't know if the Syrians have done anything or not."
“But anyway, we thanked him.”
“At the very least, this should cause confusion among Iranians.”
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her at the <0xC3><0x89>lysée Palace.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for playing an “active role in favor of the liberation of our compatriot.”
As of midnight, young Koreans cannot play online
The South Korean government is set to adopt a so-called “Cinderella” law that will prevent teens from participating in online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials have said.
In December, a bill will be submitted to Parliament to ask online gaming companies to block access to such games after midnight to young people under 16 years of age, according to representatives of the Ministries of Culture and Family.
“A lot of kids play all night long and then find it hard to study at school and lead a normal life during the day.”
“We think this law is necessary to protect your health and your right to sleep,” said Jo Rin, the minister in charge of the bill.
Online games will be available again at six in the morning.
Companies will have one year to prepare for law enforcement, he said.
The government is also considering asking companies to limit the daily access time to these games when the parents of the young people request it, the official added.
In addition, it will make available to those who request free computer programs that allow you to limit the time of connection to the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report on various facts linked to heavy Internet use.
The country is also the undisputed champion of global online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, where it faced 58 other countries.
2018-2022 World Cup: FIFA designates the organizing countries
Amid the storm of suspected corruption, FIFA’s executive committee on Thursday named the host countries of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, a clearly political choice where influence struggles and lobbying can come to take precedence over technical criteria.
One thing is clear, the 2018 edition of the FIFA competition will be held in Europe, the traditional bastion of the discipline (four candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal and the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will be much more exotic, given that the International Federation hopes to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a premiere in the African continent in 2010, or continue with its implementation in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities who were part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch heads of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) attests to the economic and political interests at stake in a World Cup.
Behind-the-scenes transactions, therefore, may last until the last minute.
Moreover, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy among the candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) candidacies have better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not carry much weight for the 22 members of the executive committee when it comes to voting.
The Sunday Times, responsible for the revelations that led to the corruption suspension of two CE members (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have ruined the opportunities of his country, cradle of football, which only hosted the World Cup once, in 1966.
The BBC added fuel to the bonfire on Monday by airing a documentary that has exposed three influential EC members, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Enough to upset FIFA and embarrass English officials, who have engaged in intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron at the helm.
The Head of Government hopes to repeat the coup successfully carried out by his predecessor, Tony Blair, who had succeeded in 2005 for London in organizing the 2012 Olympic Games.
Will this intense activity be enough to restore England's shine to the EC?
It is not clear, since the Spain-Portugal duo also has numerous strengths thanks to its stadiums, already ready, its experience (World Cup of 82 in Spain, JJ.OO in Barcelona in 1992, European Cup in 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
However, the bleak economic and financial prospects of both countries could bring down their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal all they get is to give points to Russia, which has become a major outsider despite the gaps in its candidacy (stadiums, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to travel to Zurich and has denounced "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in a direct reference to the accusations of the English press against the members of the EC.
“They are bringing out their dirty rags, trying to compromise them,” Putin said.
By 2022, the United States, which has the experience of 1994, seems the most logical favorite.
As the world’s leading economic powerhouse and home to FIFA’s main sponsors, the country seems to take advantage of Japan and South Korea, which have separately developed an excellent project.
However, these new candidacies seem premature for two countries that have organized the championship together in 2002.
Another risk: the concession of the 2026 World Cup to China, fervently desired by FIFA, which would cause Asia to run out of possibilities by 2022.
Together with Qatar, which has presented its project based on futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion towards new horizons, but both countries present more risks than certainties.
Australia, as well as Japan and Korea, could also be hurt by the weakness of TV rights paid for (depending on the time difference) by European countries, the backbone of the war for FIFA.
Second term: the test
De Gaulle had really doubted.
Mitterrand had hinted that he doubted.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had not the slightest doubt.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less.
One command in the Elysée leads to another.
Therefore, the current head of state will be a candidate again in 2012.
However, the evidence for this does not match well with the mystery that is often associated with the presidential function.
Therefore, it must always appear that there is doubt.
To one side and to the other.
In 2006, even if they didn’t believe it, Jacques Chirac’s friends claimed that he was not ruling out a third term.
On November 15, in a serious tone, Nicolas Sarkozy indicated that he would make his decision "sometime in the autumn of 2011".
Therefore, the fact that he deals with the deputies of the UMP, on Tuesday night in the Elysee, the possibility of "two mandates" has caused some commotion.
Is this the official announcement of your candidacy?
Not at all.
The president only indicated that the 2008 constitutional reform limited the number of five-year terms to two.
It simply conveyed the facts, not an announcement.
It is not the first time that he talks about the presidential elections, with a playful tone, in meetings of this type.
"In the worst, or best, case, you'll still be spending seven and a half years with me," he said in July 2009.
On another occasion, in May 2010: "Don't think that I don't wonder what will come next."
His statements the day before yesterday do not bring him any closer to the candidacy, nor any less.
Comments are made for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race for candidacy in the PS, on the one hand.
But it is not the fact that Ségol<0xC3><0xA8>ne Royal has come to the fore that leads Nicolas Sarkozy to be sincere.
On the contrary, the fact that his candidacy in 2012 is evident is what leads many people in the PS to demand that the battle be organized earlier than planned.
On the other hand, bad polls.
For the first time, right-wing voters prefer the candidacy of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and in the UMP there is no discussion on the subject," the Prime Minister's environment reacted immediately and prudently.
“If he thinks he can lose, he won’t be a candidate,” Raffarin said.
“He will always think he can win,” Alain Juppé corrects, resigned to the evidence.
Euro: the ECB is forced to maintain its acquisitions of State Letters
The last meeting of the Board of Governors of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should make it possible to specify the modalities of exit from the crisis or, at least, to announce the interruption of a large number of unconventional monetary policy operations that should end at the end of the year.
Because of the European sovereign debt crisis, the Frankfurt Issuing Authority will certainly not be able to afford to be so peremptory if it does not want to risk aggravating a more than complicated situation on European bond markets today.
The political cost would be just as high.
Yesterday, during a press conference, the French Minister of Finance, Christine Lagarde, supported the active role played by the ECB in favour of solving the debt crisis of European states.
He did not want to say whether he thought the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its government bond-buying program.
“I reserve my opinion for my fellow Europeans.”
The day before, in Brussels, during his hearing before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, was no more eloquent as to his intentions, indicating only that the program of buying State Letters on the secondary market "continued" and that "we will see what we decide" during Thursday's meeting.
The only thing that is clear is that the ECB is going to keep its main rate unchanged at 1%, the lowest level in its history since May 2009.
In practice, the ECB’s acquisition of Treasury bonds has doubled last week to nearly €1.35 billion.
In addition, according to the indiscreet market operators, yesterday he would have bought again Irish and Portuguese bonds.
In total, the Eurosystem’s central banks have acquired securities worth €67 billion since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is not the slightest doubt that purchases will continue (see page 29).
Economists also do not foresee any significant changes in course.
Although longer-than-three-month lending operations have already disappeared from the ECB’s arsenal, it still makes unlimited liquidity allocations at beneficial terms and with durations ranging from one week to three months.
Economists expect this device to be extended for a few months today.
"I don't imagine he's going to change his program considerably."
"If not, it would run the risk of provoking new tensions in the short term," says Michael Schubert, an economist at Commerzbank.
“It seems more likely that there will be a gradual exit announced during the first quarter of 2011,” Norbert Br<0xC3><0xA4>ms, an economist at Sal, said in a statement.
- Oppenheim.
In relation to interventions in the public debt market, “the ECB should maintain a purchase volume of these bonds in order for the market to remain stable”, adds Norbert Br<0xC3><0xA4>ms.
Given the importance of European banks’ exposures to euro area sovereign debt markets, the Issuing Authority has no choice but to maintain its market presence.
"It must compensate at any price for the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent a marked rise in the yields paid by the most fragile states," said a major bond manager.
Because, if interest rates are clouded, states will have even more trouble reducing their debt, or even stabilizing it.
This is the price of protecting the euro.
In Italy, Berlusconi's government weathers the storm
After Italy started the week in a disturbing way, the situation improved slightly yesterday with the reflux of the 10-year bond rates.
A recovery from the precarious calm.
At the end of a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional presidents have said that they heard Giulio Tremonti describe the situation as "indecipherable" and that an "unpredictable" weekend was expected, statements later denied by the interested party.
In any case, on Tuesday the difference with German long-term rates had reached a record high of 210 basis points and the price of hedging contracts against the risk of bankruptcy (CRQ) had skyrocketed to 263 points, causing a certain stir in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi commented that, in Spain, the difference with the German rates was more than 400 basis points.
But his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, said he was "deeply concerned" about "the turbulence in the markets" and a possible contagion from Ireland.
“The good news is that Italy, the euro zone’s third largest economy, is not like Greece or Ireland.”
“The bad news is that it’s like Portugal,” explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
In reality, its problem is the lack of growth and the stagnation of income associated with it, which causes the State to run the risk of not being able to meet its financing needs.
Brussels’ latest forecasts have provided a cold jug of water for the government.
Italian growth is estimated to reach 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012, while the budget being examined in the Senate is based on figures of 1.3% and 2%, respectively.
Under these conditions, according to the European Commission, the public deficit will represent 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to 3.9% planned by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumor that new budgetary provisions can be applied after the holidays, for an amount of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, further austerity measures will have to be adopted," says Economic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn.
At the moment, Italy has the support of international institutions.
"The foundations of its economy are in order and its accounts are in good shape, as we have been saying for a long time," said Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund responsible for Italy at the IMF.
“There is no immediate problem, either short- or long-term, because despite its considerable debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, editor’s note), the stabilization efforts requested of Italy are less than those required of other countries,” comments Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD chief economist.
There remains the problem of political instability.
On December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the Chamber of Deputies, after which the elections could be anticipated at the end of March.
In such a case, there would be an unfavourable period for decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on strengthening mechanisms to fight the crisis
Christine Lagarde said: “I think we have already shown on Sunday night and day that Europeans are clearly supportive, determined, committed to defending their currency and their currency zone.”
Although it was relative, yesterday’s relaxation in the rates of European states’ obligations has propelled governments and the ECB.
However, we cannot yet speak of a principle of normalisation.
Ratings agency Standard & Poor’s announced it could lower Portugal’s debt rating, the most frequent target of speculation at the moment.
“As in May, there is a real lack of political clarity and transparency, which weighs significantly on banking systems,” say the economists at Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially because “the political pace is much slower than the pace of the markets.”
Aware of this hiatus and the dangers it hides, European countries are intensifying discussions to strengthen the mechanisms for exiting the crisis that already exist.
Informal consultations between the Finance Ministers most directly affected and, in general, with their G20 counterparts are on track.
And this also taking into account the meetings of the Eurogroup and the Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the agenda, the type of unconventional measures to support euro area countries in the market collimator (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), its executive director, Klaus Regling, has started on Tuesday in Singapore a tour of Asia to inform investors from the Far East about the news of the crisis in Europe.
Although the goal of these visits is not to raise funds, it certainly sets the stage.
The first EFSF bond issues are expected to take place next month.
A U.S. official told Reuters yesterday that the United States would support a potential increase in the funds mobilized through an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
As for the countries at the forefront, Portugal and Spain, they are preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly in relation to the organisation of the labour market.
These reforms add to the austerity measures with a closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to move on a different path from the one followed by Greece and Ireland.
Both want to avoid at all costs requesting international aid before applying their own budget corrections and deciding on structural reforms that they consider indispensable to increase confidence in a lasting way.
The capitalist partners of the European funds, finally, consider the options available to accelerate the process of normalization of public bond markets.
Passing through Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber was the first to launch the idea that, if the €750 billion mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to take out its portfolio again.
Economists at Barclays Capital, a front-line player in the European public debt market, believe that an amount of around an additional 100 billion euros would be sufficient, “preferably” in the form of a direct injection of liquidity.
There is the instrument for this: the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism, currently endowed with €60 billion.
A council that, no doubt, could examine in detail the European capitals.
Especially if market conditions worsen.
Snow and ice: 24 departments on orange alert
Snow continues to cause traffic difficulties, especially on the secondary network in Brittany, and can affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are currently on orange alert due to the risk of snowfall and ice formation.
Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-S<0xC3><0xA8>vres and Vienne have joined the twenty departments that were already on orange alert, eighteen from Wednesday at noon and two, Dordogne and Gironde, joined the group in the evening.
According to Météo France, heavy snowfalls affect the north of Gironde and Charentes, although it also snows slightly on the <0xC3><0x8E>le-de-France.
Layers of snow between 2 and 5 cm, occasionally between 7 and 10 cm, are expected in the affected departments, and between 1 and 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm, in the Paris region.
The affected departments are Charente, Charente-Maritime, C<0xC3><0xB4>tes d'Armor, Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the regions of Lower Normandy, <0xC3><0x8E>le-de-France and Limousin.
Snow is strong enough to cause traffic difficulties and affect some economic activities, warns Météo France.
In the C<0xC3><0xB4>tes d'Armor, access to several departmental roads has been prohibited for heavy vehicles over 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axles.
According to the gendarmes, the circulation in the secondary network of Brittany is complicated, so they recommend that you do not drive except in case of need and the circulation of certain TER vehicles during the day has been prohibited.
On Thursday, school transportation was banned in Picardy.
No specific measures were planned for Wednesday night to limit the movement of heavy vehicles.
The prefecture “urges all drivers to drive with the greatest caution on the roads and to adapt their driving to the situation.”
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked airlines to cancel on Thursday 25% of their flights at the Paris Roissy airport and 10% in Orly because of the expected snowfall.
The DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh Airport, in Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro du Grand Paris: first financial drafts
Since the debate on the modernisation of transport on the <0xC3><0x8E>le-de-France has reached its peak, it has rained billions.
At least in the debate.
In particular, we are talking about the 23 billion for the Grand Paris metro to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
To start this GSP, the State has announced an allocation of funds of 4 billion euros.
Theoretically, this sum will be the one that will later allow the SGP to obtain loans in the markets to finance part of its double loop.
Today, we finally have the first accounts.
The amending finance law of 2010, examined in the finance commission of the National Assembly this morning, contains the devices planned to find the first part of that money.
There are two ways: the creation of a special equipment tax and the increase of the tax on offices in the <0xC3><0x8E>le-de-France.
The first, as we read in Article 15 of the text of the bill, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
In addition, it is fixed in numbers: "The product of this tax is 117 million euros a year."
The second is an amendment to a tax on offices that already exists "to modernize it, increase its product and allocate said increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would you get with this method?
Who knows.
No figures are given in the text.
But it's far from $4 billion.
"It is specified that the tax resources are added to the 4 billion euros of the allocation of funds that will be mobilized by the State and that will be granted to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses," we can read in the explanatory memorandum.
The SGP is not surprised by this system.
“From the moment income is created, we can cover the studies for three years and then receive the $4 billion later, as we explain.”
“It will be recorded in the budget and used as needed.”
The GSP estimates that it will start receiving $4 billion in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This device, in which the promised $4 billion is not included in the credit, can provoke a slightly heated parliamentary debate.
The first public session will be on December 7.
Avenging hackers and diligent spies
The WikiLeaks affair has a double value.
On the one hand, it reveals an apparent scandal, a scandal that only seems scandalous in the face of the hypocrisy that governs relations between States, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it heralds profound changes on an international scale and foresees a future dominated by regression.
But let's go step by step.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that each file created by a secret service (regardless of the nation to which it belongs) consists exclusively of press clippings.
The “extraordinary” US revelations about Berlusconi’s sexual mores only reflect what has been written for months in any newspaper (except those belonging to Berlusconi) and Gaddafi’s ominously ridiculing profile has long given cabaret artists ideas to create their sketches.
The rule that secret files should only be made up of public knowledge news is essential to the dynamics of the secret services, and not just in this century.
If you visit a bookshop dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each work repeats (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Ch<0xC3><0xA2>teau, the Templars or the Rosicrucians) exactly what had been written in the previous works.
This is not only because the authors of occult texts do not want to do unpublished research (or do not know where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who are dedicated to the occult not only trust what they already know, what reconfirms what they had already learned.
This is the mechanism of Dan Brown’s success.
The same applies to secret files.
The informant is lazy, just as he is lazy (or has little anxiety) the head of the secret services (if he could not be, what I know, editor of the Libération), who only considers true what he can recognize.
The top secret information about Berlusconi sent by the U.S. Embassy in Rome to the State Department was the same as what Newsweek published the week before.
So why have the revelations of these files caused such a stir?
On the one hand, they only say what every cultured person already knows, that is, that embassies, at least since World War II and since heads of state can call each other on the phone or catch the plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of some limited exercises of representation, have been transformed into spy centers.
Any viewer who watches investigative films knows this perfectly, we just pretend that we do not know it because of hypocrisy.
In any case, repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy and gives a bad image of American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can consult the most secretive secrets of the most powerful country in the world considerably affects the prestige of the State Department.
Therefore, the scandal affects both the victims and the "verdugos".
But let’s get into the true nature of what has happened.
Formerly, in Orwell’s time, one could conceive of all power as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell’s prophecy has come true since, being able to control every movement thanks to the telephone, every transaction made, hotel visited, highway taken, the citizen thus became a complete victim of the eye of power.
But when it is shown, as it is now, that even the crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control relationship ceases to be one-way and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen (at least the hacker, chosen as the avenger of the citizens) can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that can no longer even keep its own secrets hold?
It is true, as Georg Simmel said, that a true secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that all knowledge about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is in fact an empty secret, without a secret, since it comes from the public sphere; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks has done, that Hillary Clinton’s secrets were empty secrets means to take away all power.
WikiLeaks has done no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but yes, very much, to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound caused to such a powerful power?
It is clear that, in the future, States will no longer be able to put any confidential information on the Internet, since it would be like publishing it on a poster in the middle of the street.
But it’s also clear that, with today’s technologies, you can’t expect to have confidential conversations over the phone.
Nothing is easier than to find out if and when a Head of State has travelled by plane and contacted one of his counterparts.
How will they be able to maintain private and confidential relationships in the future?
I know perfectly well that, for the moment, my foresight is a matter of science fiction and, therefore, novelistic, but I imagine government agents who move discreetly in stagecoaches with uncontrollable itineraries, carrying messages that have been learned by heart or, at most, hiding some data written on the heels of their shoes.
That information is then kept, in a single copy, in locked drawers: after all, the Watergate spying attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
In the past, I have written that technology currently advances like a crab, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet has once again created a wired telegraph (telephone).
Video (analog) tapes had allowed film researchers to study a film step by step, moving forward and backward, discovering all the secrets of editing, while now (digital) CDs only allow to move forward or backward from chapter to chapter, that is, to enormous proportions.
With the high-speed trains, we can go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, with the journeys that it entails, we need three and a half hours.
Therefore, it is nothing out of the ordinary that politics and communication techniques lead us back to horse-drawn carriages.
One last comment.
In the past, the press tried to understand what was being secretly plotted in embassies.
At present, it is the embassies that request confidential information from the press.
Climate: France’s blunders in its funding promises
One year after the Copenhagen Accord, it is time to examine whether the fast-unlocked funding promises (called fast start or early) made by developed countries have been respected.
And the French faux pas have been revealed.
In the Copenhagen Accord, developed countries committed to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union pledged 7.2 billion euros in three years and France committed 1.26 billion euros (i.e. 420 million euros per year).
During the opening of COP16, the EU has put on the table its best cards to convince its partners that its commitment to fast start financing is true: a report detailing the measures of its Member States, a press conference, a large complementary event, the distribution of brochures...
The transparency operation turned out to be appreciable and was appreciated for what it really was worth: developing countries and civil society would want all developed countries to do the same and with the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released €2.2 billion in 2010, putting it on track to deliver on its €7.2 billion commitment in 2012.
But, if we study the situation in detail, things are more complicated.
Under the Copenhagen Accord, the money must be “new and additional” to ensure that a complementary effort is made, without harming official development assistance.
Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached on what "new and additional" means.
When the European Commission proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
At present, everyone chooses the reference that suits him best.
For example, the European Commission has taken 2009 as a reference year: international financing is maintained and 150 million are added in three years for fast start financing.
Other countries have chosen similar benchmarks with regard to the year or level of official development assistance.
On the contrary, France considers that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 are "new and additional".
In other words, no reference is made to the expenditure of previous years or to the total level of official development assistance.
In particular, the total amount of French aid to developing countries may remain stable (or even decrease), while it intends to respect its commitment to "new and additional" funds...
Another crucial element is the distribution between donations and loans.
Again, there is no standard and everyone chooses the method of calculation.
Some, such as France, consider that every euro borrowed is equivalent to one euro donated.
Evidently, such a thing is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
Although the use of loans may be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often, projects related to emission reduction that are based on more effective technologies), it is fallacious to present a euro that will be recovered as equivalent to a euro that is donated ... At most, only the cost of the loan for the country that grants the loan (that is, the equivalent of an interest rate) should be calculated for its commitments.
But France finds no such reasoning useful: it “respects” its 420 million euro commitment by making 91.5% of loans (389.8 million euro) and 8.5% of donations (36.1 million euro); see the EU document to see for yourself.
This is the only country in the Union that uses the loan so frequently.
Germany uses it at 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia, among others, respect their commitments with 100% of donations.
In other words, when the majority of the European Union contributes one euro to meet its commitment, France only contributes ten cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
A good trick!
In short, in its fast start financing, France makes a double abuse: on the one hand, in relation to actions over time and, on the other hand, in relation to the real financial effort.
Spending just 36.1 million euros, he manages to give the impression that he spends 420 million "new and additional", as he had promised.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that it is Bercy who has taken care of the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would the other Member States continue to donate when they can simply lend?) and in the negotiations, since the developing countries are not fools...
The chapter on early financing is a relatively short-term detail in relation to the climate negotiations as a whole.
But it could be one more grain of sand in the immense machinery that is the UNFCCC.
Let's hope it doesn't.
Whatever it is, it is essential to learn from this first year of early financing.
First of all, France could announce a change in its calculation method for the years 2011 and 2012, with the intention of respecting its commitments and in the same way as the other countries of the European Union.
But, especially, France could push forward the discussions on the stakes in relation to long-term financing (another essential chapter currently under discussion): we will not get rid of the question of "additional character" or the method of computing loans.
France could change its position to become as progressive on this issue as it is on others.
We therefore have hope for the new Environment Minister, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement about France’s fast start and its vision of “additional character” and the use of loans would help to improve the level of international confidence needed to move the negotiations forward.
Warning about pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old child ingests 81 different chemicals in a day, according to a study published Wednesday by the association Generations Futures (the old movement for the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which warns that its results “do not have a significant statistical value taking into account the limited number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem treated”, acquired in supermarkets of Oise and Paris between July and September the foods that a child of about ten years old usually consumes in four meals and a snack a day.
These model meals, which follow official recommendations (five parts of fresh fruits and vegetables, three parts of dairy products and 1.5 liters of water a day), as well as sweets, were examined in laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other contaminants.
The balance of the dish is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, of which 42 are classified as possible or probable carcinogens and five substances classified as safe carcinogens, as well as 37 substances likely to act as endocrine disruptors (EP), according to studies by various institutions such as the International Cancer Research Center.
"Although, in virtually all cases, the legal limits for each of the chemicals are not exceeded individually, our study clearly shows that consumer exposure to possibly carcinogenic and/or PE contaminants is worrisome," the association notes.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three considered safe carcinogens, as well as about twenty residues that can harm the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, planned as a snack for the school, contains traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to green beans from Kenya, included in the food, in which the study has detected traces of a potent insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, Russian steak, canned tuna, and even bread bar or chewing gum were seasoned with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water, analyses discovered the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon slice was the most “nutritious” with 34 chemical residues detected and even the analysis of the plastic dish used to heat the food in the microwave was not completely clean.
The final risk these “pollutant cocktails” pose to the consumer “is probably underestimated,” the study says.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV), for its part, has proposed "in the face of the gravity of the situation" to apply a moratorium on the use of pesticides to curb "the increase in diseases associated with civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) indicated the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 in cereals.
