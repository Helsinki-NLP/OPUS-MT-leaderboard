The Prague Stock Exchange finished with fewer points at the end of the day
After the rapid fall of the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses.
Transactions of <0xC4><0x8C>EZ shares reached approximately half their value on a normal day.
The Prague Stock Exchange, at the beginning of trading Tuesday, reacted immediately to Monday’s drop when it fell to about 6%.
The drop this time is due to the fall in stocks on Wall Street.
Also here is the reaction of the market to the result of the vote of the American Assembly of Representatives that refused to support the stabilization plan of the secretary of the financial sector.
Falling Stocks in Asia
Shares in Asian stocks fell dramatically on Tuesday, though over the course of the day the index eventually cushioned some of the losses.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng Stock Exchange’s index throughout its financial day marked almost four percent, although it later cushioned its losses by reducing the decline by virtually 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which tracks Chinese stock movements on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, fell 3.8 percent, while markets in Shanghai were closed.
Sydney Stock Exchange shares lost more than five percent but, in the end, the losses dropped to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange according to the secretary of the Index fell to 3.6 percent.
“Scheduled rescue actions in the U.S. are unsafe and this influences the financial market around the world,” said Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Currency Office.
Although Hong Kong is a part of China, it alone determines its monetary policy, that is, without dependence on the Central Bank of China.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as those in the United States.
US lawmakers should reconvene as soon as possible, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, and approve a proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, it threatens that the falls will be felt in other countries.
Bloody Bath of American Stocks
On Monday, the American Assembly of Representatives rejected the plan to help the financial system to which 700 billion dollars should be devoted (almost 12 trillion crowns).
Legislators thus ignored President George Bush’s invitation to support his plan.
For Bush, the plan would fix the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
On Monday, U.S. stocks went through a bloody bath and mainly the stock index picked up the biggest drop in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell to nearly seven percent, with a similar volume drop last seen in 1987.
The index fell before it was announced but as soon as it was shown that the proposal of the assembly did not go ahead, the index began to fall freely.
Congress Withdraws: U.S. Government Can Inject $700 Billion Into Banking
The highest representatives of Congress and the government, President George W. Bush, agreed to a pact in broad terms of financial aid to the American financial system.
Their vote will take place early next week.
U.S. lawmakers sparked a rift in talks over the approval of the bailout plan in its form of aid to the U.S. financial system in the amount of $700 billion (about 12 trillion kroner).
However, it is not yet won.
Congressmen must fine-tune some details of the contract before they can make public the final form of the law and have it voted on.
The plan to help the financial system will be discussed at the House of Representatives on Monday.
Barney Frank, chairman of the Committee for Financial Services and Assembly Banking, told Reuters on Sunday.
According to some sources, the vote on the plan could be held in the Senate no earlier than Wednesday.
According to economists, the arrival of the ratification of the rescue plan should represent the announcement of a first psychologically significant factor for the revitalization of the financial market.
Then, however, there will be "disenchantment" thanks to the complex mechanisms whose aid to the market will also reach in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We have made a great progress.
“We have resolved our differing views on how the market stabilization package should look,” Pelosi told Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could still take place on Sunday.
Representatives of the lawmakers met Sunday night with Finance Minister Henry Paulson to give a definitive form to the government’s fund.
It should buy unsold mortgage assets from financial corporations that lead financial firms to heavy losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
"We are about to close the agreement on the plan, which will work and must also be effective in the market.
We still need to continue with the sanitation plan, but I think we're already at it," Paulson said.
A Sign for Asian Business
The global financial crisis has a direct impact on the rapidly falling stock market.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are doing everything they can to get Congress to finally approve a deal on Sunday.
They want to reassure investors about the Asian financial market as these are the ones that are in the first time zone and where Congress could influence Monday’s trade.
However, for now there is nothing clear for sure about when the two chambers of the American Congress will vote and, not even, if they will not stagnate at the last moment with some problem.
Lawmakers expect it to be approved in the coming days.
The law, however, will undergo a number of changes.
The total amount intended to assist the system should be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion must be made available as soon as possible, as requested by President George Bush.
However, Congress can block the release of the remaining amount if it has the impression that the program does not fulfill its function, which would be another 100 billion dollars and, later, the last 350 billion dollars.
Bush Appreciated the Progress of the Meetings
On the other hand, the president can veto this decision but Congress can override his veto by a majority vote.
Despite these changes, the basic idea of the program was to win financial resources for the repurchase of bad mortgage securities whose value fell because hundreds of thousands of Americans are not able to finish paying their mortgages.
“We’ve worked everything.
The House of Representatives would have to be prepared to vote on the bill on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
President Bush is also pleased with the progress of the meetings.
Spokesman Tony Fratto said Bush was pleased with Saturday's progress and valued "both sides' efforts to stabilize our financial market and protect our economy."
Limitation of the armored contract
The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Christopher Dodd, chief negotiator, said lawmakers decided on the responsibility of program money for protecting taxpayers’ taxes from their losses, a easing closure of the scheduled finance plan.
The new law must also limit the so-called armored contracts for directors of the companies participating in the program, and creates a committee that will have control of the Fund.
This would have to be directed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We’ve worked very hard on it, and we’ve made a big step toward the agreement that will work and that will be effective for the market and for all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also aims to help homeowners who are having trouble with their payments.
The government would have to agree to new mortgage payments it buys in order to lower the monthly charges on debtors’ installment payments and make it possible for them to keep their homes.
Marek: psychological help
The proposed plan is, according to the chief economist of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea that will be realized but quite difficult.
"And this is why it is not known with what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets will be bought.
This will be decisive for the sharing of losses between the financial sector and the government," Marek said this week, for the iHNed.cz server.
Whether the plan is approved now or early next week is not, according to Marek, as relevant.
"Much more important is that, already this week, the congressmen agree on your support and give you their approval as soon as possible.
This important and psychological agreement to get that approval is, right now, the most important thing," Marek insisted.
Armed hand fighting: the MP3 player against the mobile.
We advise you how to choose
While almost all mobile plays MP3 files, no MP3 player can make calls.
It seems clear that it is better to buy only the phone.
Yet there are sufficient reasons for man to acquire only the reproductive.
The choice practically depends on the way of its use and the demand of the future owner.
It will probably be difficult for him to acquire the most modern turntable to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album on it.
On the other hand this type of musical products such as LP records no longer come out, and as far as their quality is concerned there is not a single objective reason to continue buying them.
If vinyl records are crammed on your shelves with art rock, jazz or blues music, you are probably dreaming, at least, of this type of record player.
This is the same with music that is on the way, that is, compressed, simplified music - music in MP3.
And here there are price and quality categories.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, just as for a lover of Pink Floyd who will hardly try the market helmets of twenty crowns.
Two ends, between which there is enough space for each.
The choice is wide.
It also determines the battery life.
Some of the best players get much more than just playing music and even what not even most mobiles.
No device today is as universal as the telephone.
Faced with the most elementary functions such as telephone, send messages, can play music and video, record both, has a better or worse camera and can even navigate.
And when we take into consideration the Smartphone and PDAs will also have in their pocket a small computer.
This is a small miracle since no refrigerator can make a barbecue and no television can photograph.
The universality of mobile phones also brings us disadvantages.
The more features you use on your phone, the sooner the display indicator will light up asking to be recharged.
And playing music is one of the biggest drains of energy.
There are few mobile phones that can play music for more than ten or twelve hours, most much less.
In this sense, music players (especially the simplest) clearly have a higher performance.
Therefore, keep in mind that cheap mobile phones will not play for more than two hours.
If in addition to this, in addition, constantly call still get, for more safety, a charger for work - this is also valid for the most expensive appliances.
With the MP3 player this problem is not going to have it, as even the worst ones endure at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation after a load.
Another problem happens when recording music on the mobile.
Unfortunately, only a part of the devices has the universal USB connector and, in addition, not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without special software.
Of course it is possible to record music directly to the memory card but only in some drives without reduction can connect the small memory cards that are used in mobiles.
In players, with some exception (iPod), no special software is needed.
Simply fill the device with music through the USB of the computer.
Most mobiles and players create their own order in the music library based on the performer's name, album title, genre, or user rating.
Some devices only show a directory with a tree structure similar to a Windows Finder and some recognize both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
The player tries to serve, the mobile knows more
For the choice of a specific equipment, be interested in the resistance of the accumulator, the memory capacity, the quality and type of sound output and, of course, the convenience of its operation.
If you listen, above all, to the music as a background and you will listen to it every day only for a while, as in the tram, then it is enough for you with any mobile that you play.
This is something that almost every mobile phone can do.
You should not even care about the format in which the mobile or player plays the music.
The MP3 plays it all and practically all the music that comes to you will be in this format.
It is among the most widespread and except for him the absolute majority of devices play music in WMA format.
The least include the AAC format (format used by the Apple company and its iPod).
The best mobiles also make it possible, for example, to buy music online.
It is enough through the mobile internet to visit the competent pages of the operator (or any other service provider) and buy a song or an album.
This service could be on its own a weighty argument to acquire a mobile for music.
Unfortunately the offer of operators is miserable and most are limited only to the topics of fleeting success of the radios.
The prices are also not the lowest.
However, in general, it is assumed that precisely this way of selling music (whether by GSM, internet or wireless internet) in the future will dominate the music industry.
Most people always carry a cell phone.
Whenever you feel like listening to something, you will find the mobile in your pocket, while the MP3 player will be forgotten at home.
However, it still depends on whether you always carry headphones or, at least, handsfree.
If not, you can use an integrated player that has virtually every mobile even if it is at least an MP3 player.
Probably the biggest advantage for many of the mobiles with music will be its price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand.
Between three and four thousand crowns you can already acquire a good walkman.
Most of you will be limited by the absence of a classic headphone jack.
The best, even when it comes to the technical part, such as phones equipped with a 3.5 mm input for classic headphones, cost up to fifteen thousand.
Again, the advantage of the players is nothing but their easy service.
The simplest players - by no means necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - are really handled by anyone.
The minimal functions, its handling similar to the previous current cassettes or also to the turntables is evident.
It does not represent a threat in the sense that by mistake we connect to the internet with the mobile and, consequently, gigantic account for data download.
Which device to choose
Even the cheapest mobile phones (for example, the Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for changing the memory card (M2 type, micro SD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of a suitable card will reach two thousand crowns.
However, be careful.
The basic models are usually equipped only with a 2 GB card of maximum capacity.
Only the most expensive ones have a memory of 8 GB.
If you already have a mobile and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a look at Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
Depending on the capacity (maximum 2 GB) it is not necessary to spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If you consider yourself among the most demanding music lovers, take advantage of the most specialized mobile-walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have independent keys for the MP3 which makes a service as comfortable as that of the same player.
The most specialized of all is Sony Ericsson, whose Walkman line mobiles have almost identical use as that of a standalone MP3 player.
The same service and the same category in terms of price, over the four thousand crowns, but with a greater memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and accumulator (usually 15 hours, with a maximum performance of up to 35 hours), the most arriary cited brand brings them MP3 players.
The first virtual operator will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Probably.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite developed and our operators offer practically all services as their Western European partners.
However, here we still lack something - the virtual operator, which would force those to be cheaper.
He'll probably be here soon.
That Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe, we have already written on mobil.cz.
The rest was also confirmed by the Czech Telecommunication Office (<0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>) which warned that the price of SMS messages in our country is one of the most expensive in the entire Union.
After the latest steps of the European Commission in the field of the regulation of roaming charges, a paradoxical situation is likely to be reached - for some customers of Czech mobile operators SMS sending from abroad will be cheaper than if they send them from home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, lack competition you really want to fight.
This probably seems paradoxical to us, since we have three mobile networks and their high coverage is more than 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that there is extreme competition in the Czech market.
Pavel Dvo<0xC5><0x99>ák, Chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (<0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>), said that there is no longer any place in the Czech Republic for any other operator.
It is perhaps true that for a classic operator with its own network it no longer has too many possibilities (for the rest, it would be very difficult to find some frequency).
However, there is still a possibility - the virtual operator.
It was precisely the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile phone market that brought about a significant drop in prices, to which the classic operators had to react as well.
At the same time, even before sharks like Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile entered the UK market, similar voices were heard both there and here.
It was shown that there is room for this type of operators and that they can succeed.
There is no need to look too far for examples.
In February of this year we inform you about the premiere of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
After only half a year, this operator managed to get more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator in the neighboring country.
Moreover, behind Mobilking is the Penta group which, apart from that, in the Czech Republic is the owner of U:fon.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility of concentrating on many more specific target groups.
In addition, for them to operate effectively, they need far fewer customers than a classic operator.
They do not carry with them relatively large expenses in construction, operation and maintenance of the network.
In the world this type of virtual operators are usually profiled with low expenses - they offer cheap calls and SMS messages that however, are often counterbalanced with the offer of tighter services.
Thus, for example, Tesco mobile in Britain offers SMS at least half as cheap as the competition.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows it can be a good hit also betting on a non-trivial target group.
This operator is specifically addressed to man.
“The right man chooses Mobilking – it’s the operator he likes and can trust,” says David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, which works this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether such a concept as that of Poland could catch on in our country.
Vodafone spokesman Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> said: “The Czech market is relatively small to access by segments on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, from the point of view of the offer of services it is relatively saturated "
In the Czech Republic there are no possibilities, say mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if in the Czech Republic there will be any virtual operator that will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, however, in the Czech Republic it does not seem too hopeful.
Rather, it is the launch of Mobilking in other countries in our region," Jana Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ková, a spokeswoman for the financial group Penta, told mobil.cz by phone.
Indirectly he assured that the current mobile operators in the Czech Republic definitely do not bow to this idea.
Rather the opposite, they try to do everything possible so that no potential competition arises.
Interest in the launch of a virtual mobile operator is already shown by the GTS Novera group that would like to take a step further to become a real competition of Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica O2 in the field of business customers.
"We have a great interest in this, so that we can offer our customers not only fixed telephony services but also mobile telephony.
And the sooner, the better.
With this possibility we have met repeatedly with all Czech mobile operators.
With some of them we have made progress in the meetings," said the group's spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
So, maybe they're flashing better times.
It seems that, for unofficial information, the first official operator would have to arrive possibly already at the end of the year.
But for now his appearance is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
“At the moment we believe that the situation is ideal for the emergence of a virtual operator in the Czech market.
The Czech market compared to others is a very specific market.
So far no one has approached us with any complex and serious project in this field," Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88>, a spokesman for Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica O2, told mobil.cz.
Other operators refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová, in exceptional accordance with O2’s opinion, adds: “To date we have not registered any viable commercial project that, bilaterally beneficial, can continue to be developed.”
“On the T-Mobile network, it will be difficult to find a virtual operator until the end of the year.
At this moment we should already have on the table some concrete contract that would be possible to study in such a short horizon.
Vodafone focuses its attention on meeting the requirements of a 3G license.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> adds: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and this in terms of cost sharing and infrastructure.
We consider it as the greatest contribution from the point of view of customers.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this field is to find the partner with whom to establish a shared network for fast mobile internet.”
Responsible offices - with nail and meat operators
The progress of mobile operators can be easily understood, but the entry of another operator would mean increasing competition which would lead to a drop in prices and with it, a decline in profits.
So why facilitate entry into the competition?
When operators want to get something, they are able to pull on the same rope, proof of this is the grip when U:fon emerged.
Perhaps the biggest pressure on <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> was at the time of U:fon’s entry by T-Mobile.
This is attested by the public information accessible on the web pages of the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>.
But right now U:fon serves as an argument as to why not accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová adds: “Furthermore, it wasn’t long ago that the competitive environment in the mobile phone market was opened up to a fourth operator.
As far as the character of the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic is concerned, it is natural that the entry of another player into the market would mean for him and, above all, for his services, great requirements."
This is why this access to mobile operators is tremendously discouraging due to the sheer disinterest of the Czech regulatory body.
This is not just the position of the <0xC4><0x8C>TU, which unfortunately has no competence to intervene in commercial tenders, unlike Great Britain and other developed countries.
This belongs purely to the Office for the Protection of Commercial Tenders (<0xC3><0x9A>OHS).
However, she expressed her typical position on this issue.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible after an agreement on the rental of the necessary infrastructure between a mobile operator and a virtual operator was concluded.
To date, no agreement has been closed because the offer of potential stakeholders was not interesting enough for classic operators," Kristián Chalupa, from the Department of Foreign Affairs of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS, added to our question.
These statements are not surprising to the representatives of the operators.
For offices that must represent the interests of consumers, this is more than a consideration; apart from that, they should note that no one takes advantage of their position in the market.
Especially when Kristian Chalupa adds: "Overseas where virtual operators operate normally we can see that their entry into the market contributed to the drop in prices of mobile phone services"
Obviously, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market means and the drop in prices are not in the interest of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
Really what is dramatically shocking in this whole case lies in the dissonant reactions that result from the three mobile operators.
The question of whether it really is a coincidence, is offered on its own.
It is the same as with the price of gasoline in gas stations because it is clear that it is the work of chance and a hard struggle for competition.
"The Office has found no signs of unfair competition in this respect and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position therefore they do not have a corresponding increase of responsibility in their actions in the market.
The necessary tools to open the mobile phone market to virtual operators, rather, are missing, as well as telecommunications regulators," Chalupa added to his response.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of the many points of conflict.
There is obviously an analysis of relevant markets prepared by the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> according to which telecommunications are, from the point of view of commercial tendering, a single market.
In this type of market, of course, none of the Czech operators has a dominant position.
However, some of the legal experts offer another vision - for a virtual operator to emerge, an agreement with the network administrator is always necessary.
And the mobile operator – with all its logic – has a monopoly on its network.
Therefore, in a particular segment it must necessarily be dominant.
And if this argument were not accepted, at least for UOHS it should represent a warning that three mobile operators rise strikingly similarly.
The current complaints from the interested parties (including the aforementioned GTS Novera) show that in all negotiations with the operators they encounter many similar impediments.
Carrying the responsibility on the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> is a fairly common trick in the field of telecommunications from which the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS washes its hands in all this matter.
We have met with him already in some similar cases.
Unfortunately recently a new amendment to the Telecommunications Law was presented for the expansion of the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>'s competence in the field of commercial tenders which was not carried out, even though a number of specialists promised that the situation would improve.
This must be perfectly known by the representatives of <0xC3><0x9A>OHS, but it is evident that their interests are elsewhere.
All is well when no one is looking
At the same time, something like a pseudo-virtual operator still operates unnoticed, and there are already quite a few of them on the Czech mobile networks.
They are companies that put their own prices on mobile phone services that, however, only a part are public.
Usually these are companies that are dedicated to multilevel marketing.
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
Usually only a few chosen ones get the price list of these companies.
The magic is that the company, with respect to the operator, acts as a classic business customer of the same ordering a large number of SIM cards.
As a special customer you will then receive special prices and other offers.
The problem is that commercial conditions in all Czech mobile operators prohibit such resale.
“If cases like the ones you cite were discovered, we could talk about breach of contract conditions that could result in the end of the collaboration with the given society,” Martina Kemrová responded to the question on this problem.
But it is quite unlikely that an activity of this kind carried out by mobile operators would not reach responsible people.
It is precisely in the case of the three companies mentioned that thousands of customers may be involved.
None of the operators are against this procedure.
With the activities of these companies they make a not inconsiderable profit and at the same time - unlike the real virtual operators - in no way threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> warns us of possible problems: "The law allows such speculation, however, the services of this company are used only by a negligible so much percent of customers.
These, in addition, must accept that the SIM card of their phone is not in their name so they can not absolutely dispose of it as a normal customer of the operators. "
Precisely this is what should seem to the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> minimally strange.
In addition, a new question appears for the UOHS.
If mobile operators turn a blind eye to this type of procedure, why are they blocking the entry of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS has enough competence to discover this type of activities and if it is not going to want it should not be satisfied with the explanations of the operators that they have no idea of this history and that their commercial conditions do not allow it.
When will we stop being the most expensive
As already made clear in the text, the entry of the virtual operator in the mobile phone market brought a significant decline in the prices of services.
At the same time, in practically every country where the virtual operator emerged, the classic operators more or less tried to protect themselves from this irruption.
The arguments used by these were virtually all identical - too small, a market eventually too saturated, problems with service quality, etc.
In the most advanced countries, however, regulatory bodies have intervened and in none of the cases defended the operators but their customers.
Whether it was formal measures or informal pressure, they managed to get the first virtual operator to emerge and with it more began to emerge.
Unfortunately, this whole case is being handled by the Czech Regulatory Authority as if it were a burning nail.
From our experience we cannot help but be impressed that the confusion of attributions in these cases suits them.
But let us not despair.
If this behind-the-scenes information is correct and the virtual operator actually reaches these lands, then the Czech mobile phone market will probably start moving again.
If any of the operators lets in a virtual mobile operator it will be difficult for the UOHS to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other interested parties.
And we will perhaps stop calling it more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four presentations of the new version of the Czech official anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the occasion of the day of official Czech celebrations presented the new official recording of the anthem Where, My Home.
The new anthem was recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlávek.
There are four versions available - two versions that are Solos, one male voice and one female voice, another with Choir and another instrumental.
The singers are Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>nková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the arrangements of the anthem are Otakar Jeremiá<0xC5><0xA1> and Jaroslav Kr<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to all four versions.
B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlávek considers this Czech national song as one of the most beautiful hymns.
Czech Radio has said before that it intentionally chose for the Solos singers with representatively young voices who are more expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I tried with the two and then also with the choir to look at the diction so that the text was well understood, so that it had consonance," he said.
The Czech national anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where, My Home was first played in 1834 on the stage of the State Theatre in the original Czech play Fidlova<0xC4><0x8D>ka by Josef Kajetán Tyl and arranged with the music of Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek <0xC5><0xA0>kroup.
It gained popularity and people made it their own.
The first stanza of the song after the emergence of Czechoslovakia in 1918 naturally became a part of the official anthem.
One of the seven official symbols remained even after the emergence of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "new" anthem sounds
Prague’s MHD takes us Wednesday for the first time with the chip
Wednesday, October 1, 2008, is written in the history of the Prague Transport Company the date on which the first passengers enter the metro, tram and bus with an electronic voucher in their pockets instead of a paper ticket.
It can be purchased right now by almost one hundred thousand people who own the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can purchase the 30-day, 90-day and annual voucher (this will be valid from 1 January 2009) and simultaneously load it onto their chip card at the transport company’s infocentres and stations in the Metro, Muzeum, M<0xC5><0xAF>stek, Nádra<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD> Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice, And<0xC4><0x9B>l, Roztyly, Let<0xC5><0x88>rovany, Kobyany stations.
The vouchers can already be purchased yesterday on the internet on the pages of the transport company, www.dpp.cz.
The service, until the afternoon, was used by more than four hundred people.
Those who start using the internet as a form of commerce, can definitely start to forget about the ticket stands in the metro stations, where until now they had to regularly queue to get a normal ticket.
The voucher is purchased online, and the Opencard is recharged at one of the thirteen branches of the Municipal Library.
“In these places there is a window available to passengers with trained staff that helps those interested with the purchase online and also with the reloading of the purchased voucher on their card,” said project spokesman Martin Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD>.
Apart from the library, it will also be possible to top up the electronic voucher on the Opencard at vending machines located in some metro lobbies.
What are these vending machines like?
They are red, they remind us of a ticket machine and travelers will probably have already noticed them in the metro stations of Roztyly, Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are now five in the city but by the end of the year there should be eighty," Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD> added.
The bonus is controlled by the machine instead of the driver
The use of the machine, which will start working tomorrow, is simple.
Simply insert the Opencard chip card into it and the previously paid bonus will be charged to it only.
The electronic bonds from tomorrow are valid not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is, on the bypass trains and bus lines from numbers 300 to 499 used mainly by the inhabitants of the localities of central Bohemia.
"On the trains attached to the Prague integrated transport there are revisers equipped with a reader card that will help confirm the validity of the time and the zone of the voucher," explained the control of the tickets, Filip Drápal of the organization Ropid that establishes the schedules of the collective transport of Prague.
The bypass buses have their reader cards mounted in the driver’s locker.
When entering it is necessary not only to show the card to the driver but also it is necessary to accompany him with the Opencard in the place intended for it on the side of the Box.
With this, the driver controls the validity of the voucher.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the vouchers, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this information," Drapal added.
Passengers who do not travel on the ring buses and do not remember when the validity of the voucher ends can go to the vending machines where the cards are recharged.
Here, on the machine screen, they will be shown information about the validity of their document.
The Southeast wanted to be part of the U.S. in a referendum
In 1945, the Sudeten Germans demanded that Fumaba become part of the United States.
This is what is extracted from the letter that is kept in the collection of the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want at least to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
With this desire, presumably, some groups of Sudeten Germans addressed the president of the United States in 1945.
It is the result of the letters that are kept in a particular archive and that today are kept in the collection of the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
The Germans of <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> Krumlov ask in a letter to the American president not to allow the return of the "<0xC5><0xA0>umava land" - occupied by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Pact - back to Czechoslovakia.
“We have correctly understood the situation and we really want your word that the American units are coming to German lands not as oppressors or enemies but as liberators,” the letter, signed with a “people who carry the fate of <0xC5><0xA0>umava in their hearts,” reads.
In view of the fact that the union of Czechoslovakia with the south-eastern Germans presumably supposes - according to them the Czech national character - a hope only in brutality, disregard, incomprehension, pressure and slavery, the authors ask in the letter to the American president to assume for today and forever <0xC5><0xA0>umava under a protectorate.
“We cannot believe that without considering the opinion of four million inhabitants we will be handed over to a foreign state that oppresses and rejects minorities and that in no way collaborates with the victory of the allies,” the letter reads.
The reason the authors are unable to sign is presumably fear of reprisals from "Czech oppressors".
If the U.S. president presumably doubted this idea of the <0xC5><0xA1>umavos Germans, it would be enough to organize in the <0xC5><0xA1>umavas lands a referendum on whether its inhabitants want to become part of the U.S. or live under its patronage.
Although the text of the letter, with the current knowledge of post-war history, may sound a little childish, according to some specialists it accurately paints the expectations of the Germans of the southeast of the time.
Although the Czech Germans had little inkling that it was going to be about their expulsion from the republic, only a few admitted this possibility.
Some hoped that the United States and Britain would negotiate for the Sudetenland some clear form of autonomy.
Others thought they would stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed even by the Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice.
He was in the war, as Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice's German, enlisted in the Baltic Navy.
When at the end of the war he was captured by the British and placed in the Holstein prison camp dozens of Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that when they came home, the Czech would be good for them," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners who lived before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, counted on that on the basis of the Benes Decrees they would be removed from the Republic.
You don't think - you pay!
Emotional campaign attacks on drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
In this way we could characterize the emotional Campaign that the Ministry of Transport decided to launch on Wednesday in the media.
Minister Ale<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0x98>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek’s office promises that it will deter drivers from dangerous driving behaviour.
The $150 million campaign will be felt on television, radio, film, the internet and in brochures.
It would have to dissuade the driver from high speed and alcohol at the wheel.
And also to remind you to fasten your seat belts before starting.
It wants to reach the consciousness above all of young drivers, motorists, pedestrians and lastly also of professional drivers.
And what can we see in the ads?
Fundamentally human stories that impinge on emotions.
And for this we are witnessed by the "bloody" ads throughout the campaign:
You don't think - you pay!
The word "Don't think" is written in large letters on the license plate.
And in a pool of blood is the word "pays."
This should symbolize that man in a moment of misguidance can come to pay with his own life.
The ads are going to "fear-monger" viewers through 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by the campaign carried out in Anglo-Saxon lands where strong images of accident victims can be seen.
It promises to reduce accidents and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The ads have been developed by the agency Euro RSCG.
Sugar and whip for drivers
“For drivers, the sugar and whip system is worth it.
Sugar is for him when, for example, he passes a red light and thus saves time.
The whip is a threat of a fine or an accident.
Drivers should be reminded of the risks,” says Na Homolce hospital transport psychologist Martin Ko<0xC5><0x99>án.
And that is why it is necessary an information campaign in the press and mainly a negative publicity, specifies the psychologist.
Less effective, for him, are the panels that warn the driver of the dangers.
"If there is a panel installed warning of some danger it will probably soon merge with the environment and the driver will not pay more attention to it," Ko<0xC5><0x99>án warned.
Olmert would return almost all occupied areas in exchange for peace
The president of the provisional government of Israel, Ehud Olmert, pronounced on the restitution of practically all the lands occupied in 1967, that is, the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He proposed in the interview that he appeared Monday in the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians which means that we will necessarily have to restore almost all the land if not all of it," Olmert told the newspaper.
“We will certainly keep a few percent of these lands, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar percent (of Israel’s lands) because without this there will be no peace,” he added.
He admitted that in case of restitution East Jerusalem would also be included.
“Whoever wants security in Jerusalem and therefore doesn’t want tractors or excavators to pass over his legs as happened to one of my best friends, then he will have to hand over a part of Jerusalem,” Olmert said, referring to the two July attacks in the city in which several people were killed and dozens injured.
According to the president, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Hill, a sacred and historical place" that is located inside the ancient city.
“Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This won’t work,” he insisted later.
Withdrawal from the Golan Heights
Olmert also called for Israel’s withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which in his view is an inherent condition for concluding a peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also require concrete efforts on the part of Damascus.
“I do not propose to close the peace with Syria solely on the basis of the withdrawal from the Golan,” he said.
"The Syrians know well what they will have to part with to win the Golan.
They must abandon their current relations with Iran, they must abandon their relations with Hezbollah (the cheetah movement), they must detach themselves from the permanent support provoked by the terrorism of Hamas (the cheetah movement), Al Qaeda (the terrorist network) and Jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq.
Questions after the accident: Are flight attendants illegal on buses?
The law is unknown, you can't walk on a long-distance bus
In relation to the tragic accident of the bus of the Student Agency company near the Italian city of Padova, the question arises whether the hostesses and passengers can move around the bus during the trip.
“If we wanted to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of the stewardess is opposed to the road traffic law,” said Karel Hanzelka, a spokesman for the transport ministry.
The accident in which the twenty-two-year-old flight attendant died last week was evidently caused by the truck driver only for the bus to cross the road.
The girl, unfortunately, was sitting next to the driver in the least safe place in the vehicle despite having booked two other places.
However, the bus may have an accident or brake suddenly, and at the precise moment the steward delivers the coffee or newspapers.
Here what plays the role is if the bus is equipped, according to the technical permission, with walking places.
If the bus is not approved, the passenger must be seated.
Student Agency’s long-distance buses have no places to stand, company director Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura confirmed to Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
"We have solved this with the ministry and, in principle, the movement of passengers is not allowed.
Finally this was removed and we agreed that passengers can go to the bathroom while the bus is running if they have a seat," he said.
The stewardess does not know the law
“There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of the stewardess – no legal provision clarifies this function.
There is not even a legal provision prohibiting transport agents from performing any service.
The road transport law only knows the term Vehicle Reviewer, whose rights and obligations are not defined," adds, less sharply, spokesman Hanzelka.
Josef Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, director of the Ministry of Transport’s Department of Road Vehicle Traffic, believes that the law sufficiently addresses this issue.
"It depends on whether the bus has the homologation allowed to have walking sites.
That's it," he says.
Buses are divided between urban, where there are places to stand and limited maximum speed, intercity with places to stand with a higher speed permit and long distances without places to stand, with the highest speed permit and with seats equipped with seat belts.
As on the plane, says the expert
BESIP Transport Safety expert Jaroslav Ho<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>n sees no major problems with the movement of the steward on the bus.
"During the development of the trip there is not much threat of danger, the situation can be compared with the service on the planes.
Not even here you can be sure that the turbulence will come and that the flight attendant will be able to hit herself on the head.”
"However, if the bus suddenly brakes, it is obvious that the physical laws are valid.
The same as on a city bus or tram.
The safety of the stewardess must be solved by the internal regulations of the carrier," he says and also thinks that from the point of view of the law this problem is unresolved.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura is ready to cancel this service
Student Agency is the only carrier that offers the service of hostesses.
He employs two hundred in it.
The director, not even after the accident, considers that work risky.
"However, the moment I get the impression that the post of stewardess is risky, then I will remove it.
Coffee and newspapers can receive you, the passengers, upon entering.
It would even save expenses,” he says.
In the interest of safety is the reason why Asiana lacks hostesses in its vehicles, according to Alexej Litvin, who runs a small line compared to SA.
“We don’t have flight attendants, we are against them from the beginning.
Sooner or later this will end in a fatal accident," he told T<0xC3><0xBD>den.cz less than a year ago.
There was a huge tragedy
In the accident of the line connecting Naples died a young stewardess from Pilsen who had worked for the company for two years.
A Slovenian truck that probably turned from the parking lane blocking the way to the bus.
Its driver tried in a quick maneuver to avoid it, however, collided with the right front.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura denies that the two sites that are reserved for the flight attendant’s rest were sold.
"These sites can't be reserved for long-distance connections, they're blocked."
The company intends to sue the truck driver.
The agency will not wait for the verdict of the trial on the compensation of the girl's family but expects the financial expenses also on the part of the culprit.
Reform of the law?
No, for now
The reform of the law could bring greater precision on the movement of the stewardess on the bus in which for a year they are working thirty experts members of a group of the Ministry of Transport.
“However, they have not reached any concrete conclusions.
They are not too dedicated to buses, but rather to the system of points, maximum speed on the highway and the use of the mobile during the march, "says the expert Ho<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>n.
“The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the flight attendants to be something that significantly threatens the safety of passengers,” Hanzelka said, adding that police and the Office of Safety at Work are responsible for monitoring bus safety.
The hope of Dusseldorf rests in Frankfurt
In the letter of the board of directors of the bank West LB for its collaborators there are no shortage of big words.
By the merger of the units of the bank of Dusseldorf with the bank DEKA it is possible to form <0x60>a central market of capitals of the financial group of Sparkassen', as it says in the letter, published on Monday
Bank West LB, breaking the <0xC2><0xAB>block of competition<0xC2><0xBB> with sustainable profit capacity would enter such a business.
In addition, such a merger can be a start for further mergers in the area of regional banks.
This is how he comes to understand the text, when a board of directors wants to show ability to act in hard times.
Because as before, the West LB is under enormous pressure.
Not only on the part of the European Union, but also on the part of the Federal Institute for Surveillance of Financial Services, which has recently made it clear to the government of North Rhine-Westphalia that there is little time left to find a solution.
For some time now, there has also been a lot of talk on the part of Frankfurt about such a union between DEKA, which Sparkasse’s clients know by its investment funds, and West LB.
To tell the truth, Franz Waas, the head of the DEKA bank, presenting the data after half a year at the end of August let it be known that he does not see any sense in the merger of the bank, located on Mainzer Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e, with a regional bank such as Helaba or West LB.
But the board of directors of DEKA, which is now made up of the regional banks and Sparkassen associations, instructed the board to start negotiations with West LB on common business activities.
In this it could be a business in the capital market or parts of it.
Of course, negotiations have just begun, so it says on the financial site.
It is not the first time when it comes to the consolidation in the field of Sparkassen appears the name of the bank DEKA that with its 3000 collaborators is among the most important entrepreneurs in the financial site Frankfurt.
In 2003 at one point the situation seemed so that DEKA bank could merge with the regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate and with Helaba.
This initiative to create a three-party union was unsuccessful.
As soon as the plans were made public, the Hessen government spoke out against Helaba’s involvement in this project.
The other two banks also did not find the same language.
Instead, the regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate began dialogue with the regional bank of Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg.
But it was always played again with the idea of merging DEKA bank with other regional banks.
But ultimately G<0xC3><0xBC>nther Merl, the chairman of Helaba’s board of directors, said he was against plans for coexistence with his bank.
Regardless of that it seems to be clearer that the union of the different banks in the public law area is necessary.
Well, when the Bavarian parliamentary elections are going to pass, the union of BayernLB with the regional bank of Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg could make progress.
For Helaba, this is not necessarily good news.
If the pressure to keep merging increases, Helaba will lack the partners to accomplish that.
In the south the bank could be just a young partner, although so far it has stood out much better from the financial crisis than did the properties in Stuttgart and Munich.
On the other hand the Sparkassen - und Giroverband of Hesse-Turingia, which owns 85 percent of the Helaba, at the beginning of the year avoided coexistence plans with the West LB.
In any case, only the Nord LB remains.
But such geostrategic reflections form are only one part.
On the other hand, it is about the compatibility of the different banking models.
In June Merl asked a fundamental question about a business model that could guarantee the future for regional banks, to which the Deutsche Sparkassen- und Giro-Verband has so far given no answer.
In the end you can break down the West LB, but that, of course, is not the bank’s own desire.
Thus, also in the letter of the board of directors of the bank it is said that an attempt would be made to find a complete solution for the entire bank.
As the coexistence between singular parts of the bank and the DEKA can be reconciled, that will show the time.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as "the weekend of the Italians"
For Elena it is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time, he is assisted by Elena as his girlfriend, and that’s why everything seems different, he says.
Behind them, next to a 5-litre keg of Kaiser brand beer is built a huge tiger bear that shows almost 200 Oktoberfest participants what low sounds he can produce in his throat.
First Elena gives Luca a pat, then a kiss.
From Bologna they arrived in Verona.
From there, from the parking lot next to the Porta Nuova train station, tonight at 23:45 three buses leave, <0x60>in the direction of Munich, the beer party', predictable arrival at 6:30 in the morning.
Three buses are planned especially for Italians, one bus is only for Brazilians.
In one of the corners of the parking lot next to their flag the South Americans are singing, they had already begun to celebrate at night.
With a lot of noise, says Marco Guarda, which is nothing for the Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with an artificial leather lining and glasses with silver colored temples, owns these buses.
For five years they have been coming to Oktoberfest, considering that only this year there are three excursions.
At night on the way there, during the day in the meadow, at 22.30 the turn.
Spending the night there means only unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome reception with a Kaiser beer that was made according to the law of purity of Bavaria, sickness insurance and the guide in German- Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt.
At night the buses are already on the way on the highway with the direction "Brennero"
No beer, not yet.
Quickly tranquility reigns on the bus, travelers are sleeping.
That's fine, they'll still need the strength.
It stops at Brixen and Holzkirchen, where other buses with Italian license plates take another break on Highway 8 just before Munich.
Finally, when Marco’s group has the scheduled arrival at 6.30 am in the car park next to the Prado de Teresa, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others meet, Marco has his last speech on the way to proceed.
First, put on a yellow cap.
There, on the left side is written "Oktoberfest", next in gothic letter is the page of Marco's travel office on the internet: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: “When the doors of the campaign tent open, that means march!” screams Marco at dawn.
"March!" March and occupy the back seats in the campaign tent.
"Don't take the front seats, because we're going to block, and all of you in yellow caps don't sit on the same bench, scattered all over the space!"
A liter of beer, roars Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
Don't forget the tip
Show the security people that we have a good tone!
As soon as he gets out of his place, he'll be busy!"
Third: "This afternoon at exactly half past ten you have to get here!" Do you understand?
And now everyone's going to Oktoberfest.
One, to mark the way, ties yellow caps on trees, road signs and even on an election poster of a large Bavarian People's Party.
We want to be able to recognize the way back.
It is the second weekend of Oktoberfest which is known as "the weekend of the Italians"
There are no exact data on the number of people; it is 50,000 people who make the trip over the Alps and stormingly enter the tents, 10 percent of all came especially this weekend from Italy.
The Munich police receive help from seven policemen of the Autonomous Province of Bolzano, Italian volunteers help the Bavarian Red Cross that makes a statistic of the nations present, where the Italians, with more than 200 medical assistance, in front of the English (about 60 assists) and the Austrians occupy the first place.
The favorite tent of the Italian campaign is thus called Hofbr<0xC3><0xA4>uzelt.
The Sleepless Nights for Hypo Real Estate Creditors
Germany’s banking system is relatively stable, Federal Finance Minister Peter Steinbr<0xC3><0xBC>ck stressed just last week.
How nice, that the politician used the word "relatively" and added that the German banking environment will also be affected by critical trends.
And that happened after the weekend.
Hypo Real Estate (HRE), the Munich real estate financier, which is listed on the DAX index, receives a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to be able to withstand market turmoil.
On Monday, a person familiar with the situation told Reuters: Credit aid amounted to up to 35 billion euros.
The part of the capital that the Hypo Real Estate is going to use has to yield interest.
The money comes from private banks as well as from public banks.
The cause of that is the losses of the subsidiary Depfa.
According to one report, the state financiers with the money that was lent for the long-term projects financed them only for a short period – which now, because of mistrust in the markets, is no longer possible.
In the first half of the year the cash bank’s capital reserve has fallen by 95 percent, 2.37 million euros, also the share of equity was slightly delayed from 1.6 percent to 1.45 percent.
Compared with the same period last year, continued financial investment income and net profits from financial operations fell to zero, imputation income for debtors and some securities also those from the dissolution of provisions of credit businesses tended to fall by more than 70 percent, by 5 million euros.
Only thanks to the high and high income of the reimbursements of the compensation expenses of the restructuring of the former Depfa group as well as the reimbursement of interest according to the federal tax code and the businesses organized for the companies of the consortium, the negative balance could accuse a deficit with approximately 16 percent more.
After its privatization in 1990 the former state financier was initially lost in speculation with industrial loans for real estate, which served as a reason for the founding of the Aareal bank.
As much money could not be made from financing state projects, Defa began to focus intensively on infrastructure projects and the financing of community projects by private and state investors (Private-Public-Partnership PPPs) and diversified.
Now the Hypo Real Estate has to make amortizations on the value of the subsidiary that will have an "essential material effect" on the consolidated profit and loss account of the group, it says very imprecisely.
It is a fact that they have canceled the dividends.
By 2007, they had been cancelled by two-thirds.
After the acquisition of Depfa, Hypo Real Estate became a major state and financial player in the infrastructure sector.
As the bank does not own client deposits, it, compared to other banks, turns out to be more dependent on refinancing in the interbank market.
With the bankruptcy of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers, which happened two weeks ago, the granting of interbank loans fell essentially because the banks were saving their liquidity.
Every year Hypo Real Estate needs nearly 50 billion euros to finance a portion of Defa’s credit portfolios from its short-term refinancing measures.
According to the report of the Hypo Real Estate, the bank covers with a credit the need for financing of the group for a short time and the company is assured of "the influence of international money markets that are now essentially unfit to operate"
Other sources say that thanks to this money the refinancing is guaranteed until the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, chairman of the board of Hypo Real Estate, explained that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not need the money markets for the foreseeable time.
The German central bank and the Federal Institute for the Supervision of Financial Services (BaFin) start from the basis that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group from now on is assured.
That’s what the bank’s shareholders and creditors have to expect.
But because of the dynamics and weightlessness of the crisis there is no record.
It is even imaginable that there is no need for financing in its full volume.
But the opposite cannot be excluded.
There was a rumor that in the last hour of Sunday the bank was still almost insolvent, so the temporary salvation can not reassure at least worried people.
The share price fell to 75 percent, 3.30 euros.
Borrowing courses, on the other hand, are really good.
While the priority debts almost do not change, the courses of the loans according to the position in the registration of the property clearly tend to the downside.
Especially affected are the loans of the former subsidiary W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg Hypo and with good reason the loans whose maturities exceed 2009.
After the remarkable growth of the banking crisis and the acquisition of Depfa that affected the Hypo Real Estate, the current value of its loans that were previously an investment for speculation must be considered as dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
While issuing banks, governments and banks that are little affected are still ready to support the system, in the meantime you can start amortizing pensions on time.
Or something is going to happen, which no one risks imagining – the financial crisis is going to get over in the next 15 months.
But seeing the cross-news about partial nationalization, now the security that is already at its limit has become a justified hope.
That’s going to be a reason, because creditors will spend sleepless nights, breaking their heads over the decision about their isolation of enthusiasm.
Still short-term investors can put an end to and use the carry-over of losses for future benefit indemnity tax payments on change in the future.
Sylvana and the Secrets of the Bent?
When the first day Sylvana Hiltrop, a 16-year-old girl, had to show up at the Tachibana High School the girls started laughing: The German girl is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word Mangas - in a report on the exchanges she tells Japan.
"The first day at a school in Japan.
I felt nervous.
Before I went to school, I was scared.
I live on the edge of Tokyo in the Kawasaki direction and I go by train 40 minutes to Tachibana Highschool.
I just had to find my way, luckily I didn't get lost.
It seems that the beginning of the classes is not set as rigorously as in my house, in Lower Saxony.
From eight in the morning the students come, at nine minus twenty begins a small meeting with the teachers, the 'home room'.
Before class started, I had to introduce myself.
I am also not a person who speaks with pleasure in public, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
As they still have the school uniform I wore an old skirt of the mother of my host family and also a blouse, blue socks and black leather shoes.
Well, dressed like that, I put myself in the pulpit and tried to pronounce everything correctly: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..." - my name is Sylvana, I'm from Germany and in a week it will be my birthday.
At this moment I was very happy because I had already started studying this language two years ago.
All 31 girls in the class have whispered, laughed and waved and all the time I have heard the word "kawaii"
I already knew her from my Mangas.
That belongs to the survival vocabulary of Japanese girls and means "monkey, cute"
Then I quickly slipped into my seat.
The girl next door had a big smile, for her it was an honor that the exchange girl had to sit next to her.
The rest of the class was pretty quiet, but when the gong sounded, I felt really assaulted.
They all spoke at the same time, laughed and asked a lot of questions - at the same time it is very difficult to understand Japanese English.
Then, at recess, they all took out their bentos.
The mother of my host family also made a Lanchbox for me - it's something other than boring German bread pieces.
It had rice with herbs, small sausages, cucumber and seaweed salad, fruit and something like tofu mass meat.
In most cases I have no idea what to do here in Japan.
Things are weird and have a new taste.
What is certain is that everything is very rich.
Well, maybe with the exception of plums marinated in salt, buff!
In Japanese schools, bentos are not just a lunch.
Sometimes it happens that a girl prepares a bento made in a very artistic way for a boy and gives it to him in hopes of getting to know him better during a recess.
I read about it in my Manga-Comics.
I’m very curious to see if I can see it here as well.
“Why Japan?” my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to Tokyo to attend school for a year.
Then he would always answer:
"Well, because it fascinates me."
I’ve been reading manga for years.
In order to better understand the comics and the culture, one day I started to study a little Japanese.
For me it was absolutely safe that one day I will travel there.
Also because I have a skinny for tradition and customs.
They have great value here.
On the one hand Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other hand it is a strict, disciplined and traditional country.
As everything is well organized, I still didn’t feel lost here even though Tokyo is the biggest city I’ve ever seen in my life.”
Even rats have feelings.
It is said that a rat or a cockroach feeling danger flees, why is it also afraid?
Joseph Le Doux, the scientist in the field of neurology is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
How can it be controlled if they, behaving in a similar way to us, feel the same?
In an internet magazine called "Edge" for many years the contributions of famous scientists are published.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series the chosen answers to the question What do you think is true without being able to prove it?
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove it until now, although we cannot even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case at least we can expect it because all human brains have the same fundamental configuration.
But as soon as we engage with other species and include the questions about sensation and in general about consciousness, we enter the unknown realm because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same as the other animals: it kills, flees or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, from which some scientists draw conclusions about comparable subjective experience.
Of course I don't think so.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult to infect our subjective experience to that of animals.
First, they almost always include the circuits associated by human consciousness with the lateral prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex (because of their involvement in short memory and executive functions that direct behavior).
This broad part is much more developed in the case of people than that of other primates and seems to be absolutely missing in other creatures.
Considering at least the aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex, including knowledge about who we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is a reason to assume that even man is different from other primates.
Another peculiarity lies in the linguistic nature of man: As most of his experience is united with language, it often means that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals can be excluded.
But even if consciousness did not depend on language, it would influence it so that the consciousness of animals, created at any rate, would in many cases differ from most of our states of consciousness.
This is why it is difficult to explain how the consciousness of other animals works.
If that, as something interesting and subjective, is not measured because it has the special hardware, nor is it analyzed through our experiences, then their research presents us with big problems.
Most of my interventions concern the content of conscious experience, but at the same time there is also another aspect of consciousness that would have to be easier for scientific investigations.
One could investigate the consciousness processes of animals without considering their contents, and that is what happens during primate short-memory studies, especially in the example of visualization.
But with this approach that Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed, the essential thing happens rather to the neutral correlates of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: The two can be similar or not.
Interestingly this approach highlights the importance of the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex for visualisation formation.
And what happens to the sensations?
I owe it to the fact that in the emotional system a part of the brain that is responsible for that is activated, just as it is with fear.
What we describe as fear is therefore a state of mind in which we are when the activity of the brain occupies a space of the defense system (or its consequences such as for example the reactions of the body).
Seen from this point of view the sensations are very fixed to part of the cerebral cortex what distinguishes primates and especially man.
From the point of view of linguistic nature fine sensation classifications follow because we can differentiate and classify states with the help of words and grammar to be able to describe the states of others on par with ourselves.
For example Antonio Damasco, on the other hand, thinks that the sensations derive from the simple activities of the parts of the cerebral cortex responsible for bodily feelings and the brainstem, the same thinks Jaak Pankseep, but he concentrates more on the brainstem.
As this network has not changed much during human evolution, it can absolutely refer to different types and their sensations.
For theoretical reasons I can’t go against that, but I consider it unlikely.
Pakseep argues that what rats and men feel as fear, possibly that feels in two cases as well: But how can you control whether rats and men behaving similarly feel the same?
Seeing the danger, a cockroach flees, because it is afraid?
I am of the opinion that the similarity of behavior does not yet prove the similarity of experience.
That is true that the neural comparison helps: rats and men have similar brainstems, cockroaches on the contrary do not have at least one brain.
Is it the brain stem that is responsible for sensations?
Even if it is possible to test it for men: How can it be tested in case of rats?
I think rats and other mammals, possibly also cockroaches (who knows?), have sensations.
But I don't know how you can prove it.
I prefer to investigate emotional behavior of rats than emotional sensations because their sensations are supposedly fundamentally distinguishable from us (because human consciousness refers to special circuits and language).
In any case, progress in the field of neurology is expected here, as long as the same is measured for rats and men.
As I do not investigate the language and consciousness of rats, as well as sensations, I do not know if they exist.
It can be said that I do not see beyond my nose, but I prefer to move forward than to work permanently without results.
Well, I'm a practical emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Iwan Wasjunik, the deputy prime minister, said the preparations would soon be carried out under the direct responsibility of the president and the prime minister.
"The government sees UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as proof of confidence in Ukraine's ability to organise the European championship together with Poland," Wasjunik said.
“But that’s not an amnesty for our country.
Now the work is about to begin and there is much to be done in both countries."
The schedule of construction and reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports in the host countries is lame.
The number of stadiums is likely to be reduced from eight to six.
“We can’t waste any more time.
Now we have to carry out work with great speed," said the president of an association Ukraine Grigorij Surkis.
"UEFA is not going to take their eyes off us."
In Poland a more radical step was agreed.
After numerous scandals the Polish Olympic Committee suspended the management of the Polish association PZPN and replaced it with the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of Sport Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is "a serious danger that the PZPN is not able to follow the rules," Drzewiecki told Poland's PAP news agency.
"In a letter we have assured UEFA President Platini that preparation for the 2012 European Championship will not suffer from that."
Only in the last season many clubs of the first division were condemned because of downward manipulation to the lower category, finally also the division council had to be postponed.
Dennis Quaid counterattack outraged
She wanted to promote a new movie, talked in an interview about private life – and has problems with her ex-husband: Hollywood star Meg Ryan designated her ex-husband as an adulterer.
He gets angry and counterattacks.
The late war of the two roses in the ex-partner of Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: eight years after their divorce the two Hollywood actors publicly show an unpleasant fight between them.
Last week in an interview with InStyle magazine, Meg Ryan spoke out for the first time about the reasons for the marriage failure: “Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful.”
She knew the size of her infidelity only after divorce.
The reason for the revelation of private things was Ryan's work with the press for his new film "The Women" - a story of the failure of a marriage is told.
Dennis Quaid’s reaction to the appointment of him as an unfaithful husband was clear: This is “unheard of for Meg to tell the stories of our relationship in another version,” the 54-year-old man told the New York Daily News.
Among other things, it is very "regrettable" that Jack, her 16-year-old son, will again "publicly remember the pain and changes, all that a divorce means to a child."
While Ryan after divorce lives alone, Quaid is remarried and is recently the father of twins.
And so he ends his statements by highlighting: "Whatever my life continues.
I feel happy because I have a wonderful family that is fine."
Prices of airline and hotel tickets are going down
In the first half of 2008 airline tickets and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper compared to last year.
According to a current study, plane tickets in Germany became cheap even up to 50 percent.
Airline tickets and hotel overnight stays became cheap again - this is the result of a study of the provider of travel services and financial services of American Express.
The company has analyzed its reservation data for the first half of 2008 and after the increase in prices in the first quarter found a big change in the second half.
After prices in the hotel market continued to rise for many years, overnight stays in many places became cheap.
Compared to last year, between January and March prices in 41 of the 48 different cities in Europe increased on average to 6.9 per cent.
From April to June, prices have already fallen to 3.6 percent compared to last year.
The trends were most noticeable in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay less than the previous year.
According to American Express, the reason for that was the weakened dollar rate, which was the cause that “the interests of American tourists in traveling declined.”
The decline in hotel prices is also much more noticeable in financial centres such as Frankfurt or London than in industrial hotspots such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices rose to 26.3 percent, breaking a record in Europe.
In the first quarter, air ticket prices also showed upward trends:
Because of the increase in kerosene prices, Economy class travelers had to pay on average 7.1 percent more than in 2007, long-haul flights even became more expensive at up to 29.2 percent.
From April to June, the prices of airline tickets in the Economy class, compared to the previous quarter, fell on average to 12.5 percent, but the price changes for the Businessclass and Firstclass were small.
In Germany the change in prices was more noticeable than in other European countries:
From January to February prices rose to 11.9, in the second half they fell to 23.6 percent.
According to one study, prices for domestic flights in Germany even halved.
The cause of the change in prices is on the one hand the increase of the loose economy, explains the company.
In many parts of the air travel market, demand is falling.
On the other hand there is great competition for the Open-Skies treaty that liberalizes aircraft traffic between the US and Europe.
The sign of the tense situation is the cancellation of flights of non-profit distance in airlines, as well as a large number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 declared bankruptcy - in Europe alone there were 24 airlines.
HSV wins against Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods the SV Hamburg becomes the leader.
Luhukay from Borussia to him still does not come out to make the eleventh goal first.
Kristoffer Klein very well presented the forced landing of national team player Marko Martin.
The Gladbach player started playing late and failed to score a goal.
Everything he wanted to say exactly by reacting to what happened could be clearly read from his lips.
I just knew he was right.
"We need a second goal," whistled Hermann Rieger in the cockpit entrance of Hamburg's stadium.
Nothing special happened in the catacombs, the rest time ended and most of those present were back in their places.
Rieger was for almost three decades a physiotherapist of the HSV, enjoys a very high reputation as one of those who formed a part of the group.
That's why his request was noted by a responsible person.
Cornelius Jol the assistant coach nodded and raised his fingers in sign of assent.
Cornelius is the brother of Martin Jol, Hamburg's head coach.
His order was the same: Wow, the second goal!
But that was not done.
“Today not everything was nice to see,” Marcell Jansen later added.
Also Bastian Reinhard had wished to have it "more relaxed".
The result 1:0 (1:0) Hamburg have to thank Mladen Petric (11) with his head impact; and also to the situation that the very weak Gladbach team could not show all its strength to the weak Hamburg team.
“That was a dirty win,” Martin Jol said.
On Monday, the SV Hamburg will turn 121 years old.
On Saturday it will be the spectators had already celebrated their own, the blue sky over the stadium and the change of board on the video screen.
It's going to be a birthday without a real party.
“We know how to interpret it,” Marcell Jansen said.
He foresees that the partial ratings of the table correspond more to the speed of the league than to the dominance of his HSV.
The team with its late forced players like the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the scorer Petric as well as Jansen who was removed from FC Bayern need time to get together, but still the team can not shine with their successes.
“We need more feeling and dribbling,” Jol demands.
After the defeat of voting
Fear is spreading on Wall Street.
The first news about the failure of the rescue package of the banks dropped a certain period the Down Jones to 700 points.
That was the biggest loss of points for a day in its history.
The Dow Jones rebounded a bit.
At about 8:30 p.m., one of the world’s most important stock market barometers traded a 5 percent deficit of 10,579 units.
The Nasdaq, the electronic stock market, lost more than seven percent to 1,548 points.
At this time the biggest losers in the Dow Jones were American Express which lost almost 14 percent and Bank of America with a loss of almost 12 percent.
No title could gain in value.
Goldman Sachs shares were down nearly 10 percent.
Only a few days ago a large investor Warren Buffet had participated financially in the company.
The plan of salvation envisages making available resources to buy so-called “rotten” mortgage shares.
But the sum will be paid at once but step by step.
As compensation for that, the state has to receive the stock option receipts for the financial associations that during the course development can be charged to reduce the financial burden of the state’s cash.
Stock prices in Europe and the U.S. continue to fall
The billion-dollar bailouts for banks in Europe and the U.S. do not reassure investors.
The course of the shares of the big German bank Hypo Real Estate goes down and negatively influences the Dax.
Despite the salvation of the financial market projected by the state, the US Dow Jones index continues to fall.
The losses of the Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank stocks caused the German index (Dax) to fall into a large deficit.
Despite rescue actions on the part of the federal government and private banks, the action of the Munich real estate financier over a period of time lost two-thirds of its value, the Comerzbank lost more than 20 percent.
The Dax fell clearly below the 6,000-point psychological limit and traded a 3.7 percent deficit on 5,839 units.
Across the world, financial markets fell.
The opening of Wall Street’s day in New York began with notable losses.
Investors fear the US government’s $700 billion bailout package will not be enough to boost financial markets.
In the first hour after the opening, the Dow lost 334 points, or 3.3 percent, to 10,809.25.
The House of Representatives of the United States wanted to vote on the draft salvation, the vote in the Senate can be the first of October.
Also the other European balls knew only one trend: at the beginning the FTSE index in London lost 3.2 percent, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia the Japanese Nikkei main index after profits fell to 1.26 percent at 11,743.61.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index fell 2.1 percent to 18,286.90.
In India, the main Sensex index lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent to close at 12,595.75.
After the announcement of the capital increase, Arcandor shares lost on the MDax.
Private bank Sal. Oppenheim underwritten 23 million new shares.
In addition, the commercial and tourism consortium announced that the stakes in the company Thoms Cook will not be sold.
Dark matter influences the trajectory of space probes
For many years a mysterious phenomenon has puzzled researchers: Dark Matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called gravitational assistance to the maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s Theory of Relativity may not be as correct.
The space probe “Ulysses” spent almost 18 years flying in the universe.
Because the fuel pipes are freezing now threatens him a death in the cold.
For years a mysterious phenomenon, the anomaly during the gravitational assistance to the maneuver, causes bewilderment among researchers.
Gravitational assistance is a maneuver of the trajectory of space probes during which they obtain an acceleration using the energy of the gravitational field of a planet, for example Earth.
That allows space probes to save fuel.
Cassini-Huygens, the European-American space probe used this physical trick just as the Ulysses Sun probe did.
But what surprised researchers for many years: Missiles do not behave 100 percent as expected under the venerable law of gravitation.
Rather they frequent irregularities of speed.
Suddenly the probes have more or less speed.
Physicists could not explain this effect until now.
They called it the anomaly during the gravitational assist to the maneuver.
Some experts fear that possibly even Albert Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity describing the force of attraction of matter by the curvature of space may not be as correct.
Stephen Adler, the American physicist at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, now solemnly believes as before that Einstein did not confuse and tries to explain the anomaly during gravitational assistance with the help of so-called Dark Matter, in what remained of the astronomers in the universe.
“The reason for the anomaly may be dark matter that may also be very close to Earth,” he writes.
Researchers of the universe have only known about the existence of Dark Matter for ten years.
Supposedly she possesses the force of attraction and her influence can be observed on other planets.
Dark Matter, on the contrary, is completely invisible which means that it does not send and does not reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially also no visible light.
According to scientists, dark matter makes up at least one-fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
As Italy’s foreign minister confirmed, after spending ten days in the hands of kidnappers, tourists kidnapped in Egypt must be released.
Sudan’s kidnappers had demanded millions from the rescue.
Six kidnappers must be killed in a shootout during release.
Five Germans are kidnapped in southern Egypt.
The rescue negotiations have already begun.
The Germans always fall back into the kidnappers' spotlight.
The newspaper WELT ONLINE tells about the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are freed.
About that same information presents the Egyptian state television, the Arabic TV station Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
After the news of the release on the Italian broadcaster Sky TG 24 Franco Frattini, Italy’s foreign minister, confirmed the release: “Our fellow citizens and other hostages are released.
"We are now monitoring his health," Frattini said.
Five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian companions are safe and well, Egyptian state television reported.
The 19 participants of the desert expedition are on their way to Cairo.
What is incomprehensible are the reasons for a shooting before the hostages were released: According to the descriptions of an Egyptian security guard, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping, but the Sudanese army had suddenly killed six kidnappers.
“The problem has been solved.
They agreed to the rescue," the guard said.
It was just a matter of “receiving the hostages” when suddenly “this surprise” arrived.
On Sunday, Sudanese soldiers killed six kidnappers and detained two of them in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The kidnappers have demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money had to be given to the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper El Masri El Jom, referring to a German mediator, reported that the release was delayed because the kidnappers were afraid of their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers intend to release the female hostages after they have received the ransom.
The men had to be held until the kidnappers had a safe route to escape.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to take the position on this report.
Father-in-law abuse 'led to suicide'
According to the court, years of abuse by her stepfather led a woman to kill herself.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians in Cornwall, has been sentenced to five years in prison after he admitted eight counts of indecent assault.
The Royal Court of Truro, through an inquiring study, learned that he had regularly tied up his daughter Stephanie Randle, when the girl was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confessional: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court learned that Ms. Randle committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
In the season when the girl lived in Coventry, Trerise used to tie her up and blindfold her before performing her sexual acts, while her mother was working in a pub.
After the divorce in 1980, Trerise returned to live in Cornwall.
His stepdaughter moved to Plymouth.
However, the court learned that Ms. Randle, who spent much of her time volunteering for the National Trust, was tormented by the abuse that had been inflicted on her twice a week.
In 2006, prosecutor Ramsey Quaife referred to the court what some friends of Ms Rande's had said of her, who, having been a great surfer and cyclist, now seemed "emotionally dead," as if she had "renounced life."
In April 2007 his real father, Terrace Randle, found the woman dead in his Plymouth apartment.
Mrs Rande is supposed to have killed herself by suffocating with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter’s stepfather, who wrote a confession letter that concludes by saying, “I used to tie her up and blindfold her.
It was never a sexual assault.
I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen replied to Trerise: "You are a very strange fetishist, and for your victim it must have been a gruesome experience, especially when he was only seven years old.
This unpleasant saga ends with the victim taking his own life.
Even clearer, it’s that if she hadn’t, the issue probably wouldn’t have ended in the courts.”
He added: "I have noticed the effect that according to the description made by Stephanie's father and mother the abuse has had on her daughter over the years.
Clearly she could have had a promising, successful and happy future."
An officer charged with data loss
The BBC has been informed that a Cabinet officer who forgot some secret documents on the train in June will be charged under the Official Secrets Act.
The man, on a working trip by the Ministry of Defence, left two highly classified documents on the train to Waterloo.
The documents were passed on to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
It is certainly the least serious charge under the law and does not imply any indication of intent to commit a crime.
BBC defence correspondent Frank Gardner said the conviction had come as a surprise to many in the British administration.
"They thought it was an internal matter between the Ministry of Defense and the Cabinet," he said.
The employee, who cannot be named, is charged under section 8.1 of the Act, the clause that refers to the safeguarding of information.
The Royal Legal Service said the official should be charged by the Metropolitan Police, because of the highly sensitive entity of his work on the Secret Service Committee.
The forgotten documents contained secret information about al-Qaeda and the capabilities of the security forces in Iraq.
The officer was informed of the decision Monday morning and then transferred from his home to a secret location.
Construction companies face the price of B&B
In Britain, construction companies could face a price tag of more than <0xC2><0xA3>80,000 after the Bradford and Bingley bank bailouts.
The government, in effect, provided <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion to protect the deposits of the bank’s 2.6 million savers.
The interest on the loan will be paid by all companies that use the savers’ money, including the 59 construction companies.
Adrian Coles, CEO of the Construction Societies Association (BSA), said it was “humiliating” that the companies and their members had to pay.
Eventually, the $14 billion loan should be repaid after the Bradford and Bingley mortgages are redeemed.
Interest accrued in the interim, however, is assumed to be charged each year to the 700 financial companies that have deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Plan confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies are included in that number.
It is humiliating that institutions that behaved prudently ... should be called upon to pay today the price of institutions that have been far less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
That is to say that each of the companies had to pay in proportion to the bank deposits, and that the mediation companies had to pay approximately 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will amount to <0xC2><0xA3>450,000 in 2009.
This means that the companies will have to recover <0xC2><0xA3>81,000 to face the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, director general of the Commercial Association of Construction Companies, told the BBC that this situation is unfair.
“It is humiliating that the institutions that behaved prudently in the growth of the real estate market are called upon to pay the price produced by those that were much less prudent.”
According to the BSA, there is no data indicating the failure of any society since 1945.
“We will need to examine all aspects of this matter in the coming weeks to find out what options exist to protect construction companies and their members in the face of what could be a material price,” Mr. Cole added.
Interest earned in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year to March.
In 2010, it will be a full year of interest payable, which can be almost twice as much.
Being mutual building societies organizations and having no shareholders, their members will inevitably end up paying the price, either through higher rates or lower interest on their savings.
The price of milk rises by five pence per liter
The inhabitants of the Jersey stand will have to pay more for their milk.
The Jersey Dairy newspaper has announced that the higher price of dairy products will increase by an extra fivepence per liter from next Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-pence increase in February and following investigations by a consulting firm.
Traders can decide for themselves whether they want to apply the price increases to their customers.
The last time the highest price of milk had risen before February was in 2002.
Former Bangladeshi Prime Minister Denied Bail
A Bangladeshi court has rejected a request for bail for former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, saying she can be taken to jail when she returns home.
His defenders said the court did not grant him bail by charging him with extortion of 50 million taka ($729,700) from a businessman when he was prime minister.
This is one of several allegations of corruption against him.
His long-time political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina’s return to Bangladesh is supposed to be in the coming weeks, but his party, the Awami League, has demanded that the country’s military-backed government first grant him full freedom.
Correspondents say that while she was given parole to go abroad and receive medical treatment, it is unclear now what the terms of her release are or whether she will be able to remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say they will appeal to the Supreme Court against the High Court’s order.
"The Supreme Court rejected Sheikh Hasina's request for bail on the grounds that he could not be granted bail because he was already being treated abroad on parole," said his lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We are filing an appeal against the Supreme Court's order."
Her advocates argued that she needed bail to return home from abroad and prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina should return to his homeland after Oct. 17, an Awami League leader said Sunday.
She was detained last year after the army-backed interim government took power but was released in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia reject all charges against them.
Fears for the campaign against poliomyelitis in Afghanistan
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan – says the UN – have not been able to take advantage of a recent polio vaccination campaign because of Taliban violence.
Last week, the United Nations carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces of the country.
The organization reports that it was unable to reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the South for security reasons.
A U.N. spokesman said it happened despite promises made by the Taliban that they would not have attacked or hindered thousands of officials as they carried out the vaccinations.
BSkyB loses legal challenge at ITV
BSkyB has lost its legal challenge in the Competition Commission after the decision obliging the company to reduce its stake in rival broadcasting ITV.
BSkyB has been informed by the Court of Competition Appeals that it will have to reduce its 17.9% stake in ITV below 7.5%.
Previously, the Commission stated that BSkyB’s interests hindered competition and allowed its unfair influence in ITV.
BSkyB bought its stock package in 2006 in a deal that effectively blocked NTL, now Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Anti-Monopoly Office reported that BSkyB's acquisition of ITV's stake in ITV raised doubts about ITV's independence, and prompted the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
All, including Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and regulator Ofcom opposed the purchase.
BSkyB commented that the obligation to reduce its package in ITV was unreasonable and constituted a disproportionate remedy, particularly because, BSkyB said, it would have surrendered its voting rights.
New Investigation Into the Assumption of U.S. Lawyers
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special counsel to investigate the firing of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006.
The reason was a report in which the Justice Department’s inspector general criticized the actions of administration officials.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was prompted by fears that the lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy is investigating whether officials questioned during the investigation lied to investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice.
“Serious allegations of possible criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or resolved,” Attorney General Glenn Bellas states in the report.
One of the main recommendations of the report was the appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to compel witnesses to leave their statements.
The discussion began when nine U.S. attorneys were removed from their positions by the Justice Department in December 2006.
At the time, the department motivated the decision by suggesting that the lawyers had been fired for poor performance.
But it later emerged that the lawyers had not rated themselves worse than other colleagues, and many observers concluded that the dismissals would be politically motivated.
Some of the lawyers in question had worked on the prosecution of high-profile Republicans in Congress, while others had refused to investigate allegations of election fraud against Democrats.
These lawyers investigate and prosecute court cases for the government
They can be fired at any time, but not removed for political reasons.
The subsequent head of the Justice Department, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, under pressure from the firings, resigned from his position.
A number of other Justice Department officials did the same.
The Attorney General’s report is highly critical of Mr. Gonzales’ role in the matter, and underscores how he had a “primary responsibility” for the layoffs, which he “abdicated” from his leadership position and was “remarkably uncooperative” in the process.
Other officials, including Karl Rove, Bush’s former aide, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
The Meat Loaf Epic of Much Honor
Rock star Meat Loaf will be honored at the Q Awards for his epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will pick up the special award next week at the ceremony in London, said getting this recognition will be "an honour".
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, formed the title of the album Meat Loaf triumphed with in 1977.
The Coldplay group are taking nominations for this year’s awards and ranking all four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that transcend time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them."
The song, written by Jim Steinman, requires excellent vocal ability like that used by Meat Loaf.
A nearly two-minute instrumental section opens the anthem.
The song was first known as a single in the United Kingdom in 1979 and peaked at number 15 on the UK Singles Chart.
However, Meat Loaf's Bat Out Of Hell stayed about nine years in the charts and went on to sell over 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf – real name Marvin Lee Aday – has suffered health problems in recent years, including surgery for his cardiac arrhythmia in 2003, after collapsing during a concert.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel some concerts.
It later emerged that he had a cyst on his vocal cord.
Dark city street, often forgotten and perhaps ready for sale
The city of New York has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other roads, some famous, others simply of service.
However, many people, including veteran taxi drivers and long-time local residents, find it difficult to pinpoint the location of the Extra Place, especially since many of them have never heard of this street.
The small street is located in the East Village and extends north of First Street – before I found Second Street – between the Bowery and Second Avenue.
This little street, about 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, resembles a dusty alley more than one active thoroughfare.
There's no sign.
It is virtually impossible to find in an atlas.
The street, however, has admirers.
For example, there’s Avalon Bay, the company that recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
who wants to resurrect Extra Place and create a clean corridor to the shops and boutiques that are expected to open in the new buildings.
Other admirers include longtime neighbors who said they were delighted by the truncated lane simply because it is one of the last remnants of the block’s past before the buildings were appropriated.
However, the city’s Department of Housing, Preservation and Development, which has control of the street, has no interest in owning it.
At the meeting of the Community Committee on Land Use this month, representatives of the Avalon agency outlined a proposal to buy the street.
However, the committee, preferring the street to remain in the city, called for a new plan to be presented next month, as said Susan Stetzer, the district manager of Community #3.
"The city owns very few spaces today and we would like it to continue to own Extra Place," said Ms.
“We can consider the proposals made by Avalon to solve the problem and manage the space, but we also want to ensure public access to the street.”
Avalon Bay had announced several months ago that it wanted to repair the small street and install some seats, including some to be used as coffee, waiting to rent the spaces.
The idea that Avalon could buy the street first came up during this month’s meeting
But Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said that even though the company wanted to use the street, it didn’t necessarily want to own it.
“Avalon Bay’s primary concern is the renovation of this abandoned alley and the possibility of turning it into a public area,” he said, adding that the proposed sale came from the city itself.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Committee for Preservation, confirmed that it was a desire of the city to sell the street and noted that the mission of the agency is the development of the property rather than the management of it.
Compared to its more colorful surroundings, those of the Bowery, Extra Place has left a mark on history.
Some believe it got its name in 1802, when the large estate owned by Philip Minthorne was divided among his sons and this narrow strip of land was claimed by no one.
The back door to the CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened at Extra Place, but the street is perhaps best known for the establishment’s photography that pops out on the cover of Ramones’ “Rocket to Russia” album.
"The environment was magnificent," commented Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who took the picture in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, pieces of clothing and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves, ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers who write about the gentrification of the East Village, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that public goods, however modest, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rare piece, virtually unchanged, a slice of the city that should be guarded.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitle, "The Book of Lamentations: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Going Extinct"), has made available part of a talk about the city's history on Extra Place, published by The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a somewhat narrow, dead-end alleyway, dark also by day and marked by rusty iron warehouse doors and back-windows, with week-old newspapers blown along the gutters."
With few exceptions, the street looked more or less the same on a recent afternoon.
A rat was healing through the back of the street and standing near the door that was used to enter the CBGB and which now houses a luxury clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls and an empty beer bottle of about 22-oz were near a new batch of discarded newspapers.
Some interns said they rarely paid attention to Extra Place, but suggested it could be cleaned up.
Mr. Fields, for his part, noted that some people underestimate the attractive power of the street in its current state.
"I spent the best years of my life," he said, "in dark, damp, disgusting places."
The debate on bilingualism: immersion in the English language
In this chapter of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss candidates’ positions on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a longtime associate in California studies and director of studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of the book “Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice.”
Effectively calling Hispanic voters is a tough business.
The education proposals made by Barack Obama are an example of that.
Mr. Obama’s campaign notes that “African-Americans and Latino students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students,” and this is a very certain consideration.
To combat such differences in learning events, Obama’s education plan specifically advocates, among other things, “transitional bilingual education” for English-students.
However, the open question for Mr. Obama is whether the commitment of bilingual education, which prefers classroom instruction in languages other than English, is effective in nullifying the distance in the final results.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an officially recognized elementary school in the eastern region of Los Angeles County.
In this school the vast majority of students are Hispanic and family with low income:
More than a third of students, many of whom are newcomers, are learning the English language.
However, an incredible 100 percent of fourth-year students have been positively assessed in the 2008 math test.
and nearly an equally staggering 93 percent have mastered the English language and arts test.
This incredible success has been achieved using a different ingredient than that favored by Mr. Obama.
The Sixth Street School emphasizes review and practice, constant assessment of competencies and does not tolerate any attitude of excuses.
Also, and this is where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, the principal of Sixth Street, the school’s focus for English instruction to students is on “total immersion.”
Immersion in English means the almost exclusive use of the language in the treatment of the contents of the instruction.
Ms. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, told me, “We’ve had extraordinary success with students like this one who’s come from Mexico and that, if you walk into the classroom 12 months later, you wouldn’t be able to pick up what was.”
"It works," he said, "we think it works."
Will Mr. Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model to replicate by other schools with large Hispanic-English student populations?
The results achieved by this school should remove any doubt about the answer, but the idea of the politicians of his party on the subject of education (the Associations for National Education have long been advocates of bilingual education) and their same constant support for bilingual education obscured the prediction of Mr. Obama’s response.
While it is that immigrants must learn English, recently Mr. Obama has trivialized the issue by letting people stop worrying about legislation that is only written in English.
and instead, he said, "you should make sure your child can speak Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to improve the system and close loopholes, he should carefully consider the models of education that work well, rather than despise or trivialize them.
Oil prices fall sharply after renewed economic fears
The price of oil fell sharply on Monday because of concerns that the U.S. bailout plan for financial markets may not be able to revive the economy.
Crude oil shares fell 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel in the morning trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The price has fallen by more than $20 per barrel since last Monday.
In the past two weeks, commodity markets have been rocked by the financial crisis on Wall Street and a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After hitting a high of $145.29 a barrel in July, prices had fallen to nearly $90 a barrel earlier this month before receding, once again, because of huge uncertainty in financial markets.
Anxiety gripped investors once again on Monday, despite congressional leaders saying they had reached an agreement over the weekend on the bailout, the largest in history.
The news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis would be far from over.
The developments in the latest episode of the merger process confirm that Citigroup will buy the banking operations of Wachovia Corporation, according to what the government said on Monday.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said that, over the hectic weekend, the negotiations that led to the bailout deal “seem to have failed to rekindle market sentiment.”
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to decline.
“The outlook for global equity, interest and exchange rates is going to be increasingly uncertain,” Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
“We believe that commodities will not be able to escape this contagion.
From a product perspective, our most pressing concern is assessing whether the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China.”
The bank’s analysts have lowered their expectations for next year, as oil consumption falls due to the crisis in economic growth and the forecast for a reduction in the price of oil and gas is 20 percent for 2009.
Second quarter madness: team sets record
Having spent, for the past eight seasons, more time than anyone in the Jets uniform, playing defense, Shaun Ellis thought he had seen it all.
Then he saw how things played out in the second quarter on Sunday, when the Jets turned an unscored game into a deflating game.
"I've never seen anything like that," Ellis said.
The second quarter started after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had played lazily under the bleak clouds.
At this point it happened that quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles making a 12-yard goal and suggesting the perfect omen for an afternoon, in which the relationship evolution between the players took a big leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more goals in the fourth, one of these when a cornerback fell and another came with 10 seconds in half.
"I didn't get out of my way," Favre said of all the steps that went to Coles.
"He's a one-player devil.
Our communication has been great, regardless of what people may think."
While Favre and Coles were at the dam, the Cardinals defense mistreated quarterback Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a walking shot and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith scored another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens was forced into the foul by Warner.
In the last turnover, the fouls forced by Bowens, could have been the best.
The Cardinals had taken possession with 10 seconds available, and after the Jets regained the ball, Jay Feely gave him a 20-yard kick to win a 34-0.
They are the biggest points the Jets have ever made in a quarter.
The team's coach, Eric Mangini, asked him to describe the madness of this moment, said, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
When both were answered - the Jets allowed 21 unanswered points in the third quarter - Mangini said, "I can say I liked the second quarter a lot more than the third quarter.
They’ve won a lot of points in a very short period of time.”
Rested Gebrselassie tops her world record
Ethiopia’s Haile Gebrselassie has proven why he is considered by many to be the greatest runner in history, breaking his own world record at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person capable of running the 26.2 mile race in 2 hours 4 minutes.
After winning the accommodative flat race in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie shattered his previous record of 2:04:26, set last year in Berlin, by 27 seconds.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie has set the 26th world record in a race of impressive length so he has set a world championship or world record for any distance, from the time trial to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie did not take part in the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing - perhaps too alarmingly, in retrospect - that air pollution would aggravate her asthma problems.
Instead, he signed up to race in Berlin.
In practically perfect conditions - sunny and with 48 degrees at the start of the race, 55 degrees at the end - Gebrselassie won this Sunday, using on average a sharp 4 minutes 43 seconds per mile.
Since track runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya have become long-distance runners, the marathon record has been reduced by more than two minutes in the last decade, as Brazil’s Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday’s victory, Gebrselassie told reporters he had suffered calf cramps two weeks earlier and had missed a week of training.
It is evident that the suspension left him fresh, not oxidized.
"I'm very happy," Gebrselassie told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and today I had some doubts, but in the end everything went well."
The athlete has been the subject of some criticism – especially in Kenya, Ethiopia’s Afro-Eastern rival – for the style of over-orchestrating his races, generally avoiding the encounter with many world marathon stars, relying on pacemakers as if it were a race track, and putting records ahead of the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the greatness of Gebrselassie’s skills as a runner.
This Sunday, at the march of four Kenyans, Gebrselassie reached the middle of the race in 1:02:04.
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, started challenging Gebrselassie after his pacemakers slowed.
But just three miles from the finish line, Gebrselassie picked up one last push to part ways with Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his personal best by nearly five minutes.
Kamathi came in third place in 2:07:48.
In the women’s race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan but now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year winning in 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time in history.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, Mikitenko, 36, was a surprise and won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She also did not take part in the Beijing Games for what was described as a back injury, but recovered to win in Berlin and set her personal best record in almost five minutes in the third marathon she ran.
He ran a smart calculation race, letting a quartet of Kenyan and Ethiopian runners do it head-on and then retrieving them after 18 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia won second place in 2:21.31, while Elena Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
In a city apart, pride and the trials of colored life
Hidden by the expansion of the theme park of the great Orlando, a few kilometers from the bright, noisy and colossal city, is a quiet village, where the pride and complications of the African-American experience are very evident.
Eatonville, the first fully black incorporated city in the country and the childhood home of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: “the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 colored men, 300 good swimmers, many guavas, two schools, and not a single jail.”
It is now a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Fair in Eatonville to pay tribute to Mrs. Hurston, Harlem’s most famous Renaissance writer.
And yet, in many ways, the city she described—making it also a tourist stage by including it in the Florida travel guide produced by the Depression Season Federal Writers Project—remains a place apart.
The city remains independent, dignified, and private as it was in the 1930s, when Mrs. Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted sharing their true ideas with the white man, who "knows so little about us that he doesn't know what he's missing."
Even now, in the year that a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, has drawn attention to begin a dialogue on the issue of race, many remain wary in front of the outsider.
“We’re very cautious about the way our story is told,” said Jones Hortense, 59, a lifelong resident and member of the city’s oldest church.
"It has to be right."
Eatonville has always been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is at the same time a historical model of black affirmation and a community of nearly 2,400 people living under a poverty level twice the national average.
It is a literary center, but also a repaired example of the rural culture of the Black South—sometimes disdained, sometimes praised—that was born of slavery in America.
No wonder, if those who reside here are both proud and reserved.
And the concern for Eatonville's image really began with Zora, as no one here calls her Mrs. Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world through her deep dialect books such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida guide transformed the city, just off Route 17, a highway that runs through central Florida often forgotten into black history and human drama.
Faced with cement in both life and literature, Mrs. Hurston took her readers to the store owned by Eatonville’s first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then into more private areas.
"Off the road on the left," he wrote, "is the modern Maroon public school with its white finishes, its well-maintained gardens and playgrounds, cared for by Howard Miller, as he can hardly read and write."
She also mentions the widow Dash's new husband and writes that Glenn Lee "sells drinks of all kinds and anything goes with transient rooms."
Therefore, in just a few hundred words, Mrs. Hurston relates Eatonville to self-government, but also to illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
Evidently, this Fodor did not.
In fact, not everyone appreciated the portrait.
“Zora described it as it was,” said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of the Johnson girls whom Ms. Hurston immortalized by quoting men who were singing colorless songs about their beauty.
He added: "Some people didn't like that."
Ms. Hurston is still remembered here as a vivacious eccentric who returned frequently after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Franklin Augusto, 77, remembers that when Mrs. Hurston arrived in town, she did so without warning in a large Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a city that even today is proud to dress with dignity.
Most residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, while many laughed sarcastically.
“People were always very happy to see Zora,” Mr. Franklin continues.
But, he adds, swinging in his chair in a backyard overlooking Sabelia Lake, where Ms. Hurston was probably baptized, “she never stayed too long.”
When Mrs. Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were no longer in print.
Like most of the world, Eatonville also seemed to have forgotten about her.
Although she was a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only woman of color at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an anonymous grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she had been living.
In Eatonville, there were no major memorial ceremonies, no major public readings.
“I don’t think her contribution to the world or her heritage was understood,” said Valerie Boyd, author of Wrapped in Rainbows, a 2003 biography of Ms. Hurston.
A certain turn came in the '80s.
Orange County officials wanted to put a five-lane highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the labor community’s main two-lane street.
The expansion of the Orlando area had already pushed Interstate 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to his relatively idyllic isolation from the community.
In the 1950s, the struggle for racial mixing brought hatred closer to the community.
“During that season, a bunch of white guys would go around town throwing oranges and everything at the people sitting next to them,” Mr. Franklin said.
“They also killed a girl once.
They threw him at a watermelon in the car."
In a 1955 letter to Mrs. Hurston he wrote to The Orlando Sentinel, criticizing the Supreme Court's forced integration that, in Brown v. Board of Education, "insulted rather than honored my race."
A Residents today say that the desegregation of schools, positive in some respects, had weakened the cohesion of Eatonville and undermined the confidence of its young people.
“Black kids were used to being hugged — I remember this — they used to hug the teacher in the morning and in the evening,” said N.Y. Nathiri, the daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director of Preserve the Eatonville Community, a nonprofit organization.
This lasted, he added, until the teachers and students did not come from the same place.
“I wasn’t hugging your teacher because she was white — there’s a cultural gap there,” Ms. Nathiri said.
Civil rights, however, helped create the space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons – black writers, actors, and artists who went above and beyond prejudices, just as she did, with buoyant, confident lines like, “How can anyone deny himself the pleasure of my company!
I don't understand it."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went to Mrs. Hurston's unmarked grave and began fighting to resurrect her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Mrs. Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway appeared in bookstores, reintroducing her to the American canons.
The road project came just as Eatonville’s most famous daughter was back in the spotlight.
And this time, Mrs. Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
In 1988, the community began planning a fair for Ms. Hurston to show what the county could ruin with that road.
Thousands of fans arrived at the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return for the celebration.
After several years, the county has abandoned its road proposal.
“The resurrected idea of the five-lane highway would have been to put on what you would call the speed of curvature, a real civic pride,” said Ms. Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd put it more simply, "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the road project has helped to change the image of the city itself.
Outsiders such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began coming to church here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and residents began reviewing the past.
Eatonville entered the National Historical Register in 1998.
A new library (named after Hurston, of course) opened in 2006, on a repainted and beautified Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly in Florida: just six miles from downtown Orlando, it can sometimes feel like a street from the past in a summer rain, in a city as small as the one that was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(90 percent of people are black today.)
Outsiders who come in search of Eatonville’s history, of its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
A permission in advance is required to do most interviews, and some things—such as murals in the oldest church in Eatonville, painted by a white man and showing black men working in the field—cannot be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Mrs. Jones, a courageous and convinced teacher who has a weakness for bright red, still fear that her island community might be misinterpreted.
And yet, as the Hurston festival has expanded, a higher level of native pride has also emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville in the same way that Mrs. Hurston saw her entire race: beauty, and all problems, not better, not worse, and equally to the other racial and ethnic groups in America, proud, creative, hardworking, silly, and mixed.
It is a sincere civic sense that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin’s nephew, Edwin Harvey, 18, who is planning to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or by the Police Department, who he said might need some help.
And even those who are younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
“Most people, in case they dare to go all the way here, will have to think, ‘Oh, this city is nothing compared to any other,’” says Alondra Kenon after going to church on a recent Sunday.
“But if you really stop and take a moment to look at its history, it’s a very nice city.”
Around here, in New York, everyone talks about finance routinely.
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the kiosks and giant TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn’t realize they were in the eye of the hurricane.
They could never imagine that behind the glass facade of the honeycomb offices that lie above their heads, the bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York face daily the worst “bad office day” since the 1929 slump.
Guys for home delivery keep resonating their metal tea carts across the sidewalks and carrying trays of muffins for breakfast meetings.
Latino men continue to crawl between loaded apartment buildings, just like human mules, with 50 shirts of eccentric embossing hanging from a yoke across their shoulders. Office workers still wait in line for their morning takeout, and it remains impossible to catch a taxi between 4 and 7 p.m. on work days.
Employees still wait in line for their bagel at the vendors’ carts, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between four and five o’clock in the afternoon on weekdays.
It seemed to me as if there was no crisis at all, until, this Thursday afternoon, with all the pessimistic forecasts there are, I decided to open a new savings account.
Although I had calculated the time needed for the operation to coincide with the late-afternoon calm at my local JP Morgan Chase affiliate, a queue of about 20 people was already waiting.
And not in front of the employee’s window, to withdraw their cash or make a deposit, but in front of the customer service bank, where lifelong customers order their checkbooks, tourists seek instructions to go to Macy’s department store and new customers want to open their accounts.
Most of these people preceded me, I was informed later by Starr, my “trusted personal banker,” and were in line for the same reason I was.
Unlike me, they had already withdrawn their savings from the smaller banks in places from where they had switched, places like New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They had taken their money from so-called savings associations (a bit like a construction company), credit unions and savings banks in their hometown whose branches only function within the state of belonging, and which claim to treat customers as their family.
Over the past year, 15 of these banks have quietly failed.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, went bankrupt, and as New Yorkers headed home Friday night for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, with $440 billion in savings deposits, was looking for a rescue buyer.
The office and store workers standing in front of me, fearing another collapse, were transferring their money to a bank to what is considered a safe haven, which is doing most of the bailouts on Wall Street.
Ordinary New Yorkers have become financial experts in recent weeks.
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone, was referring to Lehman Brothers, the failed bank, and its distressed-looking CEO, Dick Fuld, was commenting on the matter with familiarity as if complaining about a colleague’s inactivity.
And Lyn, a fifty-something uniformed janitor from my apartment block, has changed the normal course of our conversations about Brad and Angelina or my grocery shopping.
He told me, after my visit to the bank, that "I now have all my savings in money market funds.
The switch is done, I’m not taking any risks.”
Muslim graves desecrated as Austria approaches right
Heinz-Christian Strache of the left wing of Austria's far-right Freedom Party and Belgian Filip Dewinter, affiliated with the far-right Vlaams Belang party, take part in a demonstration to present the organization "Cities against Islamization" in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry traffic signs depicting the mosques with a red line running through them.
Police are blaming far-right extremists for desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same weekend that far-right political parties made huge gains in the country’s general election.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged at the Traun cemetery near Linz sometime between Friday night and this morning, in what police believe was an organized action.
The criminals sprayed Jewish symbols, such as the Star of David, over some of the graves, but researchers think this may have occurred because of an attempt to conceal the real motives of hate-driven extremists against Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether the incident was in any way election-related.
A spokesman for the local Islamic Community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the desecration, which reached Muslim clerics as the month of Ramadan was drawing to a close.
Meanwhile, Austria is gearing up for a round of introspection after the turn to the right in yesterday’s parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that captured nearly 30 percent of the vote, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, had led a campaign focused on anti-immigration vehemence and some of their slogans were considered xenophobic by critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the Freedom Party leader who won more than 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against headscarves and burqas, and also voiced opposition to foods considered related to Islam.
At his last meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a “European brotherhood” to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both parties intend to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they were symbols of the ongoing policy of Islamization in Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which have confirmed the far right as the strongest political bloc in the country, indicate that the change came mainly from young voters who are worried about their future in the European Union.
Travel ban for Gary Glitter
Courts have banned Gary Glitter, the fascinating rock star guilty of sexually abusing children, from traveling to France and Spain.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed surveillance authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain via France.
Kent police issued a travel ban on Thursday after magistrates produced evidence of Glitter’s previous convictions for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at Ashford Magistrates Court in Kent, but was represented by attorney Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the Court Service said: “On Thursday 25 September at Ashford Magistrates’ Court in Kent, police requested a provision to prevent Mr Paul Gadd from travelling abroad as well as to France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd did not attend in person."
Glitter, 64, had informed authorities that he wished to travel abroad, by virtue of being under the sex offender registry.
He has to inform the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days
and it is also necessary to inform the police of the expected date seven days in advance of your departure.
Kent police said they would not discuss Glitter’s individual case or possible whereabouts in the county.
A Kent Police spokesman said: “Kent police will do everything possible to protect children in this country, or abroad.
A Kent Police spokesman said: “Kent police will do everything possible to protect children in this country, or abroad.
“From our point of view, it is easier to monitor someone who remains in the UK because here we have the systems to manage all possible risks more effectively.
“Protecting the people of Kent is the primary concern of Kent Police and we work closely to monitor the behaviour of registered sex offenders in the county and minimise any risk that may exist to the public.”
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese jail for the abuse of two girls, aged between 10 and 11.
When he was released Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he took a flight to London.
However, he said he felt bad and refused to fly to London.
Thai authorities did not allow him to pass through passport control and he eventually flew to Hong Kong.
Chinese authorities also denied him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted he return to Britain.
He probably arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on 22 August and remained there while his lawyer David Corker went to Uxbridge Magistrates Court, west London, after Scotland Yard had successfully applied for the order to register as a sex offender.
Glitter had been jailed in the UK for four months in 1999 for possessing images of child abuse.
A source at the Ministry of Home Affairs reported that Jacqui Smith, the Minister of the Interior, was reassured and pleased to learn that Glitter had been banned from travelling to France and Spain.
"I catch the teacher offstage to extract his character" G<0xC3><0xBC>nther Bauer_Photographer
No heels or ruffles or premiere costumes.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, stripped of the concentration on interpretation to obtain the relaxed appearance of man or woman.
On the other hand, the artist.
The other, the person.
Inseparable except in intimacy, in those moments outside the public, when they find the privacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of a few hands, carefree because they will not go out on the scene.
The German G<0xC3><0xBC>nther Bauer alternates in "Flamenco-people" the theatricality of some mise-en-sc<0xC3><0xA8>ne with singers, dancers and guitarists with that less known side of these masters.
With this proposal, the photographer collects the particular iconography of flamenco from different areas.
Included in the program of the Month of Flamenco Photography, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, greater every day", explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco-people" "can be anyone but, seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists on stage.
These people portrayed "in the street" are artists capable of transmitting on stage passion, sadness, joy... captivating the public.
To capture the personality of these artists you do not have to take pictures of the stage.
They carry their personality and character inside.
What interested me was to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture with the camera the personality of the greats of flamenco."
With the flavor of the festival "Cante de las Minas", Bauer began in 1997 a long journey to portray the singers, guitarists or dancers with a plate camera.
They are portraits that, due to the selection of the camera and the material, recall classical photography.
The application of different stylistic means breaks with the classical basis of the image, giving it modernity, an idea that reflects how Bauer himself understands flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots, which evolves and surprises every day".
It is not the action of the dance, the singing or the touch itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, that captivates the public with his art.
The search for an encounter with the essential, with the duende that becomes visible in a way of feeling, of being and of being are and have been the constant of this work that is presented these days in the gallery El Fot<0xC3><0xB3>mata.
Known flamenco figures such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, make up this selection of almost seventy photographed artists.
The project has become an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits exhibited in the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with "SportARTproject".
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco-people", the photographer admits that "I love to portray people, meet them and be able to enter a moment in their life, be it a long or short moment.
I think that within photography the portrait is the most difficult genre.
You meet or face people, characters, who sometimes you don’t even know, or who give you only a few minutes to take the picture.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true.”
This collection of portraits of current flamenco entitled "Flamenco-people" is exhibited in the El Fot<0xC3><0xB3>mata Gallery, located at number 20 of Calle de la Mata, parallel to the Alameda de Hércules, where it can be visited until October 16.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is "a temerity"
It is set in places he does not yet know and deals with unknown issues, but still, Mario Vargas Llosa is determined to carry out the new project in which he works, a novel that has as its protagonist Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in the Congo and went through the Amazon.
The always favorite to the Nobel Prize for Literature confessed yesterday in his passage through the Hay Festival Segovia that the project that today occupies him "is a temerity" and that "everything indicates that he should not write" the novel.
“If it were wise, I wouldn’t do it, but I’m going to do it and I hope to finish it sometime,” he concluded in his speech at the festival of exchange of ideas, thought and words that for four days has seen a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people pass through the city of the Aqueduct.
The author of "The city and the dogs" was one of the leading figures of the third edition of the feast of the word and fulfilled the forecasts.
Vargas Llosa, who has won the Hay Festival award for being the most voted writer by the participants – an old edition of Dickens’ “Our Mutual Friend” – filled the capacity of the Juan Bravo theater.
Presented by Félix Romeo, he found before him a dedicated audience to whom it was made very short the hour in which the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with great doses of humor, reviewed how his literary vocation was born in him, derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of the "pleasure to read" and "live much more than he lived"; how he writes in a "disciplined manner" of supplying himself with his works.
The Spanish-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if books change lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is a pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience," stressed Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has effects" and "makes people more inconsistent," so he asked the writers "not to abandon themselves to frivolity" and "to assume responsibility.
The climatology diminishes the fair of Pozoblanco that also runs out of rejones
The festival of rejones that closed the subscription of the Pozoblanco fair was suspended yesterday morning, after checking the rejoneadores announced that the floor of the square was not in the best conditions.
In this way, the company, according to Ferm<0xC3><0xAD>n Boh<0xC3><0xB3>rquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the race.
The inclement weather has been primed with this fair, since finally two of its three celebrations have not been able to celebrate.
On Saturday it was the rain that prevented the celebration of the second bullfight planned.
The poster was composed by José Luis Moreno, Curro D<0xC3><0xAD>az and Juan Bautista, who were going to face a bull run by Castilblanco
Only on Friday there was a celebration.
In it, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut three ears and came out on his shoulders, after leaving passages with taste and aesthetics.
That same afternoon Alejandro Talavante paid his two horns with greetings and an ear, which granted more the stretches than his bullfighting.
Of course, even worse was El Juli, which passed through Los Llanos without pity or glory.
In his second bull, after a job of relief won the annoyance of a large part of the public.
A control is skipped in <0xC3><0x81>lava in a van with two thousand kilos of hashish
Five minus ten in the morning.
Traffic control of the Ertzaintza in the municipality of Armi<0xC3><0xB1><0xC3><0xB3>n (<0xC3><0x81>lava).
The agents stop the two occupants of a van and they flee.
Their cargo, more than two tons of hashish, was not enough to stop.
The officers pursued and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old male identified as A.A.J., the Interior Department of the Basque government said in a statement.
The arrested individual has been charged with drug trafficking and forgery of a public document.
The incident was recorded when several officials of the <0xC3><0x81>lava Traffic Unit carried out a transport control on the N-1, as it passed through the municipality of Armi<0xC3><0xB1><0xC3><0xB3>n.
They were about to stop a van for inspection when the driver disobeyed orders, sped up sharply and skipped control.
Officers began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped a couple of miles later on the curb, at which point its two occupants alighted to flee the race through a wooded area.
The ertzainas finally reached one of them and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were carrying and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The back of the vehicle was loaded with hashish bales, so they proceeded to transfer it to police units for a thorough inspection and weighing of the drug.
In addition, the officials verified that the registration had been "doubled" since it did not coincide with the collection in the documentation of the van, so that the arrested person has also been charged with a crime of forging a public document.
The Ertzaintza continues with the investigation to proceed to the arrest of the other suspect, who managed to escape to the race as has been said, and determine the provenance of the seized drug.
The detainee, A. A. J., 28, was transferred to police units to carry out the corresponding proceedings and will be brought to court in the coming hours.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the influence of a drug
Actress Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda of the Melrose Place series, has been arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the influence of some medicine.
A witness saw her perform strange maneuvers as she tried to leave her parking lot in Montecito, a California Highway Patrol spokesman told People magazine.
The witness has detailed that about 16.30 hours, Locklear "was treading on the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the parking lot back and forth, and when going back several times passed over his sunglasses."
Shortly after, the witness, who apparently at first had not recognized the actress, saw that Locklear stopped on a nearby highway and got out of the vehicle.
This person was the one who alerted the emergency services because "she was worried about Locklear's life."
When police arrived they found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which was partially blocking the road.
“She seemed disoriented,” so officers took her to the specialized drug and alcohol center for a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and the excess alcohol was ruled out from the outset, although "as officers observed at first glance, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of some medication."
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of some unspecified substance and entered the local prison at about 7 p.m., although she was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left an Arizona treatment clinic where he was recovering from an episode of anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian federation of IU to assume its powers in the Silva case
The general coordinator of IU and deputy of Izquierda Unida, Gaspar Llamazares, assured today that it will be the regional federation of the formation that will have to make a decision on the case of the former councilor of Youth and Sports of the City of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after he was accused of making favorable deals to relatives.
"I am very federalist for these things, and it will be the Andalusian organization that has to assume its competences," said Llamazares on the action that the party must adopt with the one that until now councilor in the Sevillian consistory.
However, the IU leader defended that the need for "transparency" is present in the possible investigations into the irregularities that Silva may have committed: "IU has always defended that this type of issues have the maximum degree of transparency."
In the same vein, he stressed that the training has "strict ethical codes for all public positions".
'Blood of May', Garci's epic bet
Inspired by the National Episodes of Benito Pérez Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s, José Luis Garci recreates the famous uprising of the Spanish against the French in Sangre de Mayo, which is the most ambitious film in his filmography with about 15 million euros of budget.
In this way, the filmmaker has tried to "illustrate the torrent of characters and social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the well-known novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a at the head of a wide cast of interpreters.
Sangre de Mayo, with more than two and a half hours of footage, premieres this Friday in cinemas, to become in the future a miniseries for Telemadrid of more than four hours.
A great admirer of Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s’s literature, José Luis Garci claims to have fulfilled with this shooting “a childhood dream”, which he should thank to Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Community of Madrid commissioned him three years ago to shoot a commemorative film for the second centenary of May 2 in Madrid, something he accepted as long as the story was based on the National Episodes.
The 15 million budget that the Community of Madrid has contributed in its entirety constitute for Garci a "unique opportunity" to set with the decorations and the appropriate costumes the portrait of "a stunned Spain that was wrong as a boss to fight for, since the struggle for independence led the people to enormous delay with the reign of Ferdinand VII", he said.
But the filmmaker regrets not having had funding like Alatriste or Los fantasmas de Goya - more than double that of Sangre de Mayo -, so he has not been able to shoot some scenes captured in a script signed with Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he has collaborated for almost his entire career.
Therefore, the director of Volver a empezar, has influenced what is his usual way of working, the staging with the actors, with whom he usually rehearses before starting the shooting and to those who do not cast, for seeming "humiliating" and considering that "part of the director's job lies in going to the theater and cinema to know what happens in the industry in which he works".
Many of the performers with whom he agrees in Sangre de Mayo repeat before his camera, as is the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larra<0xC3><0xB1>aga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
A four-time Oscar nominee - of which he won one - Garci believes that any of the three candidates to represent Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, the Sangre de Mayo itself, Seven French Pool Tables and the finally selected, The Blind Sunflowers, do not represent a young generation of Spanish cinema, "which is the one that must be made known," he said.
With this film Garci does not expect awards.
“In the beginning you think you work for posterity, then you realize that you only work for prosperity, and now you settle for making one more film,” explains Garci after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabel Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n recovers the essence of the Sevillian dancer T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Valencia
A Sevillian dancer will pay tribute to a Sevillian dancer.
Carmen T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Valencia, of Catalan father (Floren<0xC3><0xA7> T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana neighborhood and when she was three years old she moved to London with her family.
She was a free dance dancer and specialist in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, pioneering the liberation of women, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and a vegetarian and advocated the abolition of the corset which prevented free movement of women.
The life of this woman, who marked a dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe between the wars, fascinated Isabel Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n.
“I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this character to me and I found it incredible.”
According to the dancer, "we do not intend to tell her life but to collect her spirit.
The titles of his dances have suggested to me flamenco sticks.
So, "the butterfly dance" suggested a guajira, or "the snake dance" a few tangos.
Their dance was sensual and I have been told that my dance is also within this aesthetic,” he says.
The montage has two exceptional collaborations: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing again to Isabel in one in his shows, as he did in the one of "La puerta abierta"; and with the teacher Matilde Coral, who has exceptionally wanted to collaborate with whoever her student was.
"Matilde makes Tortola as a grown-up, the character of maturity.
I’m happy that he has agreed to perform in my work and I feel very honored by it.”
The montage also features the musical composition and guitars of Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Torres and Paco Arriaga, the singing of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga and Moi de Mor<0xC3><0xB3>n; the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who plays the role of the eternal companion of this type of artists who were always in love, and who walk around".
The work also tells in some way the life of this woman who developed in such distant places, especially for the time, as India, United States, or Russia, as well as all over Europe, since he usually resided in London.
"I wanted to remember her because I think she is one of those women who have an enormous influence in a certain time and now nobody knows and much less values her work," says Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n.
The show will begin today at 8.30 pm at the Lope de Vega theater.
The publication of the "Diary of a newly married poet" also closes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diary of a Newlywed Poet" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), the place where Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities programmed by the Ministry of Culture of the Junta de Andaluc<0xC3><0xAD>a to celebrate the "Quentinth Anniversary of Zenobia and Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n" (2006-2008), organized with the object of
In this way, the "Zenobia and Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Trienio" comes to an end with the reissue of this work, with the International Congress that has been held in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel House Museum and with the traveling exhibition "Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez: Aquel popo de luz", which was inaugurated last May and which, after traveling through the different Andalusian provinces of New York, is planned to travel.
Likewise, the Ministry of Culture of the Junta de Andaluc<0xC3><0xAD>a has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diary of a Newlywed Poet", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and work of one of the most universal Andalusian poets.
America likes it less without Paul Newman
“Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them."
The phrase is by actress Sally Field, who worked with him on "Absence of Malice," and gives the idea of the helplessness of American cinema, and all of America, before the shocking idea that Newman is gone.
It cost them an Oscar.
He has been retired since 2007.
And that he was known to be very ill.
Still, it was a blow to everyone.
“Sometimes what one feels is beyond all expression, and I have now lost a great friend,” cried Robert Redford, “my life and my country were better because of their existence.”
No one was afraid of making a fool of themselves or exaggerating.
A father of cinema and country had died at a particularly dark time, afraid of terrorists and markets, with American self-esteem on the ground, desperately searching for reasons for dignity.
When time is so hard and without virtue men and very few beings to admire you remain, you do not have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
He embodied for everyone an almost platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was a formal enemy of Richard Nixon and champion of lost and won causes, from the drug-fighting foundation created in honor of his first-born son who died of an overdose to his brand of home-cooked, organic food.
A gift to a country that has had a hard time overcoming a suicidal food culture.
The shock wave of admiration swept through Hollywood without taking into account nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, stated that not one man has died, but an era.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes, said working with Newman was nothing less than the pinnacle of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
"He has set the bar very high for all of us," said George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today dares to try to live as Paul Newman lived: keeping high the demand for probity and have a serious private life and away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today’s media jungle.
But there are those who try, and Paul Newman is their example.
He was once divorced but then married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was faithful when he surely had plenty of opportunities not to be.
“But why am I going to eat hamburger outside the house, if I have steak inside?” he used to joke.
In heaven he is proud that on earth his daughters match his fans, something not so common in America.
“Of all the great roles he played, none was as proud as that of devoted husband, loving father, caring grandfather, and dedicated philanthropist,” they say.
The imperfect career of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is to hold an Olympics in Madrid and, after the failed 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday’s race, I say no!
The perfect race they called it, and in my opinion it’s been the worst race by far I’ve ever been in.
A heap of nonsense that, of course, if they took it into account as an evaluation and I examined it, would be a very clear suspension.
But let’s go by parts and from the beginning.
The nonsense begins with the collection of the dorsal, which makes you have to go before.
Which does not seem bad to me, but if they already make you go give it everything (including the chip to avoid queues in the race).
Well, no.
Here they only made you go to pick up the dorsal (first nonsense, go just for that) and (after the relevant tail), surprise!, there was only size 'S' for the shirt (second nonsense, because I need a size XL)
What world do we live in?
Or is it that because of the crisis they have decided to buy only small T-shirts with less fabrics and cheaper?
Well, things like this are a minor detail compared to race day.
Apart from having to go very early to pick up the chip, the queue on arrival is 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave the backpack.
More than 35 minutes lasted the wait, something incomprehensible for a race where more than 11,000 people are expected.
Then, unsurprisingly, the race began and we had not yet left the backpack, although once achieved, the collection was worse.
In addition, the rain softened the wait of more than 40 minutes, which was joined with allegations of popular rebellion and assault on the booth.
I believe that about 500 people will surely have pneumonia tomorrow, and some like me, will not even appear with the correct time in the classification, due to the chip they gave me that, I imagine, did not mark the exit correctly.
Of course, if I were asked about the perfect race, it would not enter my thoughts.
So I think we will continue to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At MIT’s Emerging Technologies conference, Microsoft showed a breakthrough of a new image recognition and human interaction system, a kind of Artificial Intelligence without much intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to move around the company’s campus) according to what you hear in the conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a face and shape recognition system, this “receptionist” can know how many people are in the room, who they are – even remember what they are wearing – and listen to and understand the keywords of their conversations.
Also group those present according to the conversation groups.
In the sample video the receptionist detects a third person but understands that he does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that he is not an employee of the company.
He asks her if she is there to visit someone and tells her he will see her soon.
All without a blue screen.
Impressive.
But that, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example on the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week there has been much talk of a change in strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and won’t have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer has discovered that if computers came with the essentials instead of loaded with commercial garbage, they would go five times faster - man, Steve, it'll be for less.
All a finding considering that Microsoft, version after version, has added features and "extras" to Windows.
The change of course is appreciated.
Microsfot is right, the operating system is losing importance, and so is the software.
When Google Chrome came out on the net, I was one of those who joined the theory that it was Google’s first step to competing with Windows.
Many have rightly pointed out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is the essential layer for the Hardware and Software to be understood.
It fulfills the same function as your wife or your husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law.
It's true.
It will never disappear but you have to think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but relative.
What Ballmer has said this week is confirmation of this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system, and more and more to the web browser.
The computer boots up just to run Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and every day we spend more time browsing than in the windowed environment.
What is the purpose of half of the applications that come into the system?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 has to be less, much less, than Vista.
Less heavy, less loaded, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services and that they are finally an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, in fact, and I bring a small example.
The photo of this post was taken in one of Microsoft’s employee break rooms in Redmond earlier this month.
In the soft drink machine a poster asks them to use their search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the web.
Last week, by the way, a delay in the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was also confirmed.
It will not come at the beginning of 2009 but at the end, rather pulling to 2010.
At Microsoft they will surely look for the joint launch of Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, is becoming more and more computerized every day.
But the delay, with Android and the iPhone already on the street, will take its toll.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio wore one in Edward Zwick's 'Diamond of Blood', as did Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' and is part of the muscular gay parish uniform.
And if we begin to enumerate stellar apparitions, we can go back to the image of that strong pointed mustache that lifted weights in a traveling circus.
In essence, it is nothing more than the typical men's indoor t-shirt in cotton, tight and sleeveless.
The 'tank', which the speaking Angles call, but le Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles stands out above all the others.
First, by its booming name - although it is familiarly known as 'Marcel' - it has to do with the sport because it gets its name, according to legend, from the boxer Marcel Cerdan, lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
'La Marcel' stands out above the others for its excellent cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive shield and for the small Belgian flag (only recognizable) that the most emblematic models of t-shirt have as a detail on the neck.
And be careful, because the production of the Belgian firm is not only focused on its tank tops.
It also includes college sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, sailor t-shirts, babies, mini shorts...
Clothing designed for underwear comfort.
It’s a shame to leave them as underwear.
They have too much charm.
"I want to be a young mom; the candidate doesn't worry me"
His enormous resemblance to his sister has not prevented him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
The Cruz sisters are now taking their new fashion business very seriously.
For Monica, they are much more than beautiful and famous girls who lend their name.
He has been in Paris in the promotion that the firm Mango does in its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important fashion awards that the Spanish house sponsors.
Warm and shy, she wins at short distances.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I have designed for Mango in this new autumn-winter season, in addition to attending the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the Opera dinner in honor of Valentino.
Come on, a very intense but, at the same time, exciting day.
On what is your new collection for Mango based in this fourth season working for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I love the cinema of the 50s and 60s; from there we get many references.
Then, I really like to get lost in a city and observe the women as they are dressed, how they combine and mix their clothes, I do a lot.
Dancer, actress and designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so but, in the end, everything comes together and they have a lot of ties in common.
Since I was a child I liked clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother’s house to rummage through my aunt’s closets and see her clothes.
It was the bomb, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, as a dancer, I always tried to take care of how I dressed.
You know that dancers really like to do our styles for classes and rehearsals, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of an actress when you get the costumes is when you really find the character.
So, everything goes together, yes, with a lot of respect for the designers and professionalism.
You have not been in your 30s, have you had a crisis?
What's going on?
I feel better than ever, I like 30.
I find that the woman is made, has experience and savors life with fewer mistakes.
The biological clock doesn’t scare me.
I have done the things I wanted since I was little and this has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, are you thinking about being a mother or not?
Of course, I know that I am going to be a mother because the body asks me to be, and I also want to be a young mother; I do not want to miss this.
As for the candidate, I’m not worried.
What I will do is give my son a lot of happiness and educate him with a lot of love.
As for the cinema, you are looking forward to several premieres that you shot last year.
That's right, and I'm looking forward to seeing the light.
I, who am a woman who comes from the theater, I am very impatient and restless, I want everything for now and of course, it can not be.
I'm looking forward to 'The Last Hour' and 'In Search of the Tomb of Christ.'
See what they look like...
A few days ago you debuted on a catwalk with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Well, well, don't say that.
It's not like I was on a catwalk modeling.
I was simply called by Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for a long time, to invite me to London to participate in a charity parade for her organization 'Women for a Better World' and the clothes we exhibited - I took out two pieces from our collection for Mango - were auctioned off to raise money for this NGO of Naomi.
People don't know about Naomi's tender heart.
So many things are said about her that, I who know her, would tell you that many are not true.
Besides, I'm sticking with that good part she gets involved in.
He asked me to parade for such a noble cause, but if he asks me to do the pine, so be it.
To benefit women in the third world, whatever it takes.
Recidivist drivers for alcoholemia must install the 'alcolock'
Interior wants the driver with three administrative penalties for alcohol, have to install in his vehicle a system that prevents starting the drunk vehicle, or if it is not blown.
The initiative was already announced last June and is now included in the annual report of the Attorney General’s Office, according to which it is a pilot project that will last one year.
Its purpose is the reinsertion of the driver, so he will also receive a road reeducation course.
In addition to the Attorney General for Road Safety, the General Directorate of Traffic (DGT) and the Technological Institute for Automobile Safety (FITSA) Foundation will participate in the experience.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists reported more than once for drunk driving return to take the car.
The alcolock would avoid it since it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the rate of alcohol in expired air and prevents starting the car if the driver does not blow abtes; or when a concentration of alcohol is detected it is higher than that allowed.
Its cost is over 1,000 euros and would be borne by the sanctioned.
In this sense, a study carried out in the US in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with these devices reduce infringements by up to 65% during the first year of implementation.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people every year.
The measure confines itself to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to address such behaviour before it leads to criminal offences.
And facilitate its implementation, since the legal reform can be done by the ordinary way, and yet the necessary reform by the criminal way requires a reform in an organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial modality, although it has already been implemented experimentally in some industrial and public service vehicles.
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote tomorrow on an initiative of the PSOE in which it intends to install this system on school buses, as has been carried out in France.
In Mexico and without peep-toes
With British punctuality, at 17.40, the scheduled time in the program, landed in the presidential Hangar of the Benito Juarez airport in Mexico City the plane of the Spanish air force in which the Princes of Asturias were traveling.
The sun was retreating but its rays still forced to use the hand as a visor to see the royal couple get off the plane.
At the foot of the steps, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities.
Hours earlier he had asked the taxi driver if he knew that the Spanish princes were visiting the city to formalize an official trip.
- Ah, very good, then you can not go to the airport to load at that time... She is from here or so...
- No, no sir, she's Spanish but she lived here a couple of years.
- Ah, very good...
But the Mexican press knows very well who the Princes of Asturias are and the importance of the trip.
Many are waiting in the hangar of the airport glued to the red carpet and a military fence formed by 27 marines who play the salvo of honors.
The Prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the Princess, mane to the wind, very sober, does not use his usual peep-toes, perhaps they had communicated to him that in the DF threatened storm.
They give a smile and a brief stop to the photographers before moving on to the room where the official entourage awaits.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the big four in the city, a gossip reporter from Mexican television awaits them.
The Best Gifted Fashion Award
There may be no place in the world more appropriate to present a fashion award, than Paris and there may be no living designer more exquisite and bont vive than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of El Bot<0xC3><0xB3>n-Mango Fashion Awards, to promote the international projection of new fashion talents.
It is endowed with a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her designs in the Mango window at number 54 of the boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost cried of emotion.
By the way, it is the second largest store of the firm in Europe and has just opened with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first is in London.
So many events, combined with the desire to thank the designer Valentino who presided over the jury of the contest, made us end up at a luxury dinner at the opera Garnier in Paris.
With the proximity of the most exquisite Chagals, the presidential gala table prepared by Mango, looked even more spectacular.
Nati, heartbroken and heartbroken by the recent death of his brother, donned a suit from the House and some ELAH dressings, which cut his breath, and from the arm of his son Luis - a cannon of almost two meters in length - accompanied Valentino in the presidency of his tribute dinner.
Andik, owner and lord of Mango, did the honors and is so gentleman that he ended up, next to the Baron of Rotchil, without a jacket, because both had lent them to two ladies.
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica Cruz, who came to the store with pants and shirt - of her own design - and for dinner was transformed into a sexy long black dress, was excited when on the night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, we were shown the ballet rehearsal room and she, remembering other times, grabbed one of the bars and made a cache of 'grand plie'.
Inés Sastre did not stay at the walk through the palace, but before she showed us on the mobile phone photos of her son.
The next morning we were able to enjoy the view with the presence of Olivier Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez - another cannon that travels by motorcycle - and by John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and having previously asked that there be no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh there, that's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are not 1000 but 1000 more ways to forget the chaotic and frenetic everyday life.
And as if that were not enough, they are all gathered in a book that will bring relaxation to bookstores on September 30.
The alarm clock almost punishes when it rings every morning at 7 a.m., but it is even worse to imagine oneself wrapped in the hectic rhythm that today’s life imposes.
The office is called tension and the computer back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are not one or two methods to combat daily burnout and problems of disconnection from the world of work.
No, the number amounts to, nothing more and nothing less, than 1001.
Regardless of the yoga positions, the classic massage or the 'spa' treatments, Susannah Marriott gathers in the pages of a book a whole 'menu' of possibilities adapted to the taste and minutes of each one.
The anti-stress work is called '1001 ways to relax' and its calm will reach the bookstores by the hand of the publishing house Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone considers that it is not possible to achieve tranquility in areas such as work or through personal relationships, this 'manual' refutes such a belief.
In addition, it offers other procedures such as being in contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline no longer runs through your veins to restore body balance and stress has become an issue, it’s time to sit on the couch, disconnect your mind and focus on reading.
Sleep talk
Some children talk at night.
I don’t mean those who wake up very smart telling us something that happened the day before, but children who talk while sleeping.
The first time it happens you might get a scare, but it doesn’t really matter.
It is a benign sleep disorder called somniloquies.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure more than one of you has been told that you spoke at night.
This phenomenon can appear very sporadically (once in life for example associated with an episode of high fever), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month...), the next day the child does not remember anything.
There is no single cause that determines its occurrence.
They are often related to other sleep disturbances such as nightmares, night terrors, bedwetting (sleep peeing) or sleepwalking, but it does not have to be that way.
As we have already mentioned, they can also be associated with very high fever, stress or overexcitement.
However, it is an understudied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also very variable.
It may be that he speaks in a calm tone of voice, loose words, a murmur or quite the opposite (screams, cries, long speeches ...).
In cases where the manifestation is very intense it would be advisable to observe the child and consult with a specialist, to check if there is any question that is generating a lot of anxiety and gives way in this way.
We have said that it is a benign alteration, therefore it has no treatment, unless it is associated with another sleep alteration that can be treated (for example, if it is associated with sleep apnea or a stress situation).
What can be done is to take into account a series of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child too much before going to sleep.
Therefore look for quiet games and avoid shows or TV series that are scary or a little violent.
With children who are very nervous and find it hard to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them gain some inner calm.
This will allow the child to have a quieter sleep.
Once sleepiness appears, try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will not remember anything about what has happened.
Useful tips
Don't wake him up.
It is useless, because he is not conscious, and you will break his sleep.
Even if he is talking, he is sleeping and therefore resting.
Remember that if you are very anxious during several episodes it would be advisable to consult or find out what generates so much anxiety in the child.
If what he says is understood (which is not the most usual thing), do not fall into the temptation to make an interrogation to extract information from him.
You will get nothing, because when you are asleep you are not conscious enough to organize your thinking.
Also you will hear what he says, but you do not know what he is dreaming to say that, so be very careful in how you interpret the information and with the conclusions you draw.
Never tell the child that you can interrogate him at night to find out his secrets.
Not even a joke.
That generates a lot of anxiety.
In short, don’t worry, it’s nothing bad, it’s an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illhaeusern at last!
The football club, Illhaeusern, finally found its way to victory on their field after a long period of shortages.
Without having made a good match, the team created many chances of goal and was able to make a goal to win the match.
The pace was not very constant during this encounter in which the aggressors had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by Captain Kauffmann brushing the squad with a shot from a distance, Illhaeusern almost went to take the "power" and in turn Fonderflick from afar, then with Hirn up, Romain with the tip of his foot or also Diebold came to prevent the defense of Dannemarie.
In front, we did not let the midfielder pass and we left only Riahi in the attacking position.
The start of the second half was crucial, first with two chances of goal from Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the scoreboard for the Illhousiens with the goal from Marais, well placed to pick up the rejected ball in a first attempt from Diebold (53').
But the scorer Illhousiens will not be able to taste his happiness for long and will be forced to return to the wardrobe a dozen minutes later and thus leave his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not take advantage of the opportunity and it will not be a problem for the eleven illhousiens who backed up a little to "compress" their defense, except in the last seconds of the game during which, after a major blitz, the ball passed very close to the cross field.
Sarkozy finds the fishermen furious
Before taking off for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a detour around Brittany.
Faced with the demonstration of resistance on the part of the fishermen who strongly disturbed the entrances of several Breton and Norman ports last Monday, the President of the Republic decided to go last Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in the Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re, to find his representatives there.
They promised to welcome him “in a constructive spirit” and hope that “he will come up with concrete proposals”.
This presidential visit coincides with the general meeting of the " crisis committee " created by the Breton fishermen to achieve measures against the increase in diesel prices, which marks a record by reaching 1.14 euros per liter.
According to Elysee spokesman David Martinon, the president "will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their companies become competitive again and to save the conditions of employment and remuneration of sailors".
The fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy on firm footing.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out operations to reduce traffic in the Morbihan and Calvados, which have caused traffic jams of almost 10 km.
The marina of Quiberon has also been blocked, but connections to Belle-<0xC3><0xAE>le have not been stopped.
A "filter barrier" has been set up on the Quiberon peninsula.
The sailors showed their determination on Monday by burning, at dawn, tires and wooden pallets in front of the fuel tanks of the ports of Brest, and Lorient, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the English Channel, such as at Les Sables d'Olonne, in the Vendée, where the bulls stayed in port, or at Le Havre, where some twenty ships blocked the movements of merchant ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Croisic, in the Loire-Atlantique region, stopped in the afternoon the blockade of the important Total de Donges refinery.
The fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until Wednesday's meeting that will take place at the ministry to think about possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the " crisis committee " will have to think on Tuesday about the development of the movement and its participation in the meeting planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officials of the national fisheries committee, which did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue " because " the fishermen did not abandon " and " do not want to move to Paris ", announced for example Liliane Cariou, the president of the committee of the fisheries of Lorient.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, currently pay about 50 cents per litre but believe that the financial break-even point of a boat can be reached with only one diesel with a price below €0.30 per litre.
The Great Paul Newman
The unforgettable performer of “Two Men and a Fate” has died of cancer, aged 83, at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and also Sam Mendes greeted the film legend and the committed actor, Paul Newman, who has died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecast for 2008
The Brazilian aeronautics company has 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the threats of recession that weigh on the world economy.
The world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer, Embraer, maintains its 2008 delivery forecast with 215 aircraft delivered, Embraer president Fredrico Fleury Curado said.
During the first half, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer relies heavily on the Chinese market particularly to sell aircraft ranging from 30 to 120 seats.
Today, Embraer has delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG plans to sell more than 15% of its assets
The insurer American International Group, which has been bailed out thanks to U.S. monetary authorities, is seeking to sell more than 15 percent of its assets with the aim of repaying its $85 billion loan, according to Sunday’s edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is willing to consider selling most of its services beyond its international life insurance and retirement insurance in the United States.
AIG’s board of directors met last Sunday afternoon to examine potential sales, according to the Financial Times.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
Assets from which AIG intends to divest include its air leasing subsidiary, International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in insurer Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and its investments in private equity, the Financial Times adds.
No definitive decision has been made on these sales, the Financial Times said.
AIG must quickly build up liquidity to repay its $85 billion loan granted to it by the Federal Reserve at the risk of seeing U.S. authorities take 80% of its capital, diluting it with the proper proportion among current shareholders.
Analysis of the historic session of the Paris Stock Exchange
The New York Stock Exchange suffered a historic fall last Monday after the House of Representatives rejected the Paulson plan to save the banks: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a loss never seen on the Stock Exchange of almost 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 777.68 to 10,365.45.
In terms of points, the most significant drop in its history (684.81 points) had been recorded in the past on September 17, 2001, the day on which the exchanges began again after the terrorist attacks of September 11.
The technology-dominant Nasdaq index fell 199.61 points to 1,983.73 and the Standard & Poor's 500 widened by 8.81% (106.85 points) to 1,106.55, according to final closing figures.
Already depressed by the crisis at the beginning of the session, Wall Street sank after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the plan to save the banks that would have allowed to regain some stability in the markets.
With 228 votes against and 205 in favor, the representatives denied US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the means he requested.
About two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
"That's not a good signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"This shows the extent to which the market relied on this plan," added Lindsey Piegza, fearing that a project adopted within several days would arrive "too late".
“If the project is truly moribund ... the Fed and other central banks will quickly take over to manage the crisis, which would further tighten credit conditions,” warned Brian Bethune, head of economics and finance at Global Insight.
And further underlining the sense of urgency, " every day that passes heralds the downfall of a financial institution " in the United States, Ms. Piegza stressed.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual last Friday, the authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia’s banking activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis accelerated dramatically, prompting emergency interventions for the benefit of banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, which shows that markets are facing “not just a crisis in the US but a global crisis,” the FTN Financial analyst added.
The bond market went up dramatically.
The 10-year Treasury yield fell 3.632 percent from 3.827 percent on Friday afternoon and the 30-year Treasury yield fell 4.161 percent from 4.357 percent the day before.
Obama wins first televised duel
The first debate on Friday between the two candidates in the White House was another to find out who has triumphed between John McCain and Barack Obama.
Unsurprisingly, Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed their own victory in this televised duel that has been followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen said John McCain’s performance, while honorable, was “not bright enough” to allow him to slow his decline in polls five weeks before the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, whose public opinion poll released last Saturday gives Obama a five-point lead (49% vs. 44% for McCain), judges that it is the Democrat who did well.
Among undecided voters, Obama emerged victorious with 39 percent of those polled, while 25 percent of them concede victory to McCain, according to a CBS poll.
Obama could confirm his lead on Thursday with the expected good performance of his fellow candidate, Jose Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sara Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
He has good instincts,” Bill Clinton warned this weekend.
The septuagenarian McCain highlighted his indisputable experience in foreign policy, underlining the "na<0xC3><0xAF>vety" of his adversary on these issues that were at the heart of this first confrontation.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that he... "accused on several occasions.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the experience and the knowledge to be president,” he said.
These words have been repeated since yesterday in Republican television commercials.
Obama said it represented the future.
Undeterred, he was concise and precise.
It enhanced his ability to make the right choices, and to restore America’s image in the world.
"McCain has not yet understood, while Obama has already done so," a Democratic television ad retorted this weekend, blaming the Republican for not having considered the importance of the impact of the crisis on Americans.
“During the 90 minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you,” Obama denounced, in front of 20,000 people who had gathered for an election meeting in North Carolina in heavy rain.
He did not utter the words “middle class” or “workers.” “Financial defeat clearly favors Obama, who is regarded by Americans as the person most capable of saving the economy that is on the edge of the precipice.
“Next week could be a defining episode,” said influential Democrat Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic Rep. Rahm Emanuel, a former Clinton administration official, likened Obama’s “good economic instincts” to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
According to the Democratic candidate, the current financial disaster “is the final consequence of eight years of bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and sustained by Senator McCain.”
Reaffirming that he would nevertheless reduce taxes on 95% of Americans despite the shocks of Wall Street, the Illinois senator also noted that the realization of an eventual energy independence of the country thanks to the promotion of renewable energies was his first priority, with the creation of a safety and health system.
McCain wants to build a park of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Prudent, both candidates dodged questions about the extremely unpopular $700 billion financial rescue plan adopted by Congress yesterday afternoon.
" In Minsk, " Have you noticed the elections in Minsk? "
Young people and opponents demonstrated last Sunday afternoon in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject in advance the results of the legislative elections.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday afternoon since the closure of polling stations in Minsk’s central square to protest the fraudulent nature of the legislative elections.
While no result had yet been announced, numerous young people had come to demonstrate against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko: "the dictator, he has to resign".
Some admit not to have voted: "for what, since they will do what they want with my vote," says a young man.
They do not believe that the regime that put a good face on foreign observers in order to renew contact with the European Union is willing to effect democratic change.
Sanctions, including visa bans for 40 Belarusian leaders and asset freezes, could be lifted if these elections are seen as clean for observers.
Not according to the opposition.
"We have been put on the side of the electoral commissions and our observers were not able to participate in the counting of the votes," lamented Yury Potemkin, the spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous regrouping of twelve parties.
"It's a cosmetic change," said Alexandre Milinkievitch, a former candidate of the opposition to the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, "because the important thing is who counts the votes, and in our house, it is the executive power.
If some opposition MPs enter parliament, it is because they will have been appointed but not elected.
“But their entry into parliament can mean TV appearances, meetings in the regions and bill proposals.”
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because " dialogue with the European Union must begin.
Because if our economy, which has a lot of debt to Russia, goes into crisis, and if we don’t reform, we are in danger of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process will not recognize the validity of the vote.
He stressed that turnout figures seemed too high, and that the generalization of early voting (26% of voters in Minsk) favored manipulations.
" Have you noticed the elections? Ask the Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozoulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition deputies to the parliament, those who are best suited to power.”
The silence of the night returns again in the square of October.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Commission congratulate each other on their success.
The interview - Blood is safe again
Yesterday, Héma-Québec celebrated its 10th anniversary of its founding, and its president, Francine Décary, was right to rejoice, because Héma-Québec has once again become one of the safest and most effective providers of blood in the world.
And above all, it regained the public’s trust that had been seriously shaken by the tainted blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, national blood reserves administered by the Canadian Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service have been contaminated by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In the face of this drama and public discontent, the Government of Canada conducted a public survey in February 1994, chaired by Judge Horacio Krever, which sought to clarify the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations so that such a disaster would no longer be reproduced.
While Judge Krever was slow to present their relationship, certain provinces then created a committee that aimed to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau committee fulfilled this mission.
As a result of the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers have been created in Canada: Héma-Québec to supply Quebec and the Canadian Blood Corporation to supply all other provinces and both territories.
“In 1998, when Héma-Québec began its activities, almost 38% of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec,” recalls Décary.
The situation was discouraging.
Having made many efforts to improve the safety of blood products and a lot of work over the years that followed, we have regained the public’s trust,” he says before proudly stating that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of the Quebec population now had confidence in Héma-Québec.
Dr. Décary recalls, however, that “trust is an extremely fragile thing.”
Since its creation on September 28, 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, we were witnessing in Europe the birth of numerous cases of the human variant of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says Décary.
And we didn't know if this disease could be transmitted through the blood.
Then we rely on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports, according to which when we do not know and when a serious disease can emanate from that, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease that is characterized by a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, we install exclusion measures.
In April 1999, we denied the blood of people who had been in the UK for more than a month since 1980.
But, a few years ago, it has been proven beyond any doubt that this disease is transmitted by the blood.
This episode thus showed us that the precautionary principle that was applied made sense.”
In 1999, a much more sensitive technique for detecting HIV appeared on the market: nuclide acid tests that make it possible to detect the presence of the virus directly in the blood of donors and not that of antibodies against the virus, on which the tests used until now were based.
Nucleic acid tests shortened the period between the time the person has been infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
We were able to reduce this period by less than a week.
This substantially reduces the risk that certain donors will unknowingly become infected and that we will not be able to detect them.
These improvements significantly lowered the risk of getting AIDS from a blood transfusion.
Today, one person in every 12 million is at risk of receiving HIV-contaminated blood.
That means 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
Since Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products every year, it will be more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission by a blood product occurs.
I believe that today you can receive or prescribe a blood transfusion to regain health without worries," says the head of the management of Héma-Québec.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to keep our products safe.
It is never known which pathogen might emerge in the system.
Last year, the Chikungunya virus appeared on Reunion Island, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
We must be constantly vigilant,” Dr. Décary said, before stressing that in addition to a secure supply, Héma-Québec must also provide sufficient supply.
" Needs increase as the population ages.
Since anticancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need an injection of red blood cells or platelets.
The aging of the population also has consequences for the blood donor network, which comprises on average only 3% of Quebecers eligible for blood donation. "
All healthy, 18-year-olds who meet the eligibility criteria can still donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who propose their blood are not accepted, because they suffer from AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they traveled to a country where malaria reigns, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
“With this 3%, we were able to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
The hardships are very rare.
But the members of this donor network must be renewed as they get older and can no longer donate their blood.
But it is difficult to convince people to donate their blood, but above all to retain them and encourage them to be a regular donor.
Since current life is so rampant, we rarely find the time to spend an hour donating her blood,” says Francine Décary.
With a budget of $297 million annually, Héma-Québec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, transformed and frozen before being stored in Hema-Québec, which also manages the only public cord blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was once considered biomedical waste is filled with a rich blood of stem cells that can be used for the treatment of serious diseases such as leukemia.
"We celebrated a few weeks ago, the placing in the bank of our thousandth sample of umbilical cord blood and it is expected to draw more than a thousand of these per year.
We would have to start proposing it for grafts early next year,” says Dr. Décary who describes this cord blood sampling program as very popular.
"Many moms are disappointed not to be able to enjoy this ", since Héma-Québec does not have the resources to propose this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Softball - The Impact in the Semifinals
The Montreal Impact qualified for the semifinals of the USL First Division playoffs, thanks to a 3-1 (4-3 finish) victory at the expense of the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, during the second and decisive match of the quarterfinal series, at the Saputo Stadium.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After the first half without a goal from either side, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino created many chances for goal.
Roger Levesque was the only one to upset Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Recall that during the first game of the round-robin series on Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 loss at Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle.
The Impact will face the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semifinals.
On Saturday afternoon in Minnesota, the Thunder lost 3-1 in the second leg to take it 4-3, but the Whitecaps nonetheless advanced to the semifinals 5-4.
The Impact is expected to face the Whitecaps next Friday and Sunday, but details of the series will be confirmed today.
In brief – Kovalev’s victorious goal
The Canadian’s No. 1 trio is set to embark on the season.
The team of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn encouraged the attack in a 3-2 win by the Canadian to the barrier free throws against the Florida Panthers, last night, at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec accumulated two assists, and Kovalev picked up a pass in this win, the fourth of the Tricolor in six preparatory matches.
Kovalev gave the victory by scoring the only goal.
"I'm not ready yet, I warn the Russian.
"I need another game to feel comfortable."
He tried to play to the maximum in the first half, Guido Carbonneau scored.
But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a nice ovation.”
Charest takes care of the North
The prime minister does not rule out starting elections before the end of the year
As soon as the general council of the Liberal Party was over, Jean Charest went yesterday to Juan-Talon, in Quebec, where the new health minister, Yves Bolduc (left), is trying to get elected during today’s by-election.
To reject the limits of our last great northern frontier ": such is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force staying in the broad lines, at the end of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, images were projected.
On three huge screens, spectacular images of hydroelectric reservoirs, mining exploitation, Quebec seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc. paraded.
Great means as during the electoral period.
The prime minister thinks the election will take place this fall, although he did show that his schedule was very full.
The "Northern Plan" is the fourth side of a "vision" that the Prime Minister intends to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes an agreement on labor with France, an alliance between Canada and Europe and harmonies with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory at the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The prime minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North was "a jewel of immense potential", but did not give a deadline, investment amounts, or precise priority in future projects.
What could above all be more developed are: particularly hydroelectricity, the forest, but above all the mining sector, doped by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructures.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and also diamond," according to Mr. Charest's enumeration.
This "territory twice as large as France" is our home, it's in Quebec.
Not only is it at home, but it is in us,” he insisted, as if to show he was soliciting a national founding myth.
Quebec was built a lot thanks to its relationship with the North, he stressed: the flood to gold in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
“It belongs to us, it’s our future,” he added, after having taken a theatrical break to contemplate the immense map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec territory, comprises a part of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the prime minister said during the press conference.
" It is a traditional position that all governments have reiterated.
There is a border line on which they have not agreed for a long time and, when the occasion presents itself, I reiterate that position on the part of the government,” he said.
In addition, "with climate change, we have to rethink our view of the North," he said of the Northwest Passage, which will open every year because of ice melting.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister considers that occupying the territory is a duty.
What about the people of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The prime minister said the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, particularly young people.
Two former ministers who come from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former deputy of the Quebec party of Ungava), have already started consultations about thirty communities.
An inter-ministerial committee chaired by Beno<0xC3><0xAE>t Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) plays an important role, began some work.
The prime minister does not rule out an important meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a meeting at which "a common vision will be given".
The development of the North would be done in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan “will be concerted, orderly and environmentally friendly,” he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as one that is in continuity with that of the liberal prime ministers who preceded it.
" Like the liberals who came before us, we have thought differently to transform challenges into new opportunities for growth and development. "
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a large cocktail to underline the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage’s arrival to power of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Beauharnois Dam at the Adélard-Godbout Reservoir.
"From Godbout, who created HydroQuebec, to Lesage who made the Revolution quiet and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, to Bourassa who made James Bay our party knew how to forge the future," declared Juan Charest.
At the press conference, he invoked another reference, the conservative one, the program "Roads to the North" by John Diefenbaker, prime minister from 1957 to 1963.
Addressing the issue of the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, Mr. Charest stressed that its commissioning is scheduled for 2012.
"This stays between us, but I expect to be there," he confided to his militants, rousing applause.
Indeed, the prime minister, who said in April that elections would not take place in 2008 and certainly not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of launching a vote this autumn, which the law allows him to do.
He stresses that his schedule is nevertheless full, particularly because of a mission of the federation council in China and a Quebec-New York summit.
The weekend general council provided the Liberal chief with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, particularly " constitutional aspirations " which had no problem being accepted: the Liberal Party of Quebec in particular calls for recognition of the " specificity of Quebec " in the Constitution.
He also wished Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Council and to have a right of veto over decisions taken in Quebec.
On the opposition side, we welcomed the broad lines of the Plan Norte with skepticism.
The head of the Quebec party, Pauline Marois, highlighted the Northern Quebec Development Policy that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, coming to power in 2003, gave up applying it.
Had he done so, "we would have made progress today," said Ms Marois alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (vote today), Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Mercure.
The Quebec Democratic Action appeared to support the adoption of a Plan North by the government.
"But what is desired is that this is not just a show," commented leader Sebastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who returns from vacation today.
Lyrics - A dishonoured country
It is Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of "Justice" (oh irony!) in the Harper cabinet, who allowed himself last summer to say that Louise Arbour was a "shame" on Canada.
To dishonour in this way this woman who waged an unceasing struggle for justice and who deserves all our admiration for what she says all about the Prime Minister and Stephen Harper’s relations.
We are in front of a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, that has not repatriated its national who is locked up in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
It is a government that does not take into account in any way the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager when the events that are recriminating him occurred.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada signed the Geneva Convention, reneges on its promise and lets a child soldier live in inhumane conditions.
He's the only one who's sluggish with a bogus justice system to assess the defendant's guilt.
Let us recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, in particular, support the repatriation of Omar Khadr in order for him to enjoy the benefit of a fair trial in Canada.
It is this government that closes its eyes to torture: it cares little that a young adult is psychologically destroyed, no doubt forever after so many years of exactions.
We do not yet realize that, but we are witnessing at this moment an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our “democracy,” that is the word Harper keeps repeating and it makes no sense.
The time has come when no morality exists anymore: we can arbitrarily abuse, torture, imprison a Canadian citizen as the hitherto minority head of government wants (what will happen after October 14?).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that commends Virtue, Law and Order: they do not see that this government renounced what made the reputation and dignity of our country.
Mr. Toews, the shame is caused by this resignation and nothing else.
The Orwellian Discourse of Barrick Gold
In its Sept. 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, vice president and director of Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Following an Orwellian logic, Barrick Gold claims that the largest gold company in the world attempted a €6 million defamation suit against three authors and a small publishing house in order to provoke a “transparent public debate”.
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of defamation prosecutions, but the law.
Unsurprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely hidden by Mr. Garver.
Why, according to Barrick Gold, would the best way to conduct a public debate be to harm anyone who dares to hold a position contrary to his?
The outcome of the lawsuit is of little importance, the authors and the publisher of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums in order to prepare their defense and to fight, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by the almost bottomless pockets of the mining company.
The tactic, in these unequal struggles, is often to ruin the defendants in order to impose a friendly settlement that will gag the opposition as well as frighten anyone who dares to re-examine the issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it is in front of public opinion that he would have had to present his view of the facts.
Contrary to what is done in several countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada are usually made by the change of ideas and not by clubbing.
It was enough for the mining company to open its books, its files and establish a real debate, through newspapers, the media, publications and the financing of independent search teams that could have clarified the issue.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to trust public opinion and rejects the petitions and letters of support for the authors of Noir Canada.
Perhaps Mr. Garver could explain how he can call for a "public" debate by disregarding the latter's views?
According to the vice president, it seems that this word refers only to high-paid lawyers and not to all Canadians; that represents a very limited view of the concept.
In a democracy, detractors also have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold doesn’t understand – or doesn’t want to understand – is that the public that supports the authors and editors of Noir Canada does so mostly because it rejects the mining’s brutal way.
This public is willing to listen to Barrick and judge him, but on the basis of civilized changes of argument, and not in the framework of what many people perceive as a gag-chase (pursuing the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just filed a requirement regarding the authors of Noir Canada urging them not to use this word anymore).
In addition to Mr. Garver’s surreal speech, the Barrick Gold trial is a direct attack on the freedom of university search and truth, essential to all democratic societies.
It denies the right to cite credible sources and make a debate about the facts and interpretations, which represent the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss subjects that displease the rich companies of this world in a country like Canada, under pain of many persecutions, who will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could do so by following the scientific standards used by the Noir Canada authors.
You have a right of reply.
The university world, to which we belong, has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
The excessive persecution of Barrick Gold clearly shows that, contrary to what he claims, he does not want to have a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the university world, but also for public debate in Canada, and it is high time that governments put in place measures to limit this kind of abusive persecution.
Wall Street rescue operation - Democrats and Republicans agree
The Bush administration and congressional leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, finally agreed yesterday on the most important economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan that aims to curb the financial crisis that has rocked Wall Street for months has yet to be confirmed by both chambers of Congress.
In particular, it provides for better control by the elected officials of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of public money invested, new provisions to contain the number of houses seized for non-payment, as well as a right of control over the salaries paid to the leaders of the companies rescued.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Republican Representative at the negotiating table Senator Judd Gregg announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday, at the end of a two-day marathon of negotiations.
“We are making great progress toward an agreement that will be effective in the markets,” said Bush Administration Representative Henry Paulson.
“Everything has been done to shield the economy and ordinary Americans from the current crisis on Wall Street,” she said.
"It's the bottom line: If we don't do this, the trauma, chaos and disruptions to Americans' daily lives will be immense," said Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had ended very quickly in the last hours because they feared the effect that a new failure in the mood of investors would cause.
The last time they had set was the opening of the markets this morning.
The two candidates in the American presidential elections, who have joined the negotiations late, were rather favorable to the agreement, without forgetting, however, to express their discontent at being forced to reach this extremity.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama was given certain provisions to reach the agreement, particularly the one that would allow owners to keep their domicile and the one on the salary of the leaders of the surviving companies by the state.
“When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary action because of the irresponsibility of some, we should not congratulate ourselves.
But these measures are necessary,” he said on American television.
His Republican opponent, John McCain, asked on another network whether he would vote for the proposed plan, replied: "I'd like to see the details, but I hope to vote on it."
“The important points I read [show] that it is something that we will have to digest and with which we will be able to move forward.
He said the option of doing nothing is not acceptable.”
The $700 billion plan aims to buy with taxpayers’ money the dubious, risky and unsaleable debts of American financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis triggered by the bursting of a housing bubble that first led to the collapse of risky mortgage loans before spreading to other more common forms of credit securities (PCAA) and causing a liquidity freeze and a disbandment of banks and financial institutions.
It is a group of elected Republicans who had changed the first draft agreement last week.
We believe we have come out of the impasse since Democrats accepted that certain “toxic” assets of distressed companies are only insured by the government, rather than purchased.
With the goal of smoothing over the rough edges for everyone in Congress, we also added a provision stipulating that if the government had to assume losses for five years under this program, it could impose new rates that would purport to help it recover money.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first part of 250 billion to which another 100 billion can be added if the president considers it necessary.
The payment of another $350 billion would have to be confirmed by another vote by Congress.
In return for their help, Washington will get stakes in the rescued companies that will earn it dividends in case of profits and that it can resell when the storm passes.
The federal government will have the possibility of delaying foreclosure procedures concerning homes obtained with real estate loans under this plan, as well as setting limits on the remuneration and cash compensation paid to the leaders of the companies affected by the crisis.
The architects of the plan would like to see it submitted to the vote of the House of Representatives from today and to that of the Senate next Wednesday.
Despite all his efforts, he is still not sure that his plan will be approved.
Some people continued to protest yesterday against this bill, both on the part of Republicans and Democrats.
Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee, declared to his constituents that “clearly, Washington does not want to understand.”
"We have a very serious financial problem.
There are solutions.
But not the one that’s about taking advantage of taxpayers.”
Democratic Rep. Brad Sherman, who is a cheerleader for a small group in Congress, presents the problems differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred economics professors, including three Nobel Laureates, wrote to us to tell us: we ask Congress not to hurry and carefully examine the path to be taken,” he declared yesterday.
At this very moment, in Europe, we once again had proof of the global nature of the crisis.
After an urgent meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros ($16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was giving up buying its competitor in bankruptcy since it lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion dollars) during the crisis of risky real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85 000 people and is part of the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
"This is not money lost," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
Instead, we regained a voting right in the bank and influence.
It’s just something savers and families will appreciate now that times are uncertain.”
During this time, across the English Channel, the British government seemed to want to nationalize another bank suffering from the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all outstanding loans at the Bradford and Bringley bank and more than 41 billion euros ($75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it is the one that would buy the branches and bank accounts of the British bank.
The Bradford and Bringley bank would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government would have to nationalize from the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a Compromised Icon
His blue eyes represented his triumph for so long.
The American actor with a charming smile had broken free from his narcissistic side?
Yes and no.
His modesty, his sensitivity and a talent that was evident will also have moved him away from the power record held by true sacred monsters.
What a great runner!
Paul Newman, who died Friday of lung cancer at his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last American movie icons of the heyday.
He is less phenomenal than Brando, who looked a lot like him and who was long considered a rival in cinema, more prudent in his game, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the burst of dramatic conventions.
Mixed bloods often make magnificent children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, to a German Jewish father and a mother of Hungarian origin.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without excessive ego, last mark of quality.
Because in it was projected an entire country in love with the self-made man, the Pacific war fighter, wounded in combat, who at the beginning of the 50s studied the dramatic art at Yale, then frequented the Actor's Studio in New York, before succeeding in the theater, on television and soon in the cinema.
This civil rights man was also the car driver who qualified in second place at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1979, dubbed by a sex symbol, although a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
Also disappear with him the secret sides of this secret star, discreet and committed, allergic to the scandals of the entertainment world that we do not know very well.
He is an honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newman sent moviegoers into a vertigo this weekend, as their big roles clash on the black screen of memories.
More than a half-century of the ever-changing seventh American art parades through it.
Many memories come back as the charming cowboy of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejects his sensual wife (with Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the Zinc Roof adapted from Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to home (1990), we recall his sensitive Mr. Bridge, disturbed by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
Others like Paul Newman have gone down in film history.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Robert Wise’s Somebody Up There Likes Me, a role intended for James Dean, reprised after his death, which truly launched Newman in 1956.
This sympathetic mangante in the sumptuous film The Sting, Oscar for best film in 1973.
A bitter billiard player and avenger in Robert Rossen’s magnificent film The Hustler (1961), he will repeat the character in Martin Scorsese’s The Color of Money, which earned him in 1987 his only Oscar out of nine nominations.
This face that changes with the years, was him.
Still him.
Times change during his career.
Young people know him mostly thanks to George Roy Hill’s Slap Shot (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans saw him again in 1994's The Hudsucker Proxy by the Coen brothers.
With a final role as godfather of the Irish mob in Sam Mendes' Road to Perdition in 2003, the curl was curled.
Contrary to several film legends who abandoned the career quite soon, Newman stayed a long time in the world of cinema, denouncing Hollywood, its golds, its splendours and its concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, with humor, "as a challenge that lives in " the underplaying " and that judges its performances too supported.
The profession was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman to whom the papers came for a long time without doing anything.
However, he played less often the role of young gallant than of marginal: neurotic, alcoholic, bastard or desperate, whose features reflected the rebellions.
As a filmmaker, Newman revealed sides his true pudic sensibility not well known.
Her 1968 film Rachel, Rachel (based on the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the title role, depicted a female portrait of melancholy.
The man who lost his son Scott to an overdose dedicated his film Harry and Son to him in 1984, a work of shame and sadness.
" Among the numerous tributes that were unleashed yesterday for Newman, his great friend and former comrade-in-arms Robert Redford (they had worked together on The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) affirmed, very saddened: " my life and my country were better thanks to its existence "
Generosity, love of existence are important traits of the deceased actor.
On the other side of his legendary career, he also hides a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a protester against the excesses of Hollywood.
We will have seen a lot of his face reign over the jars of vinaigrette sauce, sauces, cookies and other foods, judging this method as a method of bad taste, although it began as a gag.
The proceeds of these sales were given to his Foundation for Children in Distress.
Newman, rather than be content with his myth, will have committed himself to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these phrases: "Always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there.”
And a privilege for us to have followed the career of such a lucid and generous American artist.
In other words, a model citizen.
What did they produce in the invoice factory Zuschlag & Co. ?
Very soon, on October 8, the criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his accomplices will begin.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of committing frauds of significant damage, in a business way, continuously and in an organized way in addition to other crimes, including the forgery of documents.
According to the Prosecutor ' s Office, they used the funds obtained in the public tenders for their own purposes, justifying on many occasions the fulfillment of the tasks with false invoices.
Public and municipal funds - altogether some HUF 65 million - stopped partly in the treasury of the Fiatal Baloldal organisation and partly in the pocket of private individuals.
The method, which was also disclosed by the researchers, was to justify the collection of the funds obtained in the public tenders with false invoices behind which there was no real execution, the different associations never fulfilled their assumed obligations.
According to the indictment, most of the bills were fake.
To do this they obtained the checkbooks in the market of the J<0xC3><0xB3>zsefváros District and the circular stamps were manufactured in the city of Kiskunhalas.
And the question that on behalf of which company the counterfeit invoice should be made was decided among others in that tour through the Upper Region of the Balaton where János Zuschlag sent István Lados.
The latter confessed that for this purpose he had to choose hostels and restaurants.
He asked for an invoice for his consumption and these served as a model for making the invoices that they presented, among others, in the competitions of the Ministry of Youth and Sports Affairs, in the Ministry of Social and Labor Affairs, as well as in the City Council of the Capital.
These invoices were signed mostly by István Lados and his accomplice András <0xC5><0x90>ri, who according to our information rather wrote the reports necessary to obtain the public subsidies.
During one of his "study trips" Lados chose a brewery.
According to two invoices issued in 2003 by Zuschlag and his accomplices, this gastronomic center provided food for a group of ninety people of the Biztos Pont Egyes<0xC3><0xBC>let Association.
However - according to the manager of the center - so many people do not fit at once in that place.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 for the Jobb J<0xC3><0xB6>v<0xC5><0x91>ért Foundation – later called Egy<0xC3><0xBC>tt a Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredérert – was full of formal and contextual errors.
For a hostel in the town of Badacsonytomaj had only three rooms and more than ten people could not stay there in one night, however the bill consisted of one hundred and thirty people.
But the manufacturers of high fantasy bill also exaggerated when they pointed to the gastronomic center Pigal Kft. because in the possession of books of the same - according to information given to the Prosecutor's Office - there were no documents in the name of Jobb J<0xC3><0xB6>v<0xC5><0x91>ért and Hoppá.
Gy<0xC5><0x91>z<0xC5><0x91> Farkas, the manager of that company, informed hvg.hu that when he was summoned by the prosecution and shown the invoices, he already knew that they were fake documents.
"On the seal the name of our company and the NIF appeared in the wrong place."
He added: In addition to the formal problems, it was also not agreed that according to the bill a hundred people were accommodated, since they have only eleven rooms in which not so many people can be accommodated.
In addition, the bill also included meals, while the restaurant has not worked for a long time.
The enthusiastic invoice makers were also not informed that the travel agency chosen in Budapest exclusively organizes trips abroad, so that in the cash payment invoice they foolishly indicated as a service a trip within Hungary, which also did not coincide with the practice of issuing invoices of the agency.
In addition - as was known during the investigation - they included VAT in the document also, despite the fact that trips outside the territory of the European Union were exempt from tax.
Among other things the VAT measure was also incorrect in the four documents issued by the Hotel Révf<0xC3><0xBC>l<0xC3><0xB6>p Kft. for the Jobb J<0xC3><0xB6>v<0xC5><0x91>ért foundation, since the services of this company are not charged with a 25 but only with 15 percent VAT, in addition the employees of the hotel only extended machine-made invoices however the invoice was manual.
In addition the "senders" made other mistakes also, as in the case of a company in which they put on the invoice as an activity carried out the road transport to which - it was known during the investigations of the prosecution - does not make the company founded as an investment consultant.
Also due to formal differences - inadequate format of the invoice, false stamp - it was known that the invoices issued for Egy<0xC3><0xBC>tt to Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tvány, for XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyes<0xC3><0xBC>let and for Biztos Pont are false.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehért<0xC3><0xB3> Sports Camp, whose representatives denied having issued those invoices.
The counterfeiters also did not pay attention to the fact that when the group of Fiatal Városért Egyes<0xC3><0xBC>let was eating there (2001) the HIB Kft. of Ny<0xC3><0xAD>regyháza was in the process of liquidation, that is why the person in charge of the liquidation process - according to our information - denied having issued such a document.
Consciously Issued Invoices
Another group of manufacturers of fake invoices are those who were aware that they should issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tvány Foundation, at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifj<0xC3><0xBA> Szocialisták, issued an invoice in the amount of about four million HUF in the name of the Egy<0xC3><0xBC>tt Foundation to Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért.
The manager of the Collab Kft. - according to the indictment - was convinced by one of the defendants, Ludovic Gy<0xC3><0xB6>rfi, to issue fictitious invoices.
In the same way, the Biogate Kft., currently under liquidation, collaborated with Zuschlag and its accomplices, which in 2003 supplied invoices for an approximate value of five million HUF to the Jobb J<0xC3><0xB6>v<0xC5><0x91>ért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tvány foundation, the Atlasz Egyes<0xC3><0xBC>let association and the V<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>sfeny<0xC5><0x91> economic association Egyes<0xC3><0xBC>let real.
There was no movement of capital either, because later they canceled the prepared invoices but forgot to include this entity in their documents.
The next group of fake bill makers includes those who have some connection to the defendants.
Thus for example Ivan Kubatov was the plaintiff of the Ukrainian manager of the Delta Trio SL based in Budapest, which dealt with the fuel and vehicle trade.
This company issued numerous invoices worth approximately HUF 18 million in the months of October, November and December 2005 on the sale of computer media.
According to the investigation data, these invoices were purchased by Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which has been under liquidation process since 14 September 2005.
The manager of this company was a Romanian to whom Ivan Kubatov should have also sent the documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
We have information that Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that he issued invoices for Atlasz, Hoppá and Egy<0xC3><0xBC>tt to Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tvány on behalf of the company, charging the amount himself.
The Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and the Jos-Investment Bt. were founded by Romanian masons at the express request of Ivan Kubatov.
However, none of the companies actually functioned because - according to the defendant - they did not receive work.
But he took advantage of these companies, since at the request of his accomplice the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who prepared the company’s registration documents, they issued invoices in the name of the companies for the organizations linked to Zuschlag: for the Atlasz and for the Y-Generaci<0xC3><0xB3>.
Kubatov on behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Tri<0xC3><0xB3>, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade gave a total of 15 invoices to different entities for a value of HUF 14.2 million.
The Prosecutor’s Office considered that Kubatov received VAT and 10% of the amount of the invoices.
That man even took advantage of the Szi-Beri partnership to issue fictitious invoices used in the Biztos Pont contest.
The Y-Generation and Sz<0xC3><0xB6>vetség a Modern Magyarországért presented a competition in January 2006 to Táncsics Mihály Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tvány (TMA), a public utility of the Socialist Party.
They obtained 500 thousand HUF respectively from the contest, but did not use the money for the purposes of the contest.
So that this is not discovered, they presented to the TMA five fictitious invoices received from the Works Team Kft.
These were the invoices found during the registration of the office that <0xC3><0x81>rpád Kemecsei had at the headquarters of the Ministry of Education.
Some of the defendants are likely to recount at trial - as they did at the prosecution - the course of falsifying the invoices.
The most interesting thing may be the confession of the main defendant János Zuschlag himself, if he decides to dismantle everything.
For his confessions up to now have not been very detailed and although he repeatedly promised to talk about everything, he has not done so up to the present.
The question is: what interest does he have in doing it?, because perhaps in exchange for the return of most of the money - fifty million HUF - the socialists reached an agreement with him so that Zusi assumes all the responsibilities.
Who, on the other hand, for these days could even be offended, since to alleviate his prison conditions he requested house arrest, but was repeatedly denied.
While the numerous perpetrators of economic crimes of much higher value, who never returned the money, walk freely or at least can wait in their own home for the sentence, he has no chance for that.
Psychology of Overlapping: Why Do We Spend More Money?
Auction participants are likely to spend more money and overvalue the product.
Neurologists and economists at New York University discovered the neurological-economic underpinnings of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to the study published in the journal Science, people do not want to lose in competitions such as eBay auctions, so they prefer to pay even an excessive price.
The scientists tried to establish the neurological scheme of this "game" through experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers played lottery, the other participated in an auction and in the meantime the active areas of the brain of the people participating in the experiment were examined using the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) system.
In both games participants could earn money, but during the auctions, where it is fundamental to bet more than the other, losing the game intensified the operation of the complex called stratum located under the cerebral cortex.
This area of the brain, in addition to many other functions, plays a role in the “self-prize” mechanism of the nervous system.
Thus, according to the scientists, the increase in bets is explained as a prevention so as not to provoke an intense reaction of the stratum.
To substantiate their theory, the economists of the scientific group also carried out a financial follow-up study.
In this experiment three groups bet against a person in different circumstances.
The control group was simply told the actual value of the product in question, and its members bet.
Another group was also promised that if they won, they would receive an additional $15 in prize money.
Instead, the third group received exactly $15 before the auction, but in case of losing the auction the members of the group lost even that money.
So the only difference between the two groups was that for one the triumph was highlighted and for the other the failure.
However, testing the neurologists’ hypothesis, group members who played “against failure” were willing to bet even more than members of the control group and the “winner” group.
“These results cannot be inferred from any previously existing economic theory.
For those until now explained the phenomena of auctions only with the joy of winning and with the prevention of risks.
Only visual neurological methods helped resolve this contradiction between the two theories, so we now come to a third explanation,” said Andrew Schotter, a professor at New York University’s School of Economics.
Hepatitis: When should I go to the doctor?
Around 500 million people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary chronic liver disease is considered one of the leading causes of death.
It is estimated that 100,000 people are infected in this country, but only 7,000 receive treatment because many of the patients do not know they are infected.
The term hepatitis is the common name for different liver diseases caused by viruses.
The symptoms are very similar; liver infection and jaundice are characteristic, but their pathogenic agents and the diseases caused are very different.
Hepatitis viruses in dependence on the pathogen are spread by two main forms: hepatitis A and E by food (for example with water or contaminated food), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and with body humors (sperm, vaginal humor, saliva).
It is advisable for travelers to protect themselves with vaccines against virus A and B, against C there are no vaccines.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear two or three weeks after consuming the infected food, it is manifested by poor general condition, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After that jaundice appears on the skin and on the whites of the eyes, the excrement becomes clear, dark-colored urine and healing can last even two - three weeks.
Every year one million people worldwide die from liver cancer and cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B, the most serious forms of this disease.
The main reason for this is that according to the calculations, only one in ten infected receives pharmacological treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: without treatment it can lead to liver cirrhosis and even cancer.
Most of the infected do not know that they are sick because this pathological agent gradually destroys the liver cells and often the first symptoms appear only 20-30 years later.
Therefore, early recognition, systematic medical control is very important.
This disease is much more common in three groups: people who had blood transfusions before 1991, drug users and those who have tattoos.
There are currently about 200 million people in the world with chronic hepatitis C.
As this disease can be discovered with a routine laboratory check-up as well, it is worth consulting with the family doctor when experiencing any unknown symptoms.
The disease has a cure if it is discovered in time, it is possible to exterminate the virus from the organism, so it can suppress the contagion and prevent cancer.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, which was first organized in 2004 by organizations representing the sick.
It aims to draw attention to the causes of chronic liver infections caused by viruses and the importance of their early recognition.
Does it hurt less those who believe in God?
According to the result of recent research, religious faith has a calming effect that also alleviated the death of the martyrs of Catholicism.
Scientists from the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment: they analyzed that religious belief in which way influences human pain - reported the British newspaper Telegraph.
As part of this unique experiment, 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists were given electric shocks while everyone was looking at a painting of the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude most of their pain.
Thanks to the technique of scanning the human brain, it was possible to verify that the Catholic believers were able to activate that part of their brain that is responsible for the regulation of pain.
This experiment is the first in a series of investigations in which, together with academics, scientists, philosophers and theologians from the different departments of the University also participate.
The analysis took place as follows; they fixed a sparkling instrument to the left hand of the patient, which applied the electric shock.
The researchers asked the participants of the experiment to fix their gaze on two paintings; the Virgin Mary, a 17th-century work by Sassoferrato and Leonardo da Vinci’s Lady with an Ermine from the 15th century.
The researchers hoped that the spectacle of the Virgin Mary would provoke a certain religious mood among the faithful, while they chose Leonardo’s oil because it was not too different from the other, and thought that it had a reassuring effect.
Patients spent half an hour on an MRI scanner, receiving 20 electric shocks in four successive parts while watching either the religious-themed painting or the other.
The Catholics said that when they looked at the Virgin Mary they felt "secure" as "protected" people, "they calmed down and peace reigned in their hearts."
Looking at the religious-themed painting, they felt 12 percent less pain than when they looked at Leonardo’s work.
The psychologist Miguel Farias who also participated in the experiment, thinks that with any image so shocking you can get a similar effect with atheists too, you just have to find the right image.
"We should find the portrait of a person for whom they feel very positively, as for a mother or a father," - said the psychologist.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the outcome of the inquiry.
“The exercise of faith should and in many cases does change our personality,” Wright said.
After these formidable results, only one question remains: what effect would it have on the regulation of pain if the faithful were shown the Madonna of Leonardo or of another painter of his stature?
Would the vision of a high-quality Virgin Mary yield even better results?
You are what you say about yourself
On its tenth birthday, Google can say: it can be found both in people’s pockets and in the sky above their heads; it knows where they spent their holidays, which doctors they visit and what they are interested in.
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company’s executives, this is still not enough.
On the other hand, skeptics who draw a parallel with the Orwellian view do not see the essence of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google’s main goal is to gather as much personal data about its users as possible, and this is necessary in order to meet the original goals of Google’s founders: “Let’s bring together all the information in the world in one system!”
According to the leader of Google, the company even after ten years of work that revolved the world is still in the initial phase of the effort to be able to process all the information.
To the question what is going to happen in five years Schmidt answered like this: I would like Google to be able to answer questions like “What to do tomorrow?” or “What would be the job that would be best for me?” - however, software will not be able to answer seemingly so simple questions as long as there is not enough information from users.
Not all Internet users are aware that during their browsing on the Internet the searched keywords, IP addresses and the pages where they went at the end of the search are accurately stored.
Thanks for example to Personalized Search that debuted two years ago, users can store their own browsing history, can re-check what they were looking for before, what they opened and thanks to this history will generate much more personalized searches - in this same logic will be based the Recommendations, in which the system will offer us products and services based on the preferences previously defined and stored.
What will happen if they take advantage of my data against myself, if they collect information about my activities? - ask those users who worry about seeing the information monopoly of Google.
In most cases rather the potential represented by the company is what can be fearful and not remorse, fear of punishment, yearning for freedom or rebellion against power.
However, it is a fact already confirmed that not only retain, but in justifiable cases also cede to third parties all the sought expressions, in these cases there is nothing that protects the personal rights of Internet users.
The most debated example of recent times was perhaps the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, when Google handed over to the Brazilian government the information from its website, called Orkut, to identify pedophiles.
On the other hand, Internet users who are concerned about the rights of people, in the month of May were relieved when the company together with the EFF, organization for the defense of electronic rights, proved successfully before the court that it was right in its litigation with the FBI: according to the ruling, it will not be able to force Google, through any of the points of the constitution to provide any type of information requested in secret by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government managed to get under the pretext of strengthening the child protection law passed years ago, about fifty thousand Web addresses and about a thousand searched phrases, but without obtaining the search lists of individual users, nor the complete lists of Web pages and keywords of the last two months.)
This is how the opinion about Google is quite contradictory: it is criticized by those who are afraid to provide their personal data because they think that their privacy is harmed when they start using Google services, and they rebel against it as against multinational companies with a conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its enthusiastic followers, netizens and users from other countries, see in them the future generation, the "avant-garde corporation", not so its rival, Microsoft, cataloged by its Windows as conqueror of the World, no matter how much they both fight for the same goal.
This can happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask users for any identification code, nor money for their applications, the code is open and the free program package, constantly updated and seems more youthful, more collaborative than the practice of the official software giant.
But it may also be because geeks see precisely the very problematic relationship between people’s rights and the Internet that was produced precisely by one of the most mentioned keywords in recent years: Web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is about collaboration, about leaving intentional footprints behind us and leveraging available communication channels, and while the measures of these vary individually, the essence remains the same: showing ourselves.
A normal young person can have a profile on numerous collective pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and can even join them with other services, such as Twitter or the last.fm that offers a list of their music habits, then these can be included in a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, you can also have a blog, in which the latest photo galleries that are stored in the Pi automatically appear.
We can know numerous cases from which it follows that for example the bride, seeing the flow of photographs of the next morning from common friends, finds out with whom she spent the previous night her fraudulent boyfriend or they can dismiss the employee of a company because he writes his sincere opinion on his blog about the direction of the company: one thing is certain, the definition of private life was completely revalued.
A person's life "on line" is what he shows of himself - this is the definition that hides behind the conduct of today's youth.
And the one who wants to hide something, or at least intends to dodge Google’s monopoly, can do so (starting for example with the Scroogle that uses Google’s search system, but leaves no traces).
There are many people who do not want to register on the collective pages to prevent them from being found, but they can replace Google's "on line" applications, from text writing software to image and news reading applications with alternative versions which do not connect with gigantic servers or prepare the most perfect profile possible about us.
Public opinion is almost openly waiting for the day when Google shows its true face.
The company with its current value of 156 billion dollars is worth more than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca-Cola (110 billion dollars), the advertising surfaces of AdWords / AdSense threaten the revenues of advertising agencies, while the services that are introduced increasingly quickly also cause serious headaches not only for Microsoft software, but also for other developers.
Critical observers, however, will find the contradictions alarming as well: for example, the top management flatly rejected the employees’ protest after doubling the price of the company’s childcare, they considered the unlimited number of employees’ food too expensive, but all this is nothing compared to the fact that in 2006 the Chinese regime violated good interests and the company under the agreement leaked all the moral information.
One of the internal regulations of the company says that they will not announce any new service in advance, but only when it was already ready to operate, which if it is certain is that the foreseeable problems of the coming months and years will be able to revolve around the World: while some believe that the project of scanning and archiving of books and magazines of Google we can create such full dimensions that the company will soon be cited by the Supreme Court of the United States, others fear of their own health problems.
And the fact that Google is going to create a genetic database, will be able to provide a good raw material for science fiction writers, the Scroogled, novel by the popular Cory Doctorow, describes in Orwellian form that future, in which a man only of the Google data can be described alarmingly well.
Two minors helped erase the fingerprints of the author of the double murder of the city of <0xC3><0x93>zd.
Police questioned two minors about the double murder of <0xC3><0x93>zd who, according to well-founded suspicion, helped erase the traces of the crime - said on Tuesday the spokesman of the General Police Station of Public Order of the province of Borsod.
The young women recognized the crime that was charged against them, and they are currently being accused of having committed the crime.
The two minors - according to the Hungarian News Agency, these are two girls - will be able to defend themselves in freedom.
For complicity they can receive up to 5 years in prison.
The accused of the double murder of <0xC3><0x93>zd - a 23-year-old man - has been in pre-trial detention since Sunday.
He is charged with the crime of murdering several people with premeditation and greed.
During the investigation, it was revealed that the 23-year-old owed a large sum to a 53-year-old man.
The defendant did not want to pay his debt, so on Wednesday last week he summoned his creditor to the headquarters of an <0xC3><0x93>zd company, where he killed him and then also killed the victim’s 9-year-old daughter.
According to information from the MTI, the young man prepared much earlier to perpetrate the crime, as he committed the murder with a weapon previously hidden at the scene of the crime.
The police analyze with an expert the weapon and the circumstances of its use.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has submitted an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered two hundred million euros - about five billion Czech crowns - for one hundred percent of the shares of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange confirmed the offer made by the Poles, despite the fact that the Czechs have previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from possible new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which within a few months wants to sell 60 percent of them.
The Czech economic daily E15 reported that the offer of Poles has been the highest among those offered by those interested by the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Transatlantic Stock Exchange Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche B<0xC3><0xB6>rse have so far been offered.
Petr Koblic, the head of the Prague Stock Exchange, declared last week that among the interested parties the worst new owner would be the Warsaw Stock Exchange and did not rule out the possibility that with it, in the future, the Prague Stock Exchange would disappear.
Experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at about 5 to 10 billion kroner.
Under the shareholders’ agreement, approximately 90 percent of the shares could be sold.
The majority owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is investment bank Patria Finance with a stake of approximately 25 percent, followed by Bank Ceská Sporitelna with 14.7 percent and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
On the financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
Europe’s leading newspapers in their Tuesday comments on the deepening international financial crisis speak of a “second 9/11.”
The global financial catastrophe is due to the American president - the Republic of Rome opines - the president has not been able even to get the support of his own party for the bill made hastily, whose objective is to give solution to this desperate situation...
Instead of a new “Pearl Habor,” which billionaire investor Warren Buffett was talking about, it is more correct to speak of a “second 9/11.”
According to a part of the Madrid press, Washington is the scapegoat.
In the opinion of El Mundo, it was the mistake of the political leadership of the United States that brought the world economy to the brink of the abyss.
The danger of the collapse of the U.S. monetary system is growing, and this will then have an impact on the entire world.
Although Bush’s plan was not perfect, after the Congressional vote there is a danger that Washington does not offer a political instrument to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in mid-air – just as one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
This threat cannot be ignored - says the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva.
Some states today can still throw life belts at wobbly financial institutions, thus saving them from bankruptcy with taxpayer money.
But if as the dominoes crumble even more, then neither the new funds nor the new improvisations will be enough.
In the long term, it is necessary for the member states of the European Union to put aside their nationalistic selfishness and centralize control over fragmented financial markets.
Financial institutions in crisis received just on Monday more than 100 billion euros - recalls the Viennese Der Standard, adding that concerns are increasingly real that, as the Americans did, European taxpayers will also have to pay a lot of money to solve the crisis.
The EU has so far not seriously dealt with the crisis that passes like a wedge across the Old Continent.
The “saviors” will not have to immediately present hundreds of millions of euros, but it would be good if they defined: in which cases is it justified to use taxpayer funds to avoid a greater evil?
Smart car mimics the flight of the bumblebee
What would be the best method to develop technologies in order to avoid collisions, if not the imitation of existing obstacle sensors in nature?
For example, the bumblebees.
In a startling project presented at CEATEC in Japan, the bumblebees provided the starting point for Nissan engineers to design the next generation of collision prevention systems.
Nissan, in cooperation with the University of Tokyo, designed the robotic steering system of cars type BR23C imitator of nature, to which they gave the characteristics of bumblebees, with the ultimate goal of creating a system that can dodge all collisions.
During the flight each bumblebee creates its own particular oval space that actually looks a lot like our safety protective capsule - explained in the exhibition Kazuhhiro Doi, technological director of RP and development and research.
The compound eyes of bumblebees that are able to see in all directions at an angle greater than 300 degrees play an important role.
To copy the function of compound eyes, the engineers used the laser beam length measurement system.
It identifies obstacles in front of the BR23C within a distance of 2 meters, at an angle of 180 degrees, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the microprocessor of the vehicle that immediately transforms into a maneuver to avoid the collision.
In a fraction of a second the obstacle is identified, then the robot of the vehicle imitating the movements of the bumblebees, modifies the direction by turning the wheels as necessary.
Unlike any existing system, this maneuver is totally instinctive.
“If this were not the case, the vehicle’s robot would not be able to react quickly enough to dodge obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the vehicle robot project.
It must react immediately and instinctively, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable inner layer of the safety protective capsule, in a layer within which all types of collisions are currently considered inevitable.
The whole process should reflect what a bumblebee does to dodge other bumblebees.
This process should be done in a blink of an eye.
However, unlike bumblebees, the movement cannot be directed upwards, downwards or diagonally, but can only be two-dimensional and exclusively in the direction of rotation of the wheels.
In this way, instead of the infinite possibilities that exist for bumblebees to dodge other bumblebees, here they only used rotary motion and acceleration in addition to braking as a possibility for the car robot.
The BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and have a higher energy density, which means they have a longer lifespan than lithium-ion batteries.
According to Andoh, the important thing is the instinctive and intelligent reaction and not the ability to process the data, let alone the storage.
This device should only process a few input signals every second and react accordingly.
It is not necessary to store this data or react with an instinctive logic based on the data of the previous maneuvers, so it uses only a few tens of kilobytes of memory.
There is no need for gigabytes or megabytes of memory.
This is the first step to develop the technology to immediately dodge obstacles, which according to Nissan’s calculations, in ten years can be incorporated into mass-produced models.
Another possibility for its application is to incorporate the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system to take the driver to his destination, dodging existing obstacles in his way.
This little boy has a name.
The written version of the law of the $700 billion financial rescue package has been prepared, which will be applied in several phases in order to buy the bad loans of the banks.
In the first phase, half of the money will be spent.
According to the schedule of the East Coast during the new consultations that lasted until after midnight on Saturday, the leaders of the congress reached an agreement around the financial rescue package of 700 billion dollars in total, after several days of discussion - reported Reuters.
“We have made significant progress,” said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic president of the U.S. Congress, adding that the agreement only needs to be formalized in a document.
The commitment made on the package was supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Henry Paulson, the finance minister, speaking on the outcome of the compromise said: this program will work and will be efficient but other measures are needed. According to Pelosi, it is not about saving Wall Street, but about turning the cart of the economy.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of Asian markets, that is, on Sunday before 8 p.m., according to Washington time (that is, before 2 a.m. on Monday, according to Central European time), without causing a spectacular jump in the stock markets.
On the bill called the 2008 emergency law for economic stabilization, the U.S. Congress will vote first on Monday, and then the Senate.
President George W. Bush on Saturday night consulted with Pelosi and then the White House also celebrated the news about the deal.
“We are pleased with the progress made overnight and highly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy,” White House spokesman Tony Fratto said in a statement.
The program is different from the Bush administration’s original proposal to spend all $700 billion to buy bad credit fund securities.
Now only half of the $700 billion can be spent, using $250 billion immediately after Congress votes, probably on Monday, of this sum the Ministry of Finance will buy securities credit fund, bad rating and the fate of another $100 billion depends on the decision of the president.
This program will be controlled by a special agency, in which the president of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The other half of the $700 billion could be spent after a new congressional decision.
According to the law, the Ministry of Finance can apply a combined tactic: it will be able to simultaneously buy bad loans, mortgages and securities of credit fund, in addition to other "poisonous" loans as well.
The purchase can be made in auctions or directly - informed competent people of the ministry.
The law allows affected companies to participate in an insurance program where the financial portfolio guarantees the worrying elements, for which the companies will pay the amount corresponding to the foreseeable damages.
Henry Paulson said: the law ensures the necessary financial means, which can even reach 700 billion dollars to meet the urgent needs of the American financial system, whether it is the purchase of bad financial means, their insurance or the prevention of risks that could cause the collapse of some large financial institutions.
We do everything necessary to be ready to introduce the law as soon as they sign it - he added.
On the other hand, the heads of the banks that are in trouble and waiting for state aid will be able to count on the official limitation of their indemnities, which the American slang simply calls golden parachutes.
Only in certain cases will payments be limited, and the limitations depend on the form of aid provided by the Ministry of Finance.
The limitation means that if the ministry buys at auction, an extra tax will be imposed on gold parachutes, unless the failed bank chief retires.
By buying the bad credits directly, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that compensation from the bosses is not exaggerated.
In addition to the above, existing gold parachute contracts will not be changed, the limitations refer only to new contracts to stimulate participation in the program.
This is the first case in U.S. history that a legal limit on CEOs’ incomes will be in place, said Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the congressional committee responsible for financial services.
The State will also have the right to acquire shares of the banks participating in the program, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, since ultimately they can even profit from the transaction as soon as the economy recovers and with it the bank.
Under the bill, the president will have to present a proposal to Congress over the next five years on how to return financial sector losses to taxpayers.
Of course, there were those on both sides who expressed reservations about the project.
This is not what the American people have entrusted to us, that is, they are not protecting taxpayers’ dollars,” said California Republican Congressman Darrell Issa.
Her fellow Ohio Democrat, Mary Kaptur, said the measures were urged by those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continue to rise
In August 2008 domestic industrial sales prices increased by 0.1 percent compared to last month's prices and by 12.9 percent compared to August 2007 prices - reported the Central Bureau of Statistics (KSH).
Industrial export prices rose 1.1 percent from July 2008 and fell 3.9 percent from a year earlier.
And as a result of changes in domestic and export prices, industrial production prices increased by 0.7 percent from the previous month and by 3.2 percent from the previous year.
Industrial selling prices rose only marginally, by 0.1 percent.
Domestic selling prices of the processing industry sectors increased minimally, by 0.1 percent compared to July.
The largest increase in the magnitude of prices occurred in August 2008, in the leather and footwear production sector (2.8 percent), due primarily to the 4.6 percent monthly increase in bags and belts and the 2.5 percent increase in footwear.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical base materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in the prices of the chemical materials production branch (1.6 percent).
There was a price decrease in the petrochemical sector, (1.4 percent), in the production of electrical machines and instruments (0.9 percent), as well as - to a minimum extent - in the wood processing sectors (0.1 percent).
They did not change the prices of papermaking, publishing houses and printing presses.
In the rest of the sectors of the processing industry there was an increase in prices between 0.2 and 0.9 percent.
In the supply of electricity, gas, heat and water, which represent an important weight within domestic trade, there was an increase of 0.3 percent in August, first of all due to the effect of the increase in official prices from July 1.
In a twelve-month comparison - in domestic sales of the processing industry sectors - the largest price increase was recorded in the petrochemical sector (32.4 percent).
In the metal processing sector an increase of 13.2 percent was observed, while in the food, beverage and tobacco industry, of determining weight, there was an increase of 11 percent.
There was a decline in prices in the textile industry (2.5 percent), as well as in the manufacture of electrical machines and instruments (0.3 percent).
In the rest of the processing sectors, the pace of price growth was between 0.6 and 9.1 percent.
During the past year in the processing industry globally, prices increased by 10.2 percent.
Prices for electricity, gas, heat and water supply were 18.7 percent higher than the previous year’s prices.
In August, among the different sectors of domestic trade, the largest monthly increase in prices (0.7 percent) was recorded in the investment goods sectors.
In the consumer goods sectors, prices increased by 0.3 percent, while prices in the energy sector and intermediary sectors remained unchanged from the previous month.
In August 2008, compared to the same month of the previous year, the largest price increase occurred in the energy sectors and in the intermediary industry (16.8 percent).
In the branches producing consumer goods, there was a decrease of 6.8 percent and in investment goods 1.4 percent.
The industry’s export prices calculated in HUF increased by 1.1 percent over the previous month, and compared to 12 months, there was a decrease of 3.9 percent.
The price of our national currency in one month decreased by 1.7 percent against the euro and by 7.1 percent against the dollar, compared to August 2007 strengthened by 7.5 percent against the euro and 15.9 percent against the dollar.
Will you no longer need a visa to go to the United States next year?
Kinga G<0xC3><0xB6>ncz believes that there are many possibilities for the US-Hungarian visa waiver agreement to enter into force around January 12 - the foreign minister spoke about it in Chicago, before the Hungarians living there.
In his opinion "virtually everything depends on the timely construction of the electronic access and control system on the other side of the Atlantic".
At the same time he warned that in the new system the entrance premise will disappear, but tourists before their departure from the country of origin will have to register.
As of today, the head of Hungarian diplomacy is holding talks in Washington.
He will meet with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, awarding her the Median Cross with the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary, and hold negotiations with the international policy advisers of the presidential candidates, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Both Barack Obama and McCain are in favor of the bank bailout package.
Barack Obama and John McCain, both presidential candidates of the two major American parties on Sunday assured their support for the program of banking aid of 700 million dollars of the administration, instead there are politicians who demand the resignation of the Minister of Finance.
Representatives of Congress and the administration, after several marathon-style days of negotiations, announced early Sunday: an agreement in principle was reached on the financial rescue package of the banks.
The financial package to solve the Wall Street crisis and unfreeze the frozen credit market became the central theme of the presidential election campaign.
Both Obama and McCain want to show that they are more capable than their rival to pull the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, when economic issues came to the fore, Obama again gained some advantage and McCain’s advantage that he had obtained after the Republican convention with Sarah Palin’s candidacy for the vice presidency disappeared.
At a Detroit campaign rally on Sunday, Obama expressed hope that Congress would quickly pass the law on the $700 billion package.
He stressed that the proposal includes those points of consumer protection, which he himself supported.
"We have to act now and with responsibility ... you put at risk the jobs, the savings of entire industries and the stability of the entire economy," he told a crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not miss the opportunity to call McCain’s economic concepts obsolete.
In an interview with ABC, McCain explained that "we're all going to swallow this hard... but doing nothing is just not a viable path."
The Republican senator said that the proposal includes the establishment of a control commission to the minister of fines and limiting the compensation of executives, he was the one who insisted on that.
Obama told CBS that McCain did not play any major role in the consultations, instead he consulted with the minister on a daily basis.
Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi said Sunday that Congress will likely vote as early as Monday on the bill.
Press review of the German-speaking area
The right-wing group is intact, only within the group itself became the most conscious voters - states Der Spiegel on the weak electoral result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider and his supporters are ready to rule in Austria to prevent a red-and-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the electronic edition of the left-wing German magazine Franz Walter, in his article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution devours its parents" he analyzes the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU had begun long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo had taken office.
For several decades the Social-Christians were developing Bavaria - and now it is precisely these modern citizens who are turning their backs on it.
The change of an era is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, as well as Angela Merkel.
The failure was not entirely surprising for the CSU, but on Sunday a process that had already been foreseen for almost ten years ended: the indisputable hegemony of a state party disappeared.
Ten years ago, in 1998 the CSU got 47.7 percent, for the first time below 50 percent since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago, in the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is, even during the aforementioned Stoiber era.
The reason for this is the consistent modernization of the CSU in the devouring province of its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but at the pace they were very wrong. However, secularization, the results of education and the settlement of North Germans in the developed regions of Bavaria had their negative consequences on the fidelity of the voters of the CSU.
Modernisation also increases the possibilities, and this also has political consequences.
The right-wing group is intact, only within the group itself became the most conscious, the most critical and the most stubborn voters.
It is surprising that in recent weeks it has been precisely the conventional groups of citizens who have moved further away from the CSU; the self-employed, the small industrialists, those with a high school diploma and the graduates.
This reduced support for the CSU to less than 40 percent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The conservative Vienna newspaper: "Who with whom? In its article entitled "The presidents of the parties are very secretive in coalition matters" - deals with the confusing situation of domestic politics after the Austrian elections.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP prohibits the SP<0xC3><0x96> from interfering in its internal affairs.
The BZ<0xC3><0x96> is open in all directions to negotiate, while the Greens do not want to consult on the coalition.
Elections were already held, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate held on public television, the leaders of the parties barely showed any of their decks.
Werner Faymann, the president of the SP<0xC3><0x96>, confirmed that he wants to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to show that collaboration between the two parties is possible - this already exists in some provinces and social associations.
Fayman left open the question whether he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the <0xC3><0x96>VP, in the post of vice-chancellor.
He stated that in any case they disapproved of the Sch<0xC3><0xBC>ssel-Molterer era.
It is not possible to follow this political trend.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the red offers.
He said that cooperation will surely not be successful if Faymann tries to meddle in the internal affairs of the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
It is still open in the party whether they will elect the opposition or enter the coalition, these issues must be discussed without a doubt, within the <0xC3><0x96>VP itself.
BZ<0xC3><0x96> President J<0xC3><0xB6>rg Haider was open in all directions.
"To prevent the red-black coalition, we are willing to take responsibility for the government," Haider said.
Jár<0xC3><0xB3>ka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today the European Summit for Equal Opportunities has begun in Paris, its host is France, which this year is also the current President of the European Union.
L<0xC3><0xAD>via Jár<0xC3><0xB3>ka, Member of the European People's Party for Fidesz, in her message addressed to the plenary, as one of the main speakers of this professional meeting, drew attention to segregation in education, because it is one of the most serious violations that hit Roma children and is also the biggest obstacle to the foundation of their interests.
This high-level conference was opened - on behalf of the French Presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs and by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
The meeting was attended by representatives of governments, European social partners and representatives of the most important European organisations for the protection of social rights.
Jár<0xC3><0xB3>ka - according to the press office of the Fidesz group of deputies in the European Parliament - warned that in addition to discrimination in employment, Roma are left out of the labor market in the first place because of their low level of education.
“The majority of young Roma have not finished secondary education and due to the poor quality of basic education, only an insignificant part can obtain a university diploma.”
Jár<0xC3><0xB3>ka also stressed that education, as a fundamental human right, has a determining role in the prevalence of other human rights as well.
Investing in the education of Roma children at an early age can strengthen the economy of EU Member States.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to raise awareness of these issues among both Roma and non-Roma.
For the earlier a Roma student starts school, the more chances he has to become an active member of the labour market; through income and consumption taxes they will also contribute to the national budget.
"Gypsies, as citizens of the European Union, must be guaranteed the right to a quality education and ensure the abolition of segregated and low-level education" - stressed Livia Jaroka.
According to the MEP, the objective and active unity of the European Union is necessary to immediately accelerate the processes of school desegregation, for this it is of fundamental importance the correct compliance with the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives.
"We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, we must offer Roma children the possibility that guarantees the democratic space so that they can contribute to the future of Europe as full citizens" - demanded Jaroka.
The aim of the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, organised annually since last year's Berlin meeting under the banner of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities", is to ensure a unique forum to promote the abolition of discrimination and equal opportunities at European and national level in the Member States.
UHC: grace for a transitional period
At the end of October a decision will be made on the fate of the failed duo Huber-Beckstein
Despite the serious electoral defeat, heads have not yet been cut off at the summits of the Bavarian CSU, for the moment the debate on personal issues has been postponed.
Erwin Huber, chairman of the party and G<0xC3><0xBC>nther Beckstein, provincial prime minister still remain in their posts, but it is not known how long the grace will last.
The fate of the duo, who suffered a catastrophic 17 percent electoral defeat, will be decided at the party’s extraordinary congress to be held last weekend in October.
The members of the much-criticized duo hinted: they don’t hold on to their jobs as much.
In doing so, they sought to reassure the angry members of their parliamentary group and grassroots organization, who a day after the “Bavarian tsunami” demanded personal consequences due to the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - although under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber who was at the peak of his career - the Christian Social Union reached 60.7 percent, instead now, a year after the crowded coup against Stoiber, they got only 43.4 percent.
The CSU for 46 years had "monopoly" in Bavaria giving 18 percent of German GDP.
Although in the southern province, of key importance to the Hungarian economy, conservatives continue to predominate, in the future they will undoubtedly have to coalition with someone.
As a first sign of the party’s restructuring, Vice President Horst Seehofer, the Federal Minister of Agriculture, one of Huber’s possible successors, also has a place in the small intelligence group that is starting negotiations with the liberal FDP and the right-wing Free Voters on a possible government coalition in Munich.
The strange thing about the fate of the Free Voters is that Gabriele Pauli, whose performance against Stoiber was taken advantage of by the coup of the Huber-Beckstein duo and then cruelly erased from the stage the ambitious local politics, enters the parliament.
The top leaders of the CSU are now investing all their energies to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transition Stoiber will also receive an active role that until now was moving the strings in the background, the former head of provincial government and former president of the CSU qualified September 28 as the most bitter day of his political career.
On Monday Huber made some critical remarks to the CDU, in his opinion they would have deserved much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel herself as well.
After the September 2009 Bundestag elections, Merkel will not be able to be chancellor if they are not able to enhance together the CSU which played a momentous role in the successes of the 2005 national elections.
According to Merkel, who could hardly hide her disappointment at the failure, the losses of the CSU will not have a negative impact on the Berlin grand coalition.
Which of course is relative: it will not be easier to treat the wounded CSU and the crisis of the social democrats continues.
The SPD with its 18.6 percent reached its worst result since 1946 in Bavaria.
Lukashenko's opposition: 110-0
After Sunday’s elections, there will be no opposition MPs in the Belarusian parliament.
According to Russian observers, this is explained by the well-being and stability that Alexander Lukashenko guarantees in the country, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained rather by the violations of the law committed during the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the election result.
While the country's 10 million-strong legislature, made up of 10 percent of deputies, has had no opposition for more than a decade, before yesterday's elections the united opposition under the name of United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) hoped that Lukashenko, who for the fourth time renewed his mandate after the 2006 elections of dubious legitimacy, as a result of the amendment of the Constitution this time "allowed"
Thus the ODSZ suppressed the boycott it originally wanted to do.
At the heart of the opposition's expectations was that Belarus, which is increasingly economically dependent on Russia - which took a loan to moderate the import of natural gas increasingly expensive in Russia and which contributed to the sale to Russia of the Beltransgaz, owner of the pipeline that passes through the country - wanted to improve its relations with the European Union, which does not give entry to Lukashenko and the others.
It was a sign of détente when the OSCE, in assessing the election campaign, placed emphasis rather on positive phenomena and not on mistakes - such as the ban on participation imposed on a third of opposition candidates.
However, the OSCE's primary report on Monday criticized even the campaign itself - in which opposition candidates could not appear in the press - and especially that the opposition could not be present at the vote count.
All this, in the opinion of the opposition, is an improvement in the political climate: the political prisoners have been released and Minsk is ready for a small confrontation with Moscow, denying the recognition of the separation of South Ossetia and Abkhazia from Georgia, although Russia - with which Belarus theoretically constitutes a federal state - has considered the two regions as independent a month ago.
- We have taken two steps forward and one backward, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the European Union has started - Alexandr Milinkevich told our newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate of the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable to maintain this situation, despite the fact that "the regime is afraid to allow the entry of even one opponent into that parliament without weight".
The opposition does not plan to organize protests on seeing the results, but rather tries to get the message to voters about the need for economic reforms.
- This clearly causes us a lot of problems because we must print the opposition press in Russia, the local authorities put difficulties in their distribution, but even so I see that more and more are those who support change among adults also - said Milinkevich, alluding to the Lukashenko regime, which believes that its main result is the creation of social security, not consider it appropriate even the retirees, those who are officially sub
Due to the country's indebtedness and the growing trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the breakdown of social security that "looks like the silence of cemeteries" - Milinkevich opined.
Russian observers, unlike the opposition politician, described the elections as democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the Commonwealth of Independent States mission, told Russia's Ria Novosti news agency: "People don't believe in words but in deeds," so the lack of opposition is nothing more than testimony to the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on you eat more breakfast before you start working"
It has never happened in the history of Palacio Chigi that they put automatic doors to control the entry and exit of the staff.
but from today it begins with this measure against those who sign and then goes to the bar to have a coffee during working hours.
This news was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta and by the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"Automatic doors - says Brunetta - are an instrument to work better, with greater productivity, more presence and more services" specifies the minister.
“A new season of accountability and transparency is now opening.
This is Reformism,” Brunetta stresses again.
With Palacio Chigi the installation in all the buildings of the Presidency of the Council is completed.
For Masi "the choice of automatic doors is also important from a symbolic point of view".
No resistance has been found on the part of the employees, says the secretary general: "it has been a change shared by the workers and there was collaboration on their part."
In short, no more breakfast during working hours; no more coffee and crescents.
Brunetta’s word, which suggests, smiling, “a good cappuccino at 7 in the morning is a holy hand.”
During a convention at the Higher School of Public Administration
“In three months, the sick leave of public employees has been reduced by 50%, which means 60,000 more people to work in a year.”
And he adds that it is necessary to make the Public Administration more effective
In Italy, “wage dynamics over the last 8-10 years have been double with respect to the private sector and well above the rate of inflation.”
For now, millions of public employees have joined together to oppose the rules of the Brunetta decree by adhering to the petition supported by the Codacons.
"While the Minister of the Civil Service shows the numbers, the lower absenteeism from work due to illness - writes the Consumers' Association - the people of the 'vague workers' is constantly increasing.
In Italy, millions of correct and productive civil servants have joined together to declare war on the illegitimate norms of the decree.
In particular, the Tar will answer the exclusion of economic treatments added by illness due to service; the extension of the time slots in which the medical control visits of the sick employee are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions wanted by the minister.
Accidents at work, Napolitano: "Crucial prevention"
Every day, in Italy, 2,500 accidents are verified at work, 3 people die and 27 are permanently disabled.
For 2007, the Inail data effectively confirm that white deaths have been approximately 1,200.
Figures that testify to the seriousness of a phenomenon that is one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
To draw the attention of institutions, social forces and the media to this dramatic issue, today Anmil celebrates in all the provinces of Italy the 58th national day for the victims of work accidents, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
“The worrying data disseminated by Anmil and the same tragic news of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is,” said the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the president of Anmil, a national association mutilated and disabled by work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expresses his "great appreciation for the constant associative commitment to prevention in the workplace, the protection of injured workers, assistance to the families of the victims and the awareness of public opinion".
"It has been manifested, a 'enough', sincerely shared, in the face of tragedies that, by their dimensions, raise the clamor of the media and the participation of public opinion, instead the daily reality proposes dramatic cases, even repeated in their dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly a problem of resources: it is decisive to invest in training and information.
Particular significance is attached to the numerous initiatives promoted in schools for a more direct awareness on the part of young people entering the world of work.
It is a duty to keep alive the attention to the phenomenon, not to slow down the alarm about the social gravity, to apply and improve the legislative norms.
For his part, the President of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini has stressed "how the phenomenon of white deaths constitute an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each one of us and imposes on all institutions a determined effort to urgently put an end".
"The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not mean that the number of white deaths is equally impressive," said Anmil president Pietro Mercandelli.
Indeed, we do not want this “declining tendency” to translate into less attention, because it is precisely when attention decreases that tragedy exploits.
"We believe that on a general level too little is still done to contrast the phenomenon of accidents and the remedy can be exercised through multiple actions.
They are necessary, in our opinion - it has emphasized Mercandelli - greater controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the formation of the workers, and this from the world of the school".
"It serves a further effort - it has added - as far as it concerns the communication and the sensitization of the public opinion.
But above all, it serves a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers regarding a phenomenon that represents a social emergency.
Mercandelli has denounced "the progressive deterioration of the level of subsidiary protection provided for victims of work" and the "assistance diversion towards which the system is heading in recent years".
"The objective is to restore the worker's insurance guarantee - he added - so that the fate of those who are injured does not have to depend on the donation provided by the legislator each time."
MP3 Players Under Charge Put Hearing at Risk
Listening to loud music for a long period of time using portable music devices such as MP3 players can cause permanent hearing injuries.
This is what the European Commission refers to, which in a statement released in Brussels cites the opinion of the Scientific Commission of the emerging and newly identified health risk (Csrseri) of the EU, published today.
"From this scientific opinion emerges that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable musical devices weekly for more than an hour a day having the device at high volume risk a permanent loss of hearing ability."
“I am concerned that such a high number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and cell phones at a high acoustic level may unconsciously ruin their ears in an irremediable way,” Kuneva said.
“From the scientific evidence, a clear risk emerges and we must react quickly.
What counts is to sensitize consumers and make this information public.
We must also re-examine existing control systems in the light of this scientific opinion, so that they are broadly effective and keep pace with new technology."
Brussels had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, seeing the widespread use of portable musical devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise that this causes.
“Scientists confirm that this is cause for concern and the European Commission will now examine with Member States and stakeholders what measures could be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable music and related devices.”
Currently, there is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable musical devices to 100 dB, but concern is growing as hearing damage can result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to greatly limit these damages by resorting to solutions such as reducing levels and time of exposure to noise.
In its opinion, the EU Scientific Committee points out that users of portable musical devices listen to music at a high volume (more than 89 decibels) for only 5 hours a week exceeds the limit currently in force concerning the maximum noise allowed in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods, risk a permanent loss of hearing ability after a period of 5 years.
It means that it affects 5-10% of users of such devices and the number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno gives way to the Commission for the future of the capital
Today it begins, in March it closes, in June the accounts will be made.
This is the schedule set by the Municipality and for the workers of the "Commission for the future of the capital of Rome", which has been established this morning in its new headquarters behind the Baths of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will deliberate on the main points for Rome.
Once the doors are closed in March, the board and the communal council will evaluate analyses and projects, in order to present in June the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Municipality and its mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and is represented by all political, social and cultural ideas - Alemanno tends to emphasize - It must provide proposals for the development of Rome in which those who decide politically, the board and the municipal council, can then endorse.
There is no spare position of roles, only the will to have a place where to elaborate a great project for Rome.
In March finished the works will disappear, because this experience must have a precise temporal term.
In June - announces the mayor - we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of the capital of Rome".
To whom the Commission accuses of being useless, given that its opinions are not binding, Alemanno replies: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and on the quality of its proposals.
If quality will be present, as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am sure in Rome, its contribution will be fundamental.
Almost always the policy is crushed in the ordinary management and in emergencies that back to back manifest themselves.
We, on the contrary, want to look beyond and in the long term, in a deeper perspective, working seriously to the development of Rome and its future.
The mayor of Rome also tends to point out that "this Commission is neither a useless entity nor a banality: it is absolutely free, it does not cost a euro to Roman citizens and will serve to involve and reason the best minds that the capital squeezes".
For Alemanno, in fact, "it is necessary to have a strategic design as a reference, not closed or immobile, to allow our city to make an authentic level jump, of which we have absolute need, thinking with unitary spirit to its future".
A future that, the mayor of Rome specifies, "will not be limited only to the current communal boundaries but will look beyond" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as Capital but also "considering the role that Rome can and should develop as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama, the first anti-American president.
He has written a well-known American politician who is interested in going through as an independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions reduced the US economy and had relations (as he also does today gives private citizen) with the enemy Islam.
Attacks on Obama are on the rise as election day approaches.
A Miami woman wrote on a Web site: “This person is full of ambition.
Obama has a big stone face: he believes he will win the nation’s highest office that has ever had two governors and five black senators!”
In reality they are attacks that do not say much; they are clearly attacks of a racial nature and do not answer the question of the voters: will he be a good president? And there are also the polls; everyone says that Obama won and with a good advantage.
Also in this case there is someone who speaks with the heart but not with the brain.
A newspaper in Mississippi, in the bowels of the southern United States, has written an editorial: once in the booth to vote we will know well to whom the American patriot will give his vote.
Out comes one side of the American mentality covered to the last.
“Say what you want, we’ll figure out where to put the cross, whether it’s on Obama or McCain.”
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave America.
things never said before, which seems almost certain the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all these arguments, the winning weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
They have asked 1500 people: what were the mistakes made by Bush during his term? 89 percent have answered: Iraq.
It changes America.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was kicked in the ass.
In Iraq there are 4,500 soldiers who have lost their lives and the Americans have not been forced to pack their bags.
Similarly, Iraq for most has been Bush’s weak spot.
Whoever takes over from George W will have a huge duty to perform.
In the US, the economic collapse is also felt by journalists: in the newspapers it is time for cuts. Many blame the Internet, "killer" of printed paper.
Five hundred American journalists have been asked by PEW Research Center about the state of their profession and mind control for the future.
Today, however, most journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, journalists have not openly stated that they feel less concerned about credibility.
They don’t feel as isolated as they once did.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of a destroyed economic model.
In addition, the cuts made in the room where the editors work to make the newspaper, is a big problem.
It is a problem that must be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism as understood by the majority of the public is not to be substantially reduced.
A clear but complex pessimism prevails today over the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executives are convinced that journalism at the national level is following the wrong path.
In the local field the executive group is 65%.
Printed against emission.
It’s not hard for journalists to see where the web is going.
The biggest publishing houses are opening a gap in the Internet, for many seen as the "murderer" of the printed letter.
The “economic pressure” that journalists warn of has increased to 79 percent.
The 500 journalists interviewed have admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope “that it will do some good” for journalism.
The biggest rift in American journalism today is between those who run the newspapers—that is, the editors—and the journalists who work for them.
56% of executives at the national level are sure that their journalists share the same values, while at the local level the percentage drops to 23%.
For some this has to do with “job security.”
Executives who plan to lose their jobs in 3 years are 47% nationwide.
For journalistic staff it is 30%.
The "safe work" at the staff level (our editors, ed) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work on a contract.
In an immense nation like the United States, with 300 million inhabitants and millions of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and Internet, employers often offer what they want and it becomes a matter of “take it or leave it”.
Directors almost always receive good salaries, while editors can earn up to $10,000 a month, plus retirement and social insurance.
For the holidays, the reasoning becomes complicated: a total of days in the first year, another after the third to reach 15 full days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, by his admission, get “sick” all year long.
It's all about the weather.
UNIPOL: TRIBUNAL OF ROME, DANILO COPPOLA STAYS IN GROTTAFERRATA
The president of the second criminal section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the request of the real estate Danilo Coppola who had asked to be able to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a room in the city of Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy in the context of the investigation into the counter-covenant concerning the Unipol-Bnl escalation.
In the course of the arrest process under his charge, last week, he has obtained home release, turning it into a compulsory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate could travel the route from the city of the province to a room in the capital.
According to the court, these trips (for which the PM has voted against) would allow him to influence his society and access the evidence that accuses him.
Elites in Danger
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a few days ago with the vote of the House of Representatives against the $700 million rescue plan put in place by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and this, more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy.
The New York Times reports that the current crisis is disarming the Republican party, increasingly divided between its old soul of the East Coast, moderate, favorable to federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, instead, conservative, hostile to "those of Washington" and the world of finance, strong especially in the states of the Center and South.
The soul, in fact, has become overbearing with the vow of the one who spoke at the beginning.
This just mentioned is just one example of the mutations, of the great mutations, that the ongoing economic earthquake announces: not only in the United States but in the entire West and not only here alone.
Both in the United States and in Europe for some time now, the crisis seems to work as an accelerator of incubation phenomena that with the new climate solidify and come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the updating, the extraordinary reactivation, of the dual category state-sovereignty in relation to a type of nationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking-finance institutions which have, yes, strong financial relations with the outside, but above all the balance sheets of families living in a single country and in a single state are much more compromised.
The one that immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: that is, how to respond to the difficulty and protests of those people and families who, on the other hand, are voters.
The crisis appears economically global but is politically and exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems substantially out of the question or they don’t have much to say: the crucial test is the European Union which, as always, is divided between the different interests and the different state strategies.
It is from the government of each state that everyone expects an intervention, rescue and reactivation plans, new rules and above all the subsidy of funds: from the moment you reach the court it is only the state that possesses the economic resources and the mass of financial resources to remedy things.
And they also possess the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of incalculable value, values in certain circumstances in which no market and no organization will probably ever be able to dispose to the same extent.
This new emphasis that the crisis places on the nation-state is in perfect harmony, with the greatest importance whenever the new development of the economy tends to attribute it to a factor closely related to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered the network of ever more sophisticated technology, of the immaterial, while we were convinced that global finance was already destined to dominate the world, we realized that our future will instead have to deal more and more with non-immaterial things such as water, crops and oil.
All things that, look, can certainly be transported from one place to another of the earth but are equally absolutely united in a circumscribed space, a territory.
So whoever finds himself as sovereign, certainly possesses many more letters regarding who is not, and who has the misfortune to live in a post without crops, without oil and without water.
I come to the second novelty that but foreshadows a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics and Leadership.
In this sense, the economic crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, the objective awareness of the need for leadership, the request of someone who knows how to take the situation in hand.
On the other hand a wave of discredit for the existing leaderships, of inadequate relief economic species with many dark zones.
And together something deeper and in a certain sense disturbing: a discredit, an intolerance, an inadequate image, a sense of remoteness, which tends to involve the entire ruling class of the countries of the West in an increasing number.
It seems to be advancing more and more, in various places of the population, the conviction that before their actions are the same as those of the social elites until now booming, the same way of feeling and being, their culture in the comprehensive exception of the end, to have made their own time and to be more foreign to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership, in a nutshell, feeds underground a branched but powerful movement of delegitimization of the ruling classes and traditional political structures, which manifest themselves in an electoral “revolt” or in the sudden changes of collective moods of recent times, from the conservative exit in Austria-Bavaria to the collapse of the social-democratic consensus in Britain, to the rebellion of the men of the American congress against the Bush regime.
There is the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format would say some, always make it more difficult to understand and then to represent, what is taking shape today are the deep strata of Western society and that the economic crisis renews, increases and potentially agitates in excess.
In the face of all this talk of a “mass rebellion” today is frankly exaggerated.
But having your eyes open certainly isn’t.
The super glue to walk on the walls
Beat the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in the future walk on the walls like the spider man.
It is the target of several American research centers and now a team of four institutes has come quite close.
With an adhesive of only 2.5 square centimeters, scientists have been able to glue a body of 100 kilos on a vertical wall.
The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of researchers is an evolution of existing ones that use a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
“The glue principle can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged like a stack of spaghetti,” explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists were inspired by the legs of geckos, covered with microscopic hairs that can ensure the animal a perfect adhesion.
Tests done on different materials, such as glass, teflon and sandpaper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of this reptile and at the same time "it easily peels off the walls," explains Liming Dai, a researcher in the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
WALL WALKING? – “This material could be useful as a transient adhesive,” adds Liming Dai.
Layers to walk on the walls exactly like spider man? Layers yes, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electric current.
Other applications could have to do with aerospace engineering.
There are no superheroes at the moment.
Also the University of Berkeley, in California, is devoting itself to the search for a new adhesive.
In an article in the American Chemical Society magazine, Californian scholars have presented an adhesive made of microfibers like hairs that self-clean from dust during movement on a surface to always maintain perfect adhesion.
Drugs: never with fruit juice
Pay attention to grapefruit juice, orange juice and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed especially in summer because they are refreshing and rich in vitamins, if taken simultaneously with some drugs, their absorption is altered by amplifying or decreasing, depending on the case, the efficiency with serious consequences for health.
To repeat the risk of fruit juices being packaged that fresh associated with the assumption of some medicinal David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, who from the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society underway in Philadelphia sends a new alarm: just a glass of grapefruit, orange and apple juice to reduce the absorption of some drugs, nullifying the beneficial effects of the health and
Grapefruit juice had already been under accusation because it was held responsible for increasing to toxic levels some anti-arrhythmic medicinals, antibiotics, anxiolytics, antihistamines and neurological.
The same Italian agency of the drug had given the news in a bulletin of information two years ago alarming doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger that derived from this mixture and to pay attention to what you drink in the case you are assuming a drug such as Diasepam or Metadone.
According to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit drugs.
A long list of the active ingredients inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
Michele Carruba, director of the department of pharmacology at the State University of Milan, said: “These findings are generally pointed out to the various international and national drug agencies that eventually provide to change the information notes of the same.
That is why it is always necessary to read the illustrative leaflets of the medicines that are taken and if there is something that is not clear to us, do not let us be impressed, ask clearly to the doctor or to the pharmacist "said the expert of the agency Ansa.
The Economics Novel by Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics has been awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his studies, his models of trade and on the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a neo-Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is a noted New York Times columnist.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration’s decisions on the economy and foreign policy.
A few months after the attack of September 11, 2001, in those days that Enron was breaking, Krugman had predicted in an editorial published by the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences for the United States.
A forecast that triggered a lot of controversy and that for several years came reproached to the economy, but that has now been revealed to be accurate.
“I’m surprised and a little upset by how the memory of the Enron and Worldcom collapse scandal has quickly disappeared from public attention,” Krugman said in a statement.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the executive committee of the European central bank, Krugman is a “valued economist”, but also a disseminator with a style “very aggressive, particularly critical against the excesses of liberalism of the Bush administration”.
Open Office, echo the third edition of the package"anti-Microsoft<0xC2><0xBB>
OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source suite of personal productivity that aims to attract more and more users, from home to office to public administration professionals, as a free alternative to the well-known Microsoft Office.
After almost a year of work by volunteer developers, whose backs are monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the public with several novelties: to the welcome screen and to the less rude magazine interface, other more consistent ones are added, such as compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest ISO standard version.
Attention also to multi-functioning with the Office 2007 suite, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific functions of some modules such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of the PowerPoint presentation, useful for example, to send it via e-mail, or the possibility of importing the PDF file in the graphic elaboration module, preserving the original appearance of the page.
Always on this front you can create "hybrid PDF" documents, which accumulate the typical graphics of the Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or a word processor.
The Collaboration is an element that has received different improvements inside the applications: in the spreadsheet they can intervene in different users, avoiding the conflicts of the modifications, in the elaboration of texts, each collaborator is given a color in the comment for a better recognition in the revision phase.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice features to the Web (on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they should give the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and was added to the English version that was in the mirror from Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD can also be sent home or to work.
And if the theme of free can be a hook for dissemination in the houses, it is in the business field that Open Office the suite tests, tries the big bet, being able to already have several projects carried out in the public administration and in the schools.
And even the realities that offer an ideal training, consultation and assistance service for small and medium-sized companies, in which business prospects could be opened, are not lacking.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for video writing the corresponding Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that replaces Excel; Impress, for the presentation of Powerpoint; Dbase, as in the case of the well-known Access is the program that allows you to work in the data base; and finally Draw the graphic module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that until today we have already reached almost 3,600,000, with the release of the new version it is likely that the expected figure can be exceeded.
Kohl is also the fourth case of doping.
New positive case in the tour of France: it is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, of the Gerolsteiner team, third classified and winner of the best T-shirt of the climber.
The news is published on the website of the newspaper L'Equipe.
Kohl, 26, is the fourth third-generation EPO-positive rider, after Italians Riccardo Ricc<0xC3><0xB2> and Leonardo Piepoli and German Stefan Schumacher, also of Gerolsteiner.
Tests on Kohl’s blood samples are among those carried out in recent weeks in the labs of Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-tests confirm that it is positive, the Austrian will lose the third place to the Tour and anger against the two years of canonical disqualification.
Confirming the news of Kohl's positive doping to the third generation EPO is the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who has told the Associated Press that he has notified the Austrian authorities of the news.
The 26-year-old Austrian has positioned himself on the podium behind the Spaniard Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, winning the T-shirt of the best climber.
IMMIGRANTS: NEW YORK TIMES WONDER, IS ITALY RACIST?
Italy as a country of emigrants has only recently become a privileged destination for "immigrants welcomed with hostility.
Is this transforming the beautiful country into a nation of racists? This is what the New York Times asks itself in a long article that it has devoted to the debate on the subject of racism in Italy, starting from the case of the young Abdul William Guibre, originally from Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan for having stolen a box of biscuits.
This case evidences what the New York Times defines as the “northern paradox”: the northern regions are at the same time those where “more integration and more work” are registered but also the highest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the highest support in the Northern League.
As confirmed by the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the New York Times has also cited episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only that.
Also the new legislation wanted by the Lega tightens the brakes on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of illegal immigrants is cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
“Giorgio Napolitano, meeting Benedict XVI in Congress, has asked that the State and the Church work together to combat racism.”
Students victims of expensive rent, up to 900 euros for a room
The rental market for college students is not aware of the crisis.
According to the latest survey by the Sunia, the tenants’ union, renting a single room could cost a student 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"the phenomenon has already assumed very serious characteristics to the point of excluding the right to study a large part of young people for the very high costs that the family would have to sustain - explains the head of the studies office of the Sunia, Laura Mariani - in these cities the strong demand has totally deformed the market to the point of triggering a process of generalized increase even for the residents".
Apart from that in most cases the offers of rents contain a series of violations: free type contracts, unregistered, without limit of fee, sub-rents linked.
For Sunia extraordinary interventions are necessary that, through the revision of the tax, prices can be regulated.
Looking at the survey in detail, we see that in Milan, for a bed in Brianza area, they serve approximately 450 euros; for a single room from a minimum of 650 (Bande Nere area) to an average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera area) to a maximum of 900 (in Victoria area).
In Florence a bed costs on average 350/400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in areas near the University, they serve 250/280 euros for a bed in a double room and 370 to 500 for a single.
In Rome in the central areas near the University (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) they ask about 600 euros for a single room and 450 for a bed in a double room.
Only slightly lower values (550 euros for a single room) in areas near other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecitt<0xC3><0xA0>).
Economy is made only if you change peripheral area: 300 euros for a bed and 450 for a single room in Prenestina area, Centocelle and surroundings.
In Naples for a bed you are served 300/450 euros, for a room you spend from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the areas Polyclinic, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari for a bed you can get 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single one.
in the smaller cities the prices are lower in absolute terms, but it has a greater weight in the economy of the city.
In cities such as Perugia, where the phenomenon of renting to students and non-EU nationals is more frequent, there is a further anomaly: a 25/30% increase in the fee for foreign students compared to Italians.
Farewell to the old cinema Paradiso, the cities cancel the historic cinemas
The historical cinemas close favouring the Multiplex.
“A city without movie theaters in a blind city is like a face without eyes.”
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore effectively photographs what is happening in the big Italian urban centers and also in the provincial cities.
The process of marginalization of the cinemas, which with the birth of the great meticones in the periphery and the consequent disappearance of the mono rooms in the central areas of the city, is an inevitable and indisputable event with all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
To disappear almost always are historical places, full of memory, "it is as if a friend died, an acquaintance with whom a piece of place and so much emotion was shared", observes the director of the new Paradiso cinema, the film that twenty years ago won the cousin Oscar and the grand jury prize at Cannes, which told the poetry of a provincial cinema and the nostalgia for the way of living the cinema that lost so much.
The figures given by the Anec, the main association of merchants, speak for themselves: in the last five years 316 traditional cinemas have closed, and most of them are paid for by the cinemas of the main cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closures are first, Emilia-Romagna with 82 fewer cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
It is a demonstration that the advent of the multiplex is responsible for its disappearance, these three Italian regions have registered the largest number of new meticone cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany than in Emilia-Romagna.
“The Italian exercise has developed irrationally,” observes Paolo Protti, president of the Anec, “it would be useful if new structures were built but it would be necessary to guarantee the permanence of those already existing, because when a city hall closes, not all its patrons are willing to transfer to the meticons.
Not to mention the lack of funds in favor of merchants: the previous debt of the state is about 10 million euros.
It is shameful from the ethical and moral point of view that the government does not respect the laws that exist.
To sustain the sector would serve between 16 and 18 million euros per year.
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that worried about closures, decided to repair itself with the signing of a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy to promote and protect mono cinema both in the historic center and in the periphery.
Among the rules provided for there are tax facilitation measures in favor of managers and advantages for the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the limited traffic area and will have special rates for parking.
“It’s an initiative that I like,” observes Giuseppe Tornatore, “and I hope that other cities will follow Bologna’s example by putting other measures in place.
True, to contrast the extra power of the meticones, the traditional rooms have to improve the quality of the sound and the image because the public today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a subject that was always important to me: the closure of the Bagheria cinema, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make the "New Paradiso cinema", which I had already thought about for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass by the Rialto or the Quirinale of Via Nazionale already closed, where I have lived so many shared emotions, not to see the posters blackened by the dust, I turn to the other side.
Tie between politics and 'ndrangheta, the mayor of Gioia Tauro has been arrested
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to uniform the elections of the Municipality for those interested to the cosca Piromalli."
The charges that the magistrates of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria give to the intendant and vice intendant of Goia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and to the intendant of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning by mafia association, are heavy.
Also arrested was Gioacchino Piromalli, the elderly mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson lawyer, homonymous of the boss, already convicted of mafia criminal association and to compensate 10 million euros.
"Despising any legal and moral norms, and good sense," the prosecutors write, the two local administrations had expressed the will to pay consultations to lawyer Piromalli.
"The mafia family would have been allowed - the judges write - to officially enter the interior of the municipality facilitating the great possibility of control and command of the public administration."
The president of the Calabrian regional board Agazio Loiero does not hide that "agreements between the bad organized life there is a lot" in his region: "There are areas where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where the agreement is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'ndrangheta, heroes who keep themselves clean."
Those arrested this morning are added to those of last July after the police had announced the cutting of heads of the Piromalli mafia family.
Since the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, already in 1991 and always for alleged conditionings between organized crime and the local administration, the local politicians had been solvated of the charge of administering the municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the UDC at the time of the dissolution, after the runoff in May 2006, had been elected as head of a center-right coalition.
A scandal broke out when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
I call into question the deputy minister of the interior who at that time was Marco Minniti, accusing him of having organized everything for a political issue, but the judges in the arrest warrant signed this morning explain that Piromalli had even come to ask for the variation of the project of the A3 road.
From the environmental interceptions made to Dal Torrione, the judges write, emerges "the willingness to favor the demands of an entrepreneur, representative of a group very close to the Piromalli clan, uniforming the elections of the public administration on the interests of the mafia families".
When the energy is born from the waves, the big ones come down to the stage
It is an extinct field that occupies more than 70% of the surface of the planet and is now being discovered by the world’s largest energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources on which the great like Chevron look.
The possibility of collecting energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for a hundred years and in the 70s together with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil fell in 1980, the idea of harnessing marine energy was put aside, but now that environmental cases and the new increase in oil are giving impetus to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London has estimated for 2007 that 15 percent of the world's electricity need could be covered by implants that exploit the movement of the waves of the sea.
This amount would be double that currently produced by nuclear power plants.
And then there would be the currents and the tides.
Giants on the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy has been Enersis, which in 2005 has sealed an agreement to build an implant in the North of Portugal.
When the intention was announced, it seemed like a revolutionary step.
Two years away to bet on marine energy are always more and among these companies those who have always voted for traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying ocean energy technology," a spokesman for a company associated with the U.S. oil giant told the Wall Street Journal, "and is evaluating the possibility of cooperating with us."
The cooperation in question is about obtaining a permit from the U.S. Energy Commission, to carry out a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
It’s a pretty important sign, considering that in Alaska the U.S. continues to extract oil and recently President Bush has activated a plan to carry out new drilling.
In addition to Chevron is Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey to follow the path of energy coming from the sea, the total invested so far, although not detailed indicate an increasing interest.
technology to develop.
Experts speak of a technology still at the beginning, because marine energy there is no doubt that it has a great environmental impact.
For now the impacts like those of the Portuguese or the Scots are small and do not seem to create major problems for the ecosystem.
To produce energy on a large scale, a technology with a greater environmental impact must be used.
And the options are several: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of boas joined together.
The force of the waves, which makes the boas move up and down becomes hydraulic pressure with pistons and cylinders inside them.
The pressure spins a turbine which in turn feeds a generator.
Electricity is sent to the coast via submarine cables.
For now there are four implants of this type in development, waiting only for federal approval, apart from energy, could serve for a military installation.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces power for a shopping center and a parking lot, using underwater turbines in the East River of New York.
The movement of the water when there are tides, makes the blades of the turbines rotate, creating a rotary movement that feeds the generator.
Verdant has said it has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to use the energy.
After the waves, the tides.
Of particular interest, they say at the Institute for the Development of Electric Power, right now deserves the potential of the tides.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, tides are more preventable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is mostly about tidal energy that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others approaching the coasts, have invested 7.5 million dollars in 2008 and an investment of 35 million is planned for 2009.
