Accumulated incidence of rapidly increasing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union or the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) demonstrates similar trends in the countries of the European Union or the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, confirming that, although at different stages depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is advancing rapidly in all countries.
Based on Italy’s experience, countries, hospitals and intensive care units need to improve their preparedness for a wave of COVID-19 patients who will require medical care and, in particular, intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the causative agent was a novel coronavirus that is now known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2 has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date indicates that 80% of people with COVID-19 have a mild illness, i.e., a respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, and that the majority recover.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 evolves into a more serious illness requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% of cases develop a critical illness requiring intensive care.
Mortality in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we examined trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each country of the European Union or the European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compared them with those in Hubei Province, China.
We also compared the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK with that in Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, COVID-19 continued to spread geographically and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world currently follow that of this country.
On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic.
In the March 5 edition of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported on the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe according to the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were registered in France on 24 January 2020, in people who had returned from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases had been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), according to which between 31 December 2019 and that date inclusive, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths had been recorded, of which 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths had occurred in Italy alone.
Obtaining the cumulative amount and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), COVID-19 case counts reported in every country in the world, obtained only from official sources, such as the countries’ Ministry of Health, national and regional health authorities and WHO, are updated daily at 8:00 a.m.
These data were used to examine COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK and to compare them with that in Italy.
As an indicator of the prevalence of active cases of COVID-19, we calculated the cumulative incidence of cases of COVID-19 truncated to 14 days; thus, we took into account the natural course of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA country and the UK, during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also present the cumulative number of cases reported in each country as of March 15, 2020, at 8:00 a.m., compared to that of Italy for the period from January 31 to March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and the UK
Trends in the cumulative incidence of 14-day truncated COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK generally followed that of Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
In the EU/EEA and the UK in general, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 started to increase around 21 February and then increased considerably around 28 February 2020 (complementary material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK exhibited similar upward trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (complementary material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK, compared to Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
As of 8 a.m. on 15 March, another 15 EU/EEA countries and the UK had already registered a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy only 3 weeks or less earlier.
Our results indicate that the number of reported COVID-19 cases is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The observed trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is progressing at a similar pace in all countries.
This is despite different stages in countries, variations in national public health responses, and possibly different definitions of case in countries and different protocols for selecting patients to be tested to confirm COVID-19, including delayed testing.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy described a situation in which 10% of COVID-19 patients required intensive care, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on admissions of COVID-19 cases in a hospital or intensive care unit are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data not shown).
However, they should be systematically collected to complement current surveillance data that focus on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study conducted in 2010–11 showed a wide variation in the availability of intensive and intermediate care beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 inhabitants in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or fewer resources than Italy (12.5 intensive and intermediate care beds per 100,000 inhabitants in 2010–11).
Model scenarios in relation to the saturation of health care capacity, with calculations for each EU/EEA country and the UK of the prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalization cases associated with a >90% risk of overcapacity of intensive care beds, are provided in the sixth update of the ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment on COVID-19.
Since case clusters have so far been formed in certain regions of EU/EEA countries and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units normally serve a defined regional catchment population, information on cases and intensive care beds should preferably be made available at the level of the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
The experience of Italy and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is advancing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units, therefore, must prepare for a scenario of sustained community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients requiring medical care and, in particular, intensive care, such as is occurring in the affected regions of Italy.
As indicated in the ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment, it is essential to take a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach to delaying the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a shift from a containment approach to a mitigation one, given that the anticipated rapid increase in the number of cases may not give decision makers and hospitals sufficient time to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly if not implemented in advance.
The rapid risk assessment also lists the public health measures needed to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a brief window of opportunity during which countries have the possibility to deepen their control efforts to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on the health system.
If this is not done, health systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to face a wave of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days and weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 in China and other parts of the world, creating a catastrophe for humans.
Similar to its virus counterpart, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could also be transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality than SARS, but it is much more transmissible and affects older people more than young people and men more than women.
In response to the growing number of publications on the emerging disease, the purpose of this article is to provide a timely and comprehensive analysis of the rapidly developing research topic.
We will deal with the basic aspects of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of the disease.
While many questions remain unanswered, we hope this analysis will help to understand and eradicate this menacing disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 has become an unheard of and indelible memory for all Chinese, who were urged to stay at home throughout the holiday and for several more weeks due to the outbreak of a new viral disease.
The virus has almost the same name as the coronavirus (CoV) that caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, on February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) called it SARS-CoV-2, and the associated disease was called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China and quickly spread across the country and to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus has caused more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients discharged and more than 3,000 patients deceased.
The WHO warns that COVID-19 is the “public enemy number 1” and that it is potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 scientific papers have been published on COVID-19, including its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on January 7, 2020, which determined the sequence of the virus isolated from multiple patients.
The objective of this analysis is to summarize the advances in research on this new subject that is developing rapidly.
When possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another disease caused by a CoV, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, an outbreak in 2012).
We will also examine what is known so far about the prevention and prognosis of the disease, as well as some decisive questions that have not yet been answered.
Coronaviruses have traditionally been considered non-lethal pathogens for humans, mainly causing about 15% of common colds.
However, in this century, we have twice encountered highly pathogenic coronaviruses in humans, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused an outbreak originally in China, in 2003, and in Saudi Arabia, in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other countries with appalling morbidity and mortality.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 outbreak is the third coronavirus outbreak on record in human history.
As shown in Fig. 1.1, pneumonia clusters of unknown origin were first reported on December 31, 2019 from Wuhan to the National Health Commission of China.
Seven days later, the sequence of the coronavirus was reported.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatal case was recorded in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic quickly spread to cities, provinces and neighboring countries.
On January 20, infection was reported from health care providers, which suggested that human-to-human transmission was possible.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was quarantined and all public transport was suspended.
On January 24, the first clinical study on the disease reported that, of the 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 had had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market that was considered the site of origin of infection from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
As of the date of this report, the disease has already spread throughout China and almost 50 other countries around the world (fig. 2).
As the situation evolves rapidly, the final size and severity of the outbreak cannot yet be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multicentre study of 8866 patients, including 4021 patients with confirmed COVID-19, presented a more up-to-date illustration of the epidemic described below (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but mainly people aged 30 to 65.
Almost half (47.7%) of infected people were over 50 years old, very few were under 20 and only 14 infected people were under 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 expanded into clusters mostly in and around Hubei.
On average, 5 days (2 to 9) elapsed between the onset and diagnosis of COVID-19.
The average incubation period was 4.8 days (between 3.0 and 7.2).
The average time from onset to death was 9.5 days (between 4.8 and 13).
The basic reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of people infected increased exponentially before January 23, 2020, coinciding with the time of mass mobilization prior to the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and the adjusted mortality of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were sex (male), age (<0xE2><0x89><0xA5>60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large, enveloped viruses that contain one-way strand RNA.
They can be divided into four genera, namely alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which the alphacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus are those that infect humans.
The envelope spike (S) glycoprotein binds to its cellular receptors, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and then membrane fusi<0xC3><0xB3>n occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA, along with envelope glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins, forms vesicles containing virions, which then fuse with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was announced on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new type of betacoronavirus with a genetic identity of more than 99.98% in 10 sequenced samples taken from the original site of the outbreak: Wuhan’s Huanan Seafood Market.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.
Using a transmission electron microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in ultrathin sections of the human respiratory epithelium.
Human ACE2 was determined to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds to human ACE2 more weakly than SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a novel short protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b could have a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit IFN<0xCE><0xB2> expression; however, orf8 does not contain any known domain or functional motif.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., revealed the electron cryomicroscopy structure of full-length human ACE2 at 2.9 <0xC3><0x85> resolution, in complex with the transport amino acid B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, assembled as a dimer, and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind two S proteins, providing evidence for recognition and infection of the coronavirus.
B0AT1 could become a therapeutic target for the study of drugs to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The origin and the intermediate host
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to have originated in bats and were transmitted to humans via civets and camels, respectively.
In a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, the bat was considered to be the native host of SARS-CoV-2, as the new virus is 96% identical to two bat-like coronaviruses called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, it is still unknown which intermediate host helped the virus cross the species barrier to infect humans, and it remains to elucidate the transmission route.
Ji, et al., proposed snakes as carriers of bat virus to humans, implying homologous recombination within the S protein.
According to a study, researchers from Guangzhou, China, suggested that pangolins (long-snouted mammals that feed on ants and are often used in traditional Chinese medicine) are a possible intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 based on a 99% genetic homology in a coronavirus discovered in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a 1% difference propagated by the entirety of two genomes remains a large difference; therefore, conclusive results providing concrete evidence are awaited (fig. 33).
The physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still largely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at less than 20 °C with a humidity of 40-50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be sensitive to ultraviolet rays and heat at 56°C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, a chlorine disinfectant, perchloric acid, chloroform and other fat solvents, but not chlorhexidine, are effective in deactivating the virus.
The entire human population in general lacks immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and, therefore, is susceptible to the novel coronavirus.
So far, no detailed studies on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 have been announced.
Consequently, we can only resort to previous studies with other coronaviruses, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (fig. 4).
In general, after the virus invades the host, it is first recognized by the host's innate immune system through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including C-type lectin receptors, Toll-type receptors (TLRs), NOD-type receptors (NLRs), and RIG-I-type receptors (RLRs).
Through different pathways, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFN) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, the SARS-CoV N protein can help the virus escape immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response adds to the fight against the virus.
T cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce antibodies specific for the virus, and CD8+ T cells directly kill cells infected with the virus.
The helper T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to help the defending cells.
However, coronaviruses can inhibit T cell functions by inducing T cell apoptosis.
Humoral immunity, which includes complements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, is also essential for fighting viral infection.
For example, antibodies isolated from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an overreaction of the immune system locally generates a large amount of free radicals that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst case, multi-organ failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by clustering, is more likely to affect older people with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is common for people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised to be more likely to become infected than others.
The estimated mean incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1 to 14 days, mostly 3 to 7 days, according to a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1099 cases shows that the incubation period was 3 days on average and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, demonstrates that the incubation period was 4.8 days (between 3.0 and 7.2) based on the demographics of 8866 cases.
It is very important that health authorities adapt the effective quarantine time according to the most accurate incubation period; it is in this way that asymptomatic infected persons will be prevented from transmitting the virus to others.
As usual practice, people exposed to the virus or infected should normally be quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever is usually the main and initial symptom of COVID-19, which may be accompanied by no other symptoms or by other symptoms such as dry cough, dyspnoea, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients had dyspnoea or hypoxemia one week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients progressed rapidly to acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever or respiratory symptoms and acute fever, even without pulmonary abnormalities in imaging studies, should be tested for the virus for early diagnosis.
A demographic study from late December 2019 indicated that symptom rates were 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnea, and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients required respiratory assistance.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies of a family conglomerate and a conglomerate caused by the transmission of an asymptomatic person.
Comparably, a 2012 demographic study showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and dyspnoea (55%) as their main symptoms.
However, 80% of them required respiratory assistance, much more than COVID-19 patients and in line with the increased lethality of MERS with respect to COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnoea (40%-42%), diarrhoea (20%-25%) and sore throat (13%-25%) were shown to be the main symptoms and respiratory assistance was needed in approximately 14% to 20% of patients.
As of 14 February, COVID-19 mortality was 2% when confirmed cases reached 66,576 worldwide.
Similarly, SARS mortality for November 2002 was 10% in 8096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, according to a June 2012 demographic study, mortality was 37% in 2,494 confirmed cases.
In a previous study, the SARS-CoV-2 R0 was reported to be high and elevated to 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71 to 7.23, while the SARS-CoV R0 only ranged from 2 to 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV for symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The above figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher propagation capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but its lethality is lower than the latter two.
Therefore, it is much more difficult to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The appearance in conglomerates usually occurs within the same family or from the same meeting or vehicle, such as a cruise.
Patients usually have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan and other affected areas or contact with infected persons or patients within two weeks of onset.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and that patients discharged from the hospital can contract the virus again, an alarm signal that the quarantine time should be increased.
Patients have a normal or reduced amount of peripheral blood white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in the early stage.
For example, lymphopenia was observed with a white blood cell count of <0x3C>4<0xC3><0x97>109/L, including a lymphocyte count of <0x3C>1<0xC3><0x97>109/L, and elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase in 1099 patients with COVID-19.
Liver and muscle enzyme levels and myoglobin were elevated in the blood of some patients, and C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation were elevated in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the level of D-dimer, a product of fibrin degradation present in the blood, was elevated, and lymphocyte count was progressively reduced.
Abnormalities in the chest x-rays of most COVID-19 patients are detected, characterized by bilateral frosted glass shadows or opacities in the lungs.
Patients usually develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation, and progressive fibrosis severely affect gas exchange.
Dysfunction of type I and type II pneumocytes decreases the level of surfactant and increases surface tension, which reduces the ability of the lungs to expand and increases the risk of pulmonary collapse.
Consequently, the worst findings on chest X-rays are often in parallel with the maximum severity of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathologic analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the desquamation of pneumocytes, the formation of a hyaline membrane and infiltration of lymphocytes in the interstitium, and multinucleated syncytial cells in the lungs of a patient who died from the disease, which is coincident with the pathology of a viral and ARDS infection, and similar to that of patients with SARS.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which could accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which was no longer based solely on RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation also occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiological findings is essential and imperative for effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol for using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic fragments of SARS-CoV-2 RNA at between 20 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 mol/L and 200 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter of sample) using a graduated rod not less than one.
Hopefully, the new technique can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience if tested in clinical samples.
Because of the lack of experience with the new coronavirus, physicians can mostly provide supportive care to COVID-19 patients, while testing with a variety of therapies that have been used or proposed before for the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include currently or potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
It was even proposed to use plasma from recovered patients for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies compete to see who develops antibodies and vaccines against the virus first.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at first and probably also attacks, to a lesser degree, other organs that express ACE2, such as those of the digestive system and the kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and insufficiency are the greatest threat to patients and the leading cause of death.
Accordingly, respiratory assistance is critical to alleviating symptoms and saving lives, and includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation according to the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) assistance, a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique used to treat life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining electrolyte balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and septic shock, and protecting vital organ functions are also essential in patients with SARS-CoV-2.
Cytokine storm is known to result from an overreaction of the immune system in patients with SARS and MERS.
Cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a number of cytokines, including TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-2, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB3>, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a huge amount of free radicals that are the main cause of ARDS and multi-organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential for the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 receptor monoclonal antibody, have been used to treat the cytokine storm.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine storm are modulation of the T-cell-directed immune response; blockade of IFN-<0xCE><0xB3>, IL-1 and TNF; inhibition of JAK; blinatumomab; a suppressor of cytokine signaling pathway 4, and inhibitors of HDAC.
Steroids, such as immunosuppressants, were widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high-dose steroids were not beneficial for severe lung injuries in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
Instead, they can cause serious side effects, in particular osteonecrosis, which affects the prognosis remarkably.
However, the prudent use of low to moderate doses of corticosteroids for a short period has been recommended for patients with COVID-19 in critical condition.
As of the date of this analysis, the efficacy of any antiviral therapy has not been confirmed.
However, the efficacy of remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, administered intravenously in an American patient with COVID-19 has been tested.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug initially developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by the Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, remdesivir also demonstrated the potential to inhibit other single-stranded RNA viruses, such as MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on these, Gilead has provided the compound to China to conduct a couple of trials on people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and there is great expectation for the results.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon alfa, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been suggested as possible therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur following combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other drugs used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma from recovered patients and generation of antibodies
Drawing blood from patients who have recovered from a contagious disease to treat other patients who have contracted the same disease or to protect healthy people from contracting the disease is not new.
In fact, recovered patients typically have a relatively high level of antibodies to the pathogen in their blood.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B cells to fight pathogens and other foreign objects, and they recognize certain molecules in pathogens and neutralize them directly.
On this basis, plasma was drawn from the blood of a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 and 10 seriously ill patients were injected.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, accompanied by reduced inflammation and viral loads and improved blood oxygen saturation.
However, it is necessary to verify and clarify this in order to propose the method for large-scale use until specific therapies are developed.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some disadvantages associated with plasma should be considered carefully.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, possibly resulting in deadly toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is normally low, and the demand for plasma is high to treat critically ill patients.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to fight a global pandemic.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from recovered patients and identify genetic codes encoding effective antibodies or to search for effective antibodies against the essential proteins of the virus.
In this way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
MCT has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases in China.
However, its effects depend largely on a combination of several components in a formula that varies according to the diagnosis of a disease according to the theories of MCT.
Most effective components remain unknown or imprecise, as it is difficult to extract and verify such components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of an effective and specific therapy for COVID-19, MCT has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for those who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, it was determined that Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules are effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
The main recovery rates in the treatment of COVID-19 patients were observed in several provinces in China that used MCT in 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei province, which used MCT in only about 30% of its COVID-19 patients, had the lowest recovery rate (13%).
However, this is a fairly rough comparison, as many other impact factors, such as the number and severity of patients, should be included in the assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing western medicine (MO) treatment alone with combined MO and MCT treatment.
They found that the times required for body temperature recovery, symptom disappearance and hospitalization were markedly shorter in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group alone.
More surprisingly, the rate of symptom worsening (mild to severe) was markedly lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO alone group (7.4% vs. 46.2%), and mortality was lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO alone group (8.8% vs. 39%).
However, the efficacy and safety of MCT are still awaiting further well-controlled trials at larger scales and at more sites.
It would also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of actions and determine the effective components of TCM treatments or their combinations if possible.
Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 are usually very afraid of the highly contagious and even deadly disease, and people in quarantine also experience boredom, loneliness and anger.
In addition, symptoms of the infection such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatments, such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, can cause more anxiety and mental distress.
In the early phase of the SARS outbreak, a number of psychiatric morbidities were reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor arousal, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicidal tendencies.
Mandatory contact tracing and quarantine, as part of public health responses to the COVID-19 outbreak, can make people feel more nervous and guilty about the effects of contagion, quarantine and stigma on their family and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, persons with suspicion and persons in contact with them, as well as to the general public in need.
Psychological support should include the formation of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communications with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatment plans, and the use of electronic devices and professional applications to avoid close contact between people.
Effective vaccines are essential to interrupt the chain of transmission of infected animal and human reservoirs to susceptible hosts, and often complement antiviral treatment in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop protein S-based vaccines to generate potent and long-lasting neutralizing antibodies or immunity that protect against SARS-CoV.
Live attenuated virus vaccines have been evaluated in animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these potential vaccines in older people and models of lethal stimulation and their protection against zoonotic virus infection should still be determined before a clinical study is initiated.
This is likely because SARS became extinct 17 years ago and no new cases have been recorded since.
Instead, cases and clusters of MERS remain sporadically in the Middle East that spread to other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies for MERS have been developed using deactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for non-immune people is an urgent and decisive task to control the ongoing pandemic.
However, it is difficult to overcome the difficulties due to the long period (18 months on average) necessary for the development of a vaccine and the dynamic variations of coronaviruses.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has only just begun to manifest its full clinical course in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can gradually recover without sequelae.
However, as with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, creating a prognosis model for the disease is essential for health agencies to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor for the prognosis of SARS, which is also correct for COVID-19.
COVID-19 occurred mostly in people aged 30 to 65 and 47.7% of those patients were over 50 in a study of 8866 cases, as described above.
Patients who required intensive care were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications and were considerably older than those who did not (mean age 66 vs. 51), suggesting that age is a prognostic factor in the progression of COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 vs. 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: COVID-19 patients who require intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart injury and arrhythmia.
Cardiac events were also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which can lead to liver dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
Age and underlying diseases are strongly correlated and can interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and has been proposed as a possible prognostic factor for disease, response to therapy, and final recovery.
The correlation between the level of CRP and the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 has also been proposed.
In addition, an elevated level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict patient evolution.
These enzymes are expressed intensely in various organs, especially the heart and liver, and are released when tissue is damaged.
Therefore, they are traditional markers of cardiac or hepatic dysfunctions.
Major clinical symptoms: Chest X-ray and temporal progression of clinical symptoms should be considered in conjunction with other symptoms for predicting clinical outcomes and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants that are commonly used as adjuvant therapy for infectious diseases in order to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since the use of high doses of corticosteroids was widespread in patients with severe SARS, many survivors developed avascular osteonecrosis with permanent disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used in low doses and for a short period in patients with COVID-19.
Mental stress: As described above, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients have suffered extraordinary stress, as they generally endured long periods of quarantine and extreme uncertainty, and witnessed the deaths of close family members and other patients.
It is essential to provide psychotherapy and long-term support to these patients to help them recover from stress and return to their normal lives.
According to demographic studies conducted so far, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics than SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can replicate efficiently in the upper respiratory tract and causes mild symptoms or does not cause symptoms in the early stage of infection, as with other coronaviruses that cause common colds.
Therefore, infected patients in the early stage or in the incubation period can produce a large number of viruses during their daily activities, which greatly hinders the control of the epidemic.
However, transmission of SARS-CoV was considered to occur when patients were severely ill, whereas transmission mostly did not occur in the early phase.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 outbreak is much more serious and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
Great efforts are being made right now in China, including the closure of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the continued quarantine of almost the entire population in hopes of disrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures have been causing significant damage to the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing, indicating the slowdown of the epidemic.
According to the most optimistic forecast, the outbreak will have concluded by March and the downward phase will last 3 or 4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimated that COVID-19, which appears to be considerably more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., created a model to predict the evolution of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world’s population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in both nasal and pharyngeal exudates in patients who had recovered and left the hospital 2 weeks earlier, indicating that the newly identified virus could develop into an influenza-like cyclic episode.
However, promising signs have been seen in China given the decline in the number of new cases, indicating that current strategies may be working.
Originally it was predicted that Ebola would cause up to a million cases with half a million deaths.
However, through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease has been successfully controlled.
It is possible that, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 weakens in terms of infectivity and eventually becomes extinct or becomes a less pathogenic virus that coexists with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with that of SARS and MERS is given below (fig. (fig. 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible through coughing or sneezing, and possibly also through direct contact with materials contaminated with the virus.
The virus was also detected in feces, raising a new possibility of fecal-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases were possibly caused by infections in healthcare settings, including 17 patients with other prior illnesses and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, precautions should be taken to protect humans, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues, and even passers-by in contact with infected patients or persons.
The first line of defense that could be used to decrease the risk of infection is the use of masks; the use of surgical masks and masks with N95 respirator (serial number 1860) helps control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent droplets of fluid from a potentially infected person from being transmitted through the air or adhering to surfaces, from where they could be transmitted to other people.
However, only N95 masks (serial number 1860) can protect against inhalation of virions as small as 10 to 80 nm, and only 5% of virions can penetrate them completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size and both measure around 85 nm.
Since particles can penetrate up to five stacked surgical masks, healthcare providers in direct contact with patients should use N95 masks (serial number 1860) and not surgical masks.
In addition to face masks, health care providers should wear tailored isolation gowns in order to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor became infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing an N95 mask; it is possible that the virus has entered your body through your inflamed eyes.
Therefore, health care providers should also wear protective masks or clear glasses while working with patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is strongly suggested that people wash their hands with disinfectant soaps more often than usual, try to stay home in voluntary quarantine, and limit contact with people who may be infected.
Three feet is considered an adequate distance for people to stay away from a patient.
These measures are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 appeared as a new virus to the human world, its high homology to SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, should have caused high alert in China for its experience with the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, it was not until January 19, 2020 that the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control reassured citizens that the new virus had low contagiousness and limited reproductive capacity among humans, and that there would be no problems to prevent and contain the disease.
This message significantly eased public alarm, especially at a time when the entire country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical moment to contain the disease on a minimal scale in Wuhan was missed.
China’s disease control agencies should learn from this hard lesson and adopt decisive improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should be (1) more cautious when making public announcements, as each word matters to citizens and may cause them to change their attitude or their decisions; (2) more responsive and reactive to unusual information from clinics, rather than waiting for formal reports from doctors or officials; (3) more responsively tailored to contain a possible epidemic in its early stages, rather than trying to reassure the public; and (4) more regular and accurate implementation of epicrosis.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread across China and some 50 other countries around the world at the time of this analysis.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and there are also many similarities between the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak has generated the feeling of SARS reappearance.
However, there are some noticeable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential to contain the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and men more than women, and severity and mortality are also higher in older people than in young people.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% vs. 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 transmit the virus even though they do not have symptoms, while patients with SARS usually do so when they are seriously ill, which generates a much greater difficulty in containing the spread of COVID-19 compared to SARS.
This explains, in part, why SARS-CoV-2 spread much faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2 can be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, cured patients can test positive for the virus again.
These results dramatically increase the risk of the virus spreading.
Given the rapid progress in COVID-19 research, several important issues remain to be resolved, including:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% genetic homology was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two bat coronaviruses similar to SARS, it is not yet possible to conclude that SARS-CoV-2 comes from bats.
What animal was the intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original host, say, bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to numbers 1 and 2, it is not possible to stop the transmission efficiently, and the outbreak can resurface at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical testing have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter airway cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to cells that express ACE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is not possible to achieve a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically while it is transmitted between humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, go extinct like SARS, or resurface periodically like the flu?
Although it may take some time, it is essential to look for answers to these questions and many others.
However, whatever the cost, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to our normal lives.
Zoonotic Origins of Human Coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have driven the coevolution of coronaviruses and their hosts, including humans, for thousands of years.
Until 2003, two human coronaviruses were known to cause mild illnesses, such as the common cold.
Outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have flipped the coin by revealing how devastating and deadly a human coronavirus infection can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 put coronaviruses in the spotlight again and surprised us with high transmissibility and reduced pathogenicity compared to its sibling, SARS-CoV.
Human coronavirus infection is a zoonosis and it would be useful to know the zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses.
Most human coronaviruses have their origin in bats, in which they are not pathogens.
Intermediate reservoir hosts of some human coronaviruses are also known.
Identifying animal hosts has direct implications for disease prevention in humans.
Investigating the interactions between coronaviruses and hosts in animals could also yield important information on the pathogenesis of coronaviruses in humans.
In this analysis, we present an overview of the existing knowledge about the seven human coronaviruses, with emphasis on the history of their discovery, as well as their zoonotic origins and interspecies transmission.
Notably, we compare and contrast the different coronaviruses of humans from the perspective of virus evolution and genome recombination.
The current coronavirus disease epidemic 2019 (COVID-19) is analyzed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for successful host changes and the implications of virus evolution on disease severity are also highlighted.
Coronaviruses belong to the family Coronaviridae, which comprises a group of enveloped positive single-stranded RNA viruses.
These viruses, which harbor the largest genome, from 26 to 32 kilobases, among RNA viruses, were called "coronaviruses" because of their morphology, because of the corona shape they have under an electron microscope.
As for their structure, coronaviruses have unsegmented genomes that share a similar organization.
Approximately two-thirds of the genome contains two large open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which translate into the replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab.
The polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 non-structural proteins, referred to as nsp1<0xE2><0x88><0xBC>16.
The remaining part of the genome contains ORF for structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleoprotein (N).
A number of lineage-specific accessory proteins are also encoded by different coronavirus lineages.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, coronaviruses are classified into four genera (alphacoronavirus, betacoronavirus, gammacoronavirus, and deltacoronavirus), among which the betacoronavirus genus contains the majority of human coronaviruses and is subdivided into four lineages (A, B, C, and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents are the source of genes for most alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses, while birds are the main reservoir for gammacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses.
For thousands of years, coronaviruses have constantly crossed species barriers and some have emerged as important human pathogens.
To date, seven human coronaviruses are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alphacoronaviruses.
The other five betacoronaviruses are HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 typically cause mild symptoms, such as a common cold or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic and cause severe lower respiratory tract infection in a relatively larger number of patients, with a higher likelihood of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from the nasal secretion of patients with a common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has accumulated through extensive studies of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, until the SARS outbreak, it was a widely accepted concept that human coronavirus infection is generally harmless.
The SARS outbreak that occurred in 2003 is one of the most devastating in current history and infected more than 8,000 people, with a crude lethality of around 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak resulted in a persistent epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic spread to the rest of the world.
The new human coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), which was later named SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic, which has claimed more than 3120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm has been sounding and the world must prepare for the coming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
The seven human coronaviruses have a zoonotic origin in bats, mice or domestic animals.
Several lines of evidence support the evolutionary origin of all human coronaviruses in bats, in which the viruses are well-adapted and non-pathogenic, but exhibit great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has posed enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges in China and the rest of the world.
Tracing the zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving force, and constraining factors of the interspecies jump.
This could also guide or facilitate the search for the reservoir and intermediate animal hosts and enhancers of SARS-CoV-2, which would have important implications in preventing spread in the future.
In this analysis, we present an overview of the zoonotic origins, interspecies transmission and pathogenesis of human coronaviruses.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the common theme that human coronavirus parental viruses are not normally pathogenic in their natural reservoir hosts, but become pathogenic upon interspecies transmission to a new host.
We also examined the trend of evolution of human coronaviruses, in which increased transmissibility often leads to decreased pathogenicity.
The evolution of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is also analyzed in this context.
Animal coronaviruses have been known since the late 1930s.
Before HCoV-229E strain B814 was first isolated from the nasal secretion of patients who had contracted a common cold, different coronaviruses had been isolated in different infected animals, such as turkey, mouse, cow, pig, cat, and dog.
In recent decades, seven human coronaviruses have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of human coronavirus discoveries in chronological order (Table 1) would be informative and instructive.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated from the airways of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966 and subsequently adapted to grow in WI-38 lung cell lines.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E had symptoms of the common cold, such as headache, sneezing, malaise and sore throat, with fever and cough in 10<0x7E>20% of cases.
Later, in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and subsequent serial passage in the brains of lactating mice.
The clinical features of HCoV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, whose symptoms are identical to those of infections with other respiratory pathogens, such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed throughout the world and tend to be transmitted predominantly during the winter season, in temperate climates.
In general, the incubation time of these two viruses is less than one week, followed by a disease period of about 2 weeks.
According to a study with human volunteers, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E developed a mild common cold.
Only a few immunocompromised patients had severe lower respiratory tract infection.
SARS, also known as “atypical pneumonia,” caused the first pandemic caused by a well-documented human coronavirus in human history, and the etiological agent is SARS-CoV, the third human coronavirus to be discovered.
The first case of SARS dates back to late 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8096 reported cases with 774 deaths and spread across many countries and continents.
Apart from the superpropagators, it was calculated that each case could cause approximately two secondary cases, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and the appearance of the maximum viral load on the tenth day of disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially present with myalgia, headache, fever, malaise and chills, followed by dyspnoea, cough and difficulty breathing as late symptoms.
Lymphopenia, impaired liver function, and elevated creatine kinase are common abnormal results in laboratory tests for SARS.
Diffuse alveolar damage, epithelial cell proliferation and an increase in macrophages are also observed in patients with SARS.
Approximately 20-30% of patients subsequently require intensive care and mechanical respiratory assistance.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney, can also become infected in these severe cases, usually accompanied by a cytokine storm, which could be fatal, particularly in immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first isolated from the open-pit lung biopsy of a relative of the initial patient who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, enormous efforts have been devoted to the research of human coronaviruses.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands in late 2004.
Initially, it was determined to be prevalent in young children, older adults, and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
The presentation of coryza, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis is common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from a nasal sample taken from an 8-month-old boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was identified in the Netherlands, it is actually distributed around the world.
HCoV-NL63 has been estimated to cause approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, with peak incidence occurring in early summer, spring, and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 was reported to be associated with acute asthma exacerbations.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 was found worldwide and caused mild respiratory disease.
These four community-acquired human coronaviruses have adapted well to humans and, in general, are less likely to mutate to cause highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents did occur from unknown causes, such as in the rare case of a more virulent subtype of HCoV-NL63, which was recently reported to cause severe lower respiratory tract infection in China.
In general, when these human coronaviruses acquire the ability to be transmitted efficiently and maintained continuously in humans, they also become less virulent or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient who had developed acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although the majority of laboratory-confirmed cases originate in the Middle East, there have been reports of imported cases with occasional contagion to close contacts in several European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS resemble those of SARS, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also developed acute kidney failure, which so far only occurs with MERS among diseases caused by human coronavirus.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported, with a high lethality of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses known to humans.
From mid to late December 2019, clusters of pneumonia patients were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, which retrospectively became associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The World Health Organization has declared the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 to be a public health emergency of international importance and has also designated the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a crude case fatality rate of 3.4%.
Notably, lethality in Hubei, China, is 4.2%, while outside of it it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infection, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which presents as fever, cough, and dyspnea.
Diarrhea has also been observed in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can quickly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to a high nucleotide sequence homology of 82%, they are categorized into different branches of the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but more transmissible compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Cases of asymptomatic people infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, which could contribute to its rapid spread worldwide.
When comparing and contrasting SARS-CoV-2 with the other six human coronaviruses, similarities and differences of great interest are identified.
First, the incubation period and the duration of the course of human coronavirus disease are very similar.
In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six human coronaviruses.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms lies between that of SARS-CoV and the four community-acquired human coronaviruses (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection presents characteristics that are more frequently observed in community-acquired human coronavirus infections, including the presentation of non-specific or mild symptoms or even the absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subgroup of severe COVID-19 cases is also observed, as is the case with SARS-CoV infection, although the relationship is slightly lower.
Third, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns characteristic of both community-acquired human coronaviruses and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of community-acquired human coronaviruses.
On the other hand, it remains to verify whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after passing between humans, as happens with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, as with the other human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.
Whether faecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role, as in the case of SARS-CoV, at least in some circumstances, should still be elucidated in future studies.
It is also of particular interest to find out whether SARS-CoV-2 could exhibit seasonality, as is the case with community-acquired human coronaviruses.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable spread after human-to-human passage, will influence the final outcome of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
The four community-acquired human coronaviruses that cause mild symptoms have adapted well to humans.
From another perspective, it might also be true that humans have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, both could be survivors of ancient human coronavirus pandemics.
Coronaviruses have been eliminated from humans that cause serious diseases in humans and humans that developed serious diseases from human coronaviruses.
For this to happen, human coronaviruses must replicate in humans to a sufficient extent to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that counteract host restriction factors.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak persists and the more people it infects, the more likely it is to fully adapt to humans.
If well adapted, its transmission in humans would be difficult to stop by quarantine or other infection control measures.
For many years, the four community-acquired coronaviruses have circulated in human populations and caused common colds in immunocompetent people.
These viruses do not need an animal reservoir.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted well to humans and their transmission between humans is unsustainable.
They need to be maintained and propagated in their zoonotic reservoirs and seek the opportunity to propagate to susceptible human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has characteristics similar to both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and the four community-acquired human coronaviruses.
It is highly transmissible like the human coronaviruses acquired in the community, at least for the time being.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired human coronaviruses and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will fully adapt to humans and circulate among humans without a reservoir or intermediate animal host.
Before analyzing the animal origins of human coronaviruses, it will be useful to examine the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate and enhancer hosts of human coronaviruses.
An animal acts as an evolutionary host for a human coronavirus if it harbors a closely related ancestor that shares high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
The ancestral virus is normally well adapted and is not pathogenic in this host.
Similarly, a reservoir host hosts a human coronavirus on a continuous and long-term basis.
In both cases, the hosts are naturally infected and are the natural hosts of the human coronavirus or its parent virus.
In contrast, if the human coronavirus was introduced into the intermediate host just before or at about the same time as its introduction into humans, it is not well adapted to the new host and is usually pathogenic.
The intermediate host can act as the zoonotic source of infection in humans and fulfill the function of the amplifying host by allowing the virus to replicate transiently and then be transmitted to humans to amplify the scale of infection in humans.
A human coronavirus can cause infection in the terminal host if it cannot sustain transmission in the intermediate host.
In contrast, human coronaviruses can also adapt to the intermediate host and even generate long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reservoir host.
Epidemiological data revealed retrospectively that the initial case of SARS had had contact with game animals.
Further research on seroprevalence indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG compared to that of the general population.
Masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) and a raccoon dog in live animal markets were the first identified carriers of SARS-CoV-like viruses that are nearly identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no more cases of SARS were recorded after killing all the civets in the markets.
However, it was reported that wild or farm masked palm civets without exposure to live animal markets mostly tested negative for SARS-CoV, suggesting that masked palm civets would only act as an amplifying intermediate host, but not as a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
Notably, given that 80% of the various animals in Guangzhou markets have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibilities that several small mammal species also act as intermediate hosts amplifying SARS-CoV cannot be ruled out.
They all appear to be terminal SARS-CoV hosts.
Subsequent searches of the natural animal host of SARS-CoV revealed a closely related bat coronavirus, termed SARS-related Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in Chinese horseshoe bats.
These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
This and other bat coronaviruses share a nucleotide sequence homology of 88-92% with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the groundwork for the new concept that bats harbor emerging pathogens in humans.
Several SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoV) have also been identified in bats, but none, except one called WIV1, can be isolated as a live virus.
The human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known to be the SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1 obtained from a fecal sample of bats was shown to use ACE2 from bats, civets and humans as a receptor to enter cells.
Surprisingly, será from convalescent SARS patients were able to neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the most closely related ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% nucleotide sequence homology.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parental SARS-CoV virus and that bats are not the immediate reservoir host of SARS-CoV.
According to phylogenetic analysis, MERS-CoV is categorized in the same group as bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), for virus entry.
MERS-CoV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequences phylogenetically come closer to their bat betacoronavirus counterparts identified in Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoV can be found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest relative, bat CoV-HKU25, share a nucleotide sequence homology of only 87%.
Therefore, the bat may not be the immediate reservoir host of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromedaries are seropositive in MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies specifically, as are camels native to the Middle East in several African countries.
A live MERS-CoV identical to the virus found in humans was isolated from the nasal exudate of dromedaries, further supporting that camels act as bona fide reservoir hosts of MERS-CoV.
It should also be noted that, in general, mild symptoms were observed, but a massive spread of the virus in camels infected for research with MERS-CoV.
Notably, infected camels spread viruses not only through the respiratory tract, but also through the fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of virus spread by bats.
However, questions remain, as many confirmed cases of MERS have no history of contact with camels prior to the onset of symptoms, which is reasonably attributed to human-to-human transmission or unknown transmission pathways involving unrecognized animal species harboring MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide homology with a bat coronavirus, RaTG13, isolated from Rhinolophus affinis bats.
As in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to assign a parental relationship.
That is, bats might not be the immediate reservoir hosts of SARS-CoV-2 unless they are found in the future virtually identical bat coronavirus.
Presumably, the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2 should be among the wild species that are sold and killed in the wholesale seafood market of Huanan, with which many of the initial cases of COVID-19 were associated, indicating a probable animal-to-human transmission event.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of endangered small mammals, known as pangolins (Manis javanica), may also harbor ancestral betacoronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2.
The genomes of this novel pangolin coronavirus share 85-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are equally closely related to RaTG13, with about 90% identity at the nucleotide sequence level.
They are grouped into two sublineages of viruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a receptor binding domain (RBD) more similar to SARS-CoV-2, with an amino acid sequence identity of 97.4%.
In stark contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are more divergent, despite a greater degree of genome-wide sequence homology.
A previous study in sick pangolins also reported the detection of viral contigs in lung samples, which turn out to be equally related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted different methods of manual assembly and healing to generate a partial genome sequence comprising about 86.3% of the full-length viral genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility that the pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support a direct origin in the pangolin of SARS-CoV-2 due to sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 related pangolin betacoronaviruses.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even smaller than that between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-related pangolin betacoronaviruses.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals has yet to be established.
Although the highest sequence homology was found in the RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, the SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2, and RaTG13 related betacoronaviruses share the highest complete genome sequence homology.
It is highly speculative that the high degree of similarity between the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 related pangolins betacoronaviruses is due to selectivity-mediated convergent evolution.
A counter-proposal advocates a recombination between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 related pangolins beta-coronaviruses in the third wild animal species.
As a driving force in evolution, recombination is widespread among betacoronaviruses.
A conclusion on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been reached.
In addition to highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 was also studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicated that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E could have originated from bat coronavirus, while parental viruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in rodents.
A bat coronavirus called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Mountain Coronavirus) detected in a North American tricolor bat was reported to be closely related to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another bat coronavirus, named Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, although camelids have also been suspected as intermediate hosts.
For clarity, the knowledge thus far of the animal origins of known human coronaviruses is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of human-to-species coronavirus transmission events in history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed species to infect humans from livestock in 1890, a respiratory infection pandemic was recorded.
The background of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is not so precisely known.
Alphacoronavirus from bats closely related to HCoV-229E has been found.
Among them is an alpaca alphacoronavirus.
Several lines of evidence support the transmission of the bat virus to humans directly.
First, unlike alpacas, humans could have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
Instead, humans have close contact with alpacas.
Second, HCoV-229E-related bat alpha-coronaviruses are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, while alpaca alpha-coronaviruses caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpacas alphacoronavirus has not been found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility that alpacas acquire HCoV-229E-related alphacoronavirus from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are the direct source of pathogenic viruses in humans, such as rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it would not be too surprising if bats transmitted HCoV-229E to humans directly.
Alternatively, while bat alpha-coronaviruses act as a gene pool for HCoV-229E, alpacas and dromedaries could act as intermediate hosts that transmit the viruses to humans, specifically in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of interspecies transmission, from bats to dromedaries, and from dromedaries to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV in bats is discovered with their initial identification, and has also been supported by later findings.
It is evident that bats contribute, with a profuse collection of virus species, to the exchange of genetic fragments between species and to the transmission between species.
Longevity, densely populated colonies, close social interaction, and the great ability to fly are all favorable conditions that make bats the ideal “virus spreader.”
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been introduced into dromedaries for decades.
It is well adapted to these camels, which have gone from being an intermediate host, to being a stable and natural reservoir host.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
Its sporadic transmission to humans is an accident and humans remain a terminal host of MERS-CoV, as transmission is unsustainable.
Compared to the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins, if any, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is different.
In particular, pangolins betacoronaviruses are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They may be a terminal host for SARS-CoV-2 related betacoronaviruses, such as civets in the case of SARS-CoV.
Several possibilities of cross-species transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans need to be confirmed or ruled out in future studies.
First, bats could be the reservoir host of a SARS-CoV-2-related virus, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share the ecological niche with bats, through killing or coal mining.
Second, pangolins could be one of the intermediate amplifying hosts into which a SARS-CoV-2-related virus had recently been introduced.
Humans contract the virus through the killing and consumption of game meat.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
A study of antibodies in domestic and wild animals is necessary.
Third, as mentioned above, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in a third species that has contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 continues.
Apart from the different types of animal hosts, three main factors in viral terms also play an important role in facilitating coronaviruses to cross species barriers.
First, their relatively high mutation rates in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rates of coronaviruses could be considered "moderate" to "high", with an average substitution rate of <0x7E>10-4 substitutions per year, per site 2, depending on the adaptation phase of the coronavirus to new hosts.
Coronaviruses have a read-check exoribonuclease, the elimination of which results in extremely high mutability and attenuation or even infeasibility.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue remdesivir is known to suppress replication of the coronavirus by inhibiting this exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents tested in clinical trials.
However, the mutation rates of coronaviruses are about a million times higher than those of their hosts.
In addition, the mutation rate is usually high when coronaviruses are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, which has a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently lower, suggesting a higher level of adaptation to humans.
Hopefully, it has already adapted to another host close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to dromedaries.
In theory, genetic drift is unlikely to cause SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and antivirals to lose their effectiveness rapidly.
Second, the long RNA genome of coronaviruses exerts additional plasticity in modifying the genome for mutations and recombination and thus increases the likelihood of coevolution between species, leading to the emergence of new coronaviruses when the right conditions are present.
This is supported by copious unique open reading frames and the functions of proteins encoded towards the 3' direction of the genome.
Third, coronaviruses change randomly and frequently from templates during RNA replication by a unique "copy-choice" mechanism.
In a host acting as a mixing vehicle, the chain change frequently occurs during RNA transcription of the coronavirus.
Full-length and highly homologous subgenomic RNAs could be recombined to generate new coronaviruses.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal coronaviruses such as bat SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9.
Virus-host interaction in connection with transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with the host receptor is another key factor influencing interspecies transmission.
Herein, SARS-CoV recombination is taken as a typical example, which also showed evidence of positive selection in interspecies transmission events.
Based on comparative analysis between isolated strains of SARS-CoV from humans and civets, it is believed that SARS-CoV undergoes rapid adaptation in different hosts, in particular with mutations in the RBD of the S protein.
In general, the RBD of the S protein of a coronavirus interacts with the cellular receptor and is selected intensely by the antibody response of the host.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is found at amino acids 318 to 510 in the S1 fragment, which binds to human ACE2 and its co-receptors for viral entry.
The SARS-CoV RBD is able to recognize ACE2 receptors from several animals, including bat, civet, mouse and raccoon dog, allowing interspecies transmission of the virus.
In fact, as observed, only 6 amino acid residues were different from isolated strains of human and civet viruses in the RBD and 4 of them are in the receptor binding motif for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Civet SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which could increase the affinity of the spike protein interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions could be fundamental for the adaptation of the virus to humans.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor with SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the S protein implies that the binding affinity of the S protein to human ACE2 could have been altered.
In fact, an electron cryomicroscopy study points to the 10- to 20-fold higher affinity of this binding compared to that of human ACE2 and SARS-CoV protein S.
It will also be of interest to determine whether any other co-receptors might be necessary for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Surprisingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2, but with a different part of S.
There are many other human coronavirus receptors, such as aminopeptidase N in HCoV-229E and sialic acid 9-O-acetylated in HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses in humans, following interspecies transmission from their animal hosts.
In addition to cellular receptors, the outcome of interspecies transmission of human coronaviruses is also determined by other factors of host dependence and restriction.
The divergence of these host proteins between humans and the natural reservoir hosts of human coronaviruses, such as bats, dromedaries and rodents, could constitute an obstacle to interspecies transmission.
Human coronaviruses must usurp host dependence factors and subvert host restriction factors for interspecies transmission to be successful.
In this regard, the molecular determinants in this important area of virus-host interaction have yet to be identified and characterized.
An objective full genome investigation of host dependence and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 using state-of-the-art CRISPR technology could be beneficial.
The emergence of new coronaviruses in humans: let’s start from scratch
The diversity of bat coronaviruses provides numerous opportunities for the emergence of new human coronaviruses.
In this sense, bat coronaviruses act as the gene pool of human coronaviruses.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also drive the evolution of human coronaviruses and constitute two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-coding genes have the potential to drastically modify viral phenotypes.
Among the accessory proteins of SARS-CoV, ORF8 has been considered important in adaptation to humans, as viruses from SARS-CoV-related bats were isolated, but were determined to encode divergent ORF8 proteins.
A characteristic 29-nucleotide deletion of SARS-CoV was found in isolated strains at the onset of the epidemic in humans.
This deletion divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is believed to be an adaptive mutation that promotes host switching.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a possible history of recombination with alpha and gamma coronavirus lineages, in which a large number of smaller recombinant regions were identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Locations of recombinations in nsp9, most of nsp10 and parts of nsp14 were also identified.
Similarly, epidemic MERS-CoV has been shown to undergo recombination events between different lineages, which occurred in dromedaries in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other human coronaviruses, in which human coronaviruses recombine with other animal coronaviruses in their non-structural genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection may contribute to unwanted changes in viral genomes, which most likely result from freeing viruses from selection pressures exerted, for example, by the host immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of a full-length ORF4 in the prototype strain of HCoV-229E, due to a deletion of two nucleotides.
Although intact ORF4 could be observed in HCoV-229E-related bat and camel viruses, alpacas alphacoronavirus exhibits a single nucleotide insertion, resulting in a frame shift.
Last but not least, the evolution of new human coronaviruses is also driven by selection pressure in their reservoir hosts.
No or only mild symptoms were detected when bats were infected with coronavirus, indicating mutual adaptation between coronaviruses and bats.
Bats appear to be well adapted to coronaviruses anatomically and physiologically.
For example, defects in the activation of the proinflammatory response in bats efficiently reduces the pathology caused by coronaviruses.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in bats is suppressed due to upregulation of the natural killer cell inhibitory receptor NKG2/CD94 and the low level of expression of the class I molecules of the major histocompatibility complex.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from bats' elevated metabolic activity could suppress coronavirus replication and affect the reading check of exoribonuclease, providing selection pressure for the generation of highly pathogenic virus strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic coronavirus strains could also evolve by recombination, which would lead to the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for host adaptation.
Therefore, it is no coincidence that three new human coronaviruses have appeared in the last two decades.
Coronaviruses are non-pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir hosts, such as bats and camels.
They replicate vigorously without eliciting a strong immune response from the host.
Herein lie the secrets of why asymptomatic carriers exist and what causes severe cases of infection in humans.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to overactivation of the immune response and cytokine storm, in which the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response has been dissociated from the replication of the coronavirus.
The same immune response unbinding strategy could have beneficial effects on anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is especially strong in bats.
Therefore, administration of type I interferon, at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, should be beneficial.
In addition, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in bats is defective.
According to this reasoning, inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general line that led to the emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Although a bat betacoronavirus has been found to share 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, there is also a bat coronavirus that shares 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although civets and other market animals have been determined to harbor viruses identical to SARS-CoV, no immediate intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 have been identified.
Pangolin beta-coronaviruses have been found to be remarkably homologous to SARS-CoV-2, indicating that pangolins could act as one of the intermediate hosts or that pangolin beta-coronaviruses could contribute gene fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is man-made, either deliberately or by accident.
Coronaviruses have regained prominence due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of coronaviruses in bats and other animals has profoundly changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs of human coronaviruses in human transmission.
Extensive evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats and are transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts.
Since SARS-CoV infection originates from contact between humans and civets in markets, closing wet markets and killing the civets in them could have been effective in curbing the SARS epidemic.
Following the same reasoning, pangolins should be removed from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, given the discovery of several pangolin betacoronavirus lineages closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, whether and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other mammals remains to be elucidated in future research.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in dromedaries for a long time.
These camels are an important transportation tool, as well as a main source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the local population.
They are widely distributed throughout the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as was done in China with wild animal markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To prevent recurrent outbreaks of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop effective MERS-CoV vaccines for camels, in combination with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes that cause outbreaks could appear.
A variety of zoonotic coronaviruses are circulating in the wild.
In particular, bat coronaviruses with zoonotic potential are very diverse.
There is a high chance that these zoonotic coronaviruses will evolve and recombine, leading to the emergence of new coronaviruses that are more transmissible or more deadly in humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some places in China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
From the bad experiences with SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparedness and response plan should be adopted.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until an opportunity to spread presents itself.
Although bats have many characteristics that favor the spread of viruses, opportunities for human contact with bats and other wildlife can be minimized by educating the population to stay away from them.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of coronaviruses and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonoses is for humans to stay away from the ecological niches of the natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.
Several pieces are still missing in the puzzle of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
First, if bats transmit an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it will be interesting to analyze under what circumstances bats and pangolins might share the same ecological niche.
Second, if bats have a more direct role in human transmission, how humans come into contact with bats should be determined.
Third, if a third mammal acts as the true intermediate host, it must be elucidated how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats, and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, might be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, surveillance and experimental infection should be carried out.
Whether a bat, pangolin or other mammal, SARS-CoV-2 or its parent viruses that are nearly identical are expected to be identified in their natural hosts in the future.
Ongoing research in this area will elucidate the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria for "suspicious cases" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19
On February 6, 2020, our team published a rapid advisory guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of new coronavirus infection 2019 (2019-nCoV), and this guideline included our experience and is a good reference to fight this pandemic worldwide.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge gradually increase based on the results of ongoing research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our guideline and provided the most recent diagnostic criteria of “suspicious case” and “confirmed case” according to the latest Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 (seventh edition) published by the National Health Committee of the People’s Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) triggered an outbreak, which is now officially known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, the WHO classified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a rapid counseling guideline that was published online in Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
It has attracted a lot of attention since it was published.
However, it should be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge gradually increase based on the results of ongoing research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
For example, the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 published by the National Health Committee of the People’s Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020, have published a total of seven issues and some contexts have changed considerably.
Now, our guideline received a comment from Zhou et al., they submitted a simple classification proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their work added new evidence to our guideline and also constitutes a valuable reference for this pandemic worldwide.
We support their important work and express our appreciation.
However, their work also needs updating according to the latest Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 (seventh version of the trial) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (March 3, 2020), to confirm a suspected case it is necessary to combine any point of the epidemiological history characteristics with two points of the clinical manifestations to make a comprehensive analysis, or three points of the clinical manifestations must be fulfilled if there is no clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and surrounding areas, or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (2) history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 occurred before (with positive nucleic acid test), (4) history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in the city of Wuhan and 2 previous cases of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 occurred (with positive nucleic acid test), etc.
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever or respiratory symptoms; (2) features on COVID-19 infection images; (3) total white blood cell counts showing a normal, decreased or reduced lymphocyte count at the early onset stage.
The diagnosis of a confirmed case should be based on a suspected case with some characteristic of pathogenic or serological tests as follows: (1) real-time polymerase chain reaction test positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) sequencing of the entire viral genome showing a high homogeneity to the recognized novel coronavirus; (3) positive test for the specific IgM antibody or the specific IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2; (2) sequencing of the entire viral genome showing a high homogeneity to the recognized novel coronavirus; (3) positive result for the specific IgV antibody or IgG-2 antibody to its specific to SARS-CoV in a specific antibody.
We can see that the real-time polymerase chain reaction test for detecting nucleic acid in blood or airway samples was added to the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions.
Pathogen detection of blood samples was added to the fourth (January 27, 2020) and fifth (February 8, 2020) editions; and then, serological tests were added to the seventh edition.
<0x7B>NS<0x7D>
In addition, there is more and more evidence that reminds us that we must be cautious with asymptomatic and atypical symptomatic patients.
Therefore, the flowchart of Zhou et al. should be updated, as they classified the person without clinical symptoms as "low risk."
The scoring system should also be verified in other studies and clinical practices.
To conclude, we hope that more direct evidence will emerge and we ask readers to send us their comments.

Bangladesh reports five new COVID-19 deaths, highest number in one day
Bangladesh confirmed today five new deaths from COVID-19 in one day.
It is the highest number of deaths in a day due to the virus.
Until yesterday, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) of Bangladesh reported that the number of registered infected cases included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases who were staying in their homes.
A total of 17 deaths have been reported.
In an online briefing, IEDCR director Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora said the victims were four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were over 60 years old, two between 51 and 60 years old and one between 41 and 50 years old.
He also said two of the victims were from Dhaka.
On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
An official at the hospital told Anadolu Agency, a local news outlet, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Bangladesh’s Minister of Road and Bridge Transport Obaidul Quader said public transport would be suspended for longer than initially planned, until next Saturday.
This suspension of public transport had initially started on 26 March and was scheduled to end on Saturday 4 April.
The transport of essential goods such as medical supplies, fuel and food was still allowed.
The first recorded cases of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh occurred on March 8, involving two men who returned from Italy and also the wife of one of them.
By March 19, these three had recovered.
More than one million SARS-CoV-2 infections worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infections exceeded one million worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52,000 deaths were related to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
The milestone took place on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infections and Zambia had its first coronavirus-related death.
North Korea said on Thursday it was one of the few countries without coronavirus infections.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the 24 hours prior to 10:00 a.m., European Central Time (UTC-0800), on April 4.
In the United States, there were more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus, linked to at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reported, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, that there were more than 1,000 deaths in the United States on Wednesday caused by coronavirus infections.
Around the world, countries have announced stricter measures to inhibit the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the city’s closure until May 1.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin declared that the Russians would continue to receive their salaries without going to work until April 30.
The Parliament of Portugal voted to extend the national state of emergency for 15 days; the vote was passed with 215 votes in favor, ten abstentions and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended curfews in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina throughout the day; previously, the curfew was only maintained between 3:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.
Thailand planned to implement a curfew between 10:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m.
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine announced that the state had extended his order to stay home until May 1.
Supermarkets in Australia Lower Toilet Paper Limits Per Transaction
On Sunday and Saturday afternoon, Australian supermarket chains Woolworths and Coles lowered their toilet paper purchase limits to two and one package per transaction at all supermarkets in the country, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also enforced a package cap.
These limitations were posted as messages on the chains’ boxes and Facebook pages.
Consumers were reportedly stocking up for fear of COVID-19 in case people had to self-isolate.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited purchases of toilet paper for home delivery to one package per order.
These changes were introduced after the previous restriction of four packages per transaction applied by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles, in its March 8 press release, reported that, with the four-pack restriction in place, “many supermarkets still run out of product within an hour of delivery,” and said the demand was “unprecedented,” while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, said it was “unexpected.”
Sales rose "strongly" last week, according to a Woolworths spokesman.
The Costco supermarket in Canberra also limited the amount to two packages last week.
To further alleviate shortages, Coles requested larger packages from suppliers and increased the frequency of deliveries, Woolworths ordered additional stock, while ALDI made stock available for a special Wednesday offer planned in advance.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers are trying to increase stocks, but local council restrictions on truck delivery times make it difficult.
It predicts an increase in production costs, as suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer offers.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that, following the early release of stocks, some supermarkets are unable to make Wednesday’s special offer.
In a report on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, said supermarkets stock up every night.
He pointed out that toilet paper is a bulky item, which causes a low amount of stock in numbers, and, when depleted, leaves a large empty space on the shelves, which intensifies the feeling of scarcity.
Coles and Woolworths have the idea that [that] if there was an abundant amount of the item on the shelves, if products like toilet paper rolls and disinfectants could [be bought] and there were large quantities, panic would probably be minimized, Russell Zimmerman told ABC News.
Recycled toilet paper maker Who Gives a Crap said last Wednesday that it ran out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, which makes Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, which makes Sorbent, said they were working around the clock, 7 days a week, to maintain supply, according to the report on News.com.au.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that some property sellers offered free toilet paper to the first bidder at auctions in Melbourne, when fewer auctions were held because buyers had free time on the long Labor Day weekend.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a Darwin-printed newspaper, included an eight-page insert designed to be cut and used as toilet paper.
Supermarkets were initially reluctant to impose restrictions, according to an ABC Australia report on March 3, in which they said they had no plans to introduce restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including face masks, disinfectant, dry products, liquid soap and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia on Sunday afternoon it was noted that the British online supermarket Ocado limited purchases of Andres toilet paper to two 12-roll packs.
World Health Organization declares COVID-19 pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a pandemic the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.
Although the word “pandemic” only refers to the extent of a disease’s spread, not how dangerous specific cases are, WHO stressed the need to push governments to take action:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries detect, test, treat, isolate, identify and mobilize their inhabitants in response, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.
We are very concerned, both by the alarming levels of spread and severity, and by the alarming levels of inaction.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is “unprecedented.”
In statements released by CNN in February, he claimed, “In addition to influenza, no other respiratory virus has been traced from the onset to the continued global spread.”
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar opinion, saying "we have never before seen a pandemic triggered by a coronavirus."
“And we’ve never before seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time,” he added.
The new pandemic status follows the WHO decision in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
The director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the outbreak, “In conclusion, it’s going to get worse.”
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, and more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020, and recognized as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, and around 97,000 deaths as a result.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
The case fatality rate is estimated to be 4% in China, while globally it ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
There is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment.
The primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy.Recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering your mouth when coughing, keeping your distance from other people, and controlling and isolating people you suspect are infected.
Authorities around the world responded by implementing travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace hazard controls and facility closures.
The pandemic led to severe global socio-economic disruption, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread shortages of supplies exacerbated by panic-driven purchases.
Schools and universities closed nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of the world’s student population.
Misinformation about the virus was disseminated over the Internet, and there were incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, other people of East and South-East Asian descent and appearance, and others from areas with significant virus cases.
Due to reduced travel and closures of heavy industry, there was a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
On December 31, 2019, health authorities in Wuhan, China, (the capital of Hubei province) reported a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause, and an investigation was initiated in early January 2020.
The cases, for the most part, were related to the wholesale seafood market of Huanan, therefore, the virus was thought to have a zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus closely related to bat coronaviruses, pangolins coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. It was later discovered that the first person who was known to show symptoms became ill on December 1, 2019, and that person had no visible connections to the last group on the wet market.
Of the first group of cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds were determined to have a link to the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post suggested that, a case dating back to November 17, 2019, of a 55-year-old person from Hubei province, could have been the first. On February 26, 2020, the WHO reported that, as the number of new cases, it was reported, had first exceeded new cases in China but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China.
There may be a considerable number of unreported cases, especially among those with milder symptoms.
As of 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported in young people, and those aged 19 and under accounted for 2.4% of cases worldwide.Patrick Vallance, the UK’s chief scientific adviser, estimated that 60% of the British population would have to become infected before effective collective immunity could be achieved.
The cases refer to the number of people who underwent COVID-19 tests, and who obtained a confirmed positive result according to official protocols.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries have had official no-testing policies on people who only had mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March revealed that, in China, as of 23 January, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections had gone undetected, and that these unregistered infections were the source of infection in 79% of recorded cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the numbers of infections in Italy were considerably higher than the reported cases.
Initial estimates of the basic reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention determined that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not, the time from the development of the symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, most often 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths had been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, about 80 percent of deaths were people over the age of 60, and 75 percent had pre-existing diseases, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official COVID-19 pandemic death records typically refer to deceased people who tested positive for COVID, according to official protocols.
The number of actual deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher, as people who died without testing, for example, in their homes, nursing homes, etc., may not be included.
Partial data from Italy revealed that the number of additional deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID death record by a factor of 4 to 5 times.
A spokesman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted "We know [the number of reported deaths] is an understatement," a claim corroborated by anecdotal reports of undercounting in the United States. This understatement is common in pandemics such as the first H1N1 swine flu pandemic of 2009.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on February 1 in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on February 14.
As of Feb. 28, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths have been recorded in each of the countries of Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As of 13 March, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths, on all continents except Antarctica. Various indicators are generally used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the amount of evidence, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, the time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, sex, and general health.The proportion of deaths over cases reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a given time interval.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the global proportion of deaths over cases is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, estimates of the proportion of deaths over cases decreased from 17.3% (in those with onset of symptoms from January 1 to 10, 2020) to 0.7% (in those with onset of symptoms after February 1, 2020). Other indicators include the case fatality rate, which reflects the percentage of people diagnosed with an infectious disease who died as a result of a disease, and the mortality rate from infections, which does not reflect the percentage of people diagnosed with an infection.
These statistics do not have a specific time frame and consider a specific population from infection to case resolution.
Some academics have attempted to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford estimates that the case fatality rate for pandemic infections as a whole is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The top estimate of this range is consistent with the results of the first random tests for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study that analyzed the impact of the tests on case-fatality rate estimates.
The WHO says the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and final duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may differ by location.
Maciej Boni of Pennsylvania State University said, "Infectious outbreaks, if left unchecked, generally stabilize and then begin to decline when the disease runs out of available hosts.
But, at the moment, it’s almost impossible to make any reasonable forecast of when that will happen.”
The Chinese government’s top medical adviser, Zhong Nanshan, said it “could end in June” if all countries can be mobilized to follow WHO’s recommendation on measures to halt the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said SARS-CoV-2 "will remain circulating, possibly for one or two years."
According to the Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be necessary “until a vaccine is available (possibly 18 months or more).”
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, “I think it’s unlikely that this coronavirus, given that it’s transmitted so easily, will disappear completely” and “could become a seasonal disease, reappearing every year.”
The virulence of the recurrence would depend on the collective immunity and the magnitude of the mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively non-specific and infected people can be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less frequent symptoms include fatigue, production of sputum in the airways (phlegm), loss of sense of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhoea or cyanosis.
According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), emergency symptoms include shortness of breath, persistent chest pressure or pain, sudden confusion, trouble waking up, and bluish color of the face or lips; if these symptoms occur, immediate medical attention is recommended.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, presenting no clinical symptoms, although the test results confirm the infection, therefore, the researchers advised to carefully monitor and examine those who have close contact with confirmed infected people in order to rule out the infection.
Chinese estimates of the proportion of asymptomatic people range from a few to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between infection and the onset of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; more often it is 5 days. As an example of the uncertainty, the estimate of the proportion of people with COVID-19 who lost their sense of smell at first was 30% and then decreased to 15%.
Some details of how the disease spreads are still being determined.
The disease is thought to spread primarily during close contact and through the small droplets that occur when coughing, sneezing, or talking; close contact is considered a distance of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
According to studies, when coughing without covering their mouth, droplets can travel from 15 feet (4.5 meters) to 27 feet (8.2 meters).
Some have proposed that the virus can also be transmitted through small droplets that remain in the air for longer periods, which can be generated by talking. Respiratory droplets can also occur during exhalation, even when talking, although the virus is usually not transmitted through the air.
Droplets can enter the mouth or nose of people who are nearby or possibly inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can cause aerosolization of respiratory secretions and, therefore, airborne spread.
It can also spread when you touch a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touch your eyes, nose, or mouth.
While there is concern that it may be transmitted through feces, this risk is believed to be low.
The Government of China denied the possibility of oral fecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2.The virus is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although spread may be possible before symptoms manifest and in more advanced stages of the disease.
People tested positive for the disease up to three days before symptoms appeared, indicating that transmission is possible before significant symptoms develop.
There are only a few laboratory-confirmed reports of asymptomatic cases, but some countries have identified asymptomatic transmission during contact tracing investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) maintains that while it is not completely clear how easily the disease spreads, usually one person infects two or three others. The virus survives from hours to days on surfaces.
Specifically, the virus was determined to be detectable for up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, one day in cardboard and up to four hours in copper.
This, however, varies according to humidity and temperature. Positive results were obtained in COVID-19 tests performed on pets and other animals.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although British authorities recommend washing hands after contact with animals, as well as after contact with other surfaces that could have touched infected people.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia linked to the cluster of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in related coronaviruses in nature. Outside the human body, the virus dies upon contact with soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is believed to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analyses revealed that the coronavirus is genetically grouped with the genus betacoronavirus, its subgenus sarbecovirus (B lineage) along with two strains derived from the bat.
At the whole genome level, it is 96% identical to other bat coronavirus (BatCov RaTG13) samples.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one difference in amino acids in certain parts of the genome sequences between pangolins viruses and those of humans.
To date, genome-wide comparison indicated that pangolins coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 share at most 92% of the genetic material, which is not sufficient to demonstrate that pangolins are the intermediate host.
Virus infection can be provisionally diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, although it is ultimately confirmed through reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or by computed tomography imaging.
According to a study in Wuhan comparing the polymerase chain reaction to computed tomography, computed tomography is much more sensitive than the polymerase chain reaction, although less specific, and many of the features in the images match the processes of other diseases and pneumonias.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends “not using computed tomography as a screening method or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19.”
The WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on January 17.
The test uses polymerase chain reaction with real-time reverse transcriptase (rRT-PCR).
The test can be done on blood or respiratory samples.
Results are usually available within a few hours or days.
This test is usually done with a nasopharyngeal swab, although a throat swab may also be used.Some labs and companies are developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of these proved to be accurate enough for widespread use to be approved.
In the U.S., a serological test developed by Cellex was approved for emergency use by certified laboratories only.
Characteristic features on X-ray and computed tomography (CT) images of symptomatic individuals include asymmetric peripheral fading glass opacities and absent pleural effusions.
The Italian Society of Radiology is compiling an international online database of the results obtained in confirmed case images.
Due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, unconfirmed imaging by polymerase chain reaction has limited specificity in identifying COVID-19.
A large study carried out in China compared the results of CT scans of the chest with those of the polymerase chain reaction and showed that, although the diagnosis by imaging is less specific for the infection, it is faster and more sensitive, which suggests its consideration as a detection tool in the areas affected by the epidemic.
Convolutional neural networks based on artificial intelligence were developed to detect characteristics of the virus in the images, both with x-rays and computed tomography.
Strategies to prevent transmission of the disease include maintaining good general personal hygiene, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with your hands without washing them first, and sneezing or coughing on a tissue and throwing the tissue directly into a waste container.
It is recommended that those who may already be infected wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission; many governments have restricted or discouraged all non-essential travel to and from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached the stage of community spread in many parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some community members do not know where or how they became infected. It is recommended that health care providers caring for someone who might be infected take standard precautions, contact precautions, and use eye protection. Contact tracing is an important method for health authorities to determine the origin of an infection and to prevent further transmission.
Governments’ use of mobile phone location data for this purpose has raised privacy concerns, and Amnesty International and more than 100 other organisations have issued a statement demanding limits on this kind of surveillance.
Several mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record a user’s proximity to other cell phones.
Users then receive a message if they were in close contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19. Misconceptions about how to prevent infection are circulating; for example, nasal lavage and mouthwash gargles are not effective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19, although many organizations are working to develop one.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after using the bathroom or when their hands are visibly dirty; before eating and after blowing their nose, coughing or sneezing.
This is because, outside the human body, the virus dies when it comes into contact with soap, which disintegrates its protective bubble.
The CDC also recommended using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol by volume when soap and water are not available.
The WHO recommends people avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with their hands without washing them first.
Surfaces can be decontaminated with various solutions (within one minute of exposure to disinfectant on a stainless steel surface), including 62–71% ethanol, 50–100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2–7.5% povidone iodine.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
CDC recommends that if a case of COVID is suspected or confirmed in a facility, such as an office or daycare, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common spaces, shared electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATMs used by sick people be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with a bent elbow or a tissue for coughing or sneezing, and discard the tissue immediately.
It is recommended that those who might be infected wear surgical masks, as wearing a mask can limit the volume and distance traveled by respiratory droplets that disperse when speaking, sneezing, and coughing.
The WHO issued instructions on when and how to use the masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Using a mask can reduce the tendency [of] people to touch their face, which is an important source of infection without proper hand hygiene."
The WHO has recommended the use of masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, for example, those caring for a person with COVID-19, although it also recognizes that wearing masks can help people avoid touching their face.
Several countries have begun to encourage the use of face masks by the public.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends wearing non-medical masks made from fabric. China specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks by healthy members of the public, especially when they are in close contact (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask to take public transportation or be in crowded places.
Thailand’s health officials recommend people make cloth masks in their homes and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia banned people from entering public spaces without wearing a mask or covering their noses and mouths.
On March 16, Vietnam requested that all people wear a mask when in public spaces to be able to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has demanded the use of face masks by all people entering a supermarket.
Israel requested that all residents wear masks in public.
Taiwan, which has manufactured 10 million masks per day since mid-March, on April 1 demanded the use of masks by passengers on intercity trains and buses.
Panama imposed the mandatory use of masks to go outdoors, while also recommending the manufacture of homemade masks to those who can not buy them.
Masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes infection control measures designed to slow the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between people.
Methods include quarantines, travel restrictions, and the closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, and shopping centers.
People can implement methods of social distancing by staying in their homes, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using forms of greeting that do not include contact, and physically distancing themselves from other people.
Many governments now demand or recommend social distancing in regions affected by the outbreak.
The maximum meeting size recommended by U.S. government agencies and health organizations was quickly reduced from 250 people (if there was no known spread of COVID-19 in a region) to 50 people, and subsequently to 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. Older adults and those with underlying diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension and compromised immune systems are at an increased risk of serious illness and complications, and the CDC recommends that they stay away from physical contact as long as possible.
The use of the term "social distancing" has had an impact on the assumption that people should adopt complete social isolation, rather than encouraging them to keep in touch with others through alternative means.Some authorities have published sexual health guidelines for use during the pandemic.
They include recommendations to only have sex with a person with whom you live, who does not have the virus or symptoms of the virus.
Self-isolation at home was recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected of becoming infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions on proper self-isolation, and many governments have demanded or recommended self-quarantine of entire populations in affected areas.
The stricter self-quarantine instructions were issued for those belonging to high-risk groups.
People who may have been in contact with someone with COVID-19 and who have recently traveled to a country or region with widespread transmission are recommended to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of the last possible exposure.
Strategies to control an outbreak are containment or suppression and mitigation.
The containment is carried out in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to identify and isolate infected people, in addition to introducing other infection control measures and vaccines to prevent the disease from spreading to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to control the spread of the disease, efforts move to the mitigation phase: measures are taken to curb the spread and mitigate its effects on the health system and society.
A combination of containment and mitigation measures can be taken at the same time.
Suppression requires more extreme measures to be able to reverse the pandemic through reducing the basic number of reproduction to less than 1. Part of controlling the outbreak of an infectious disease involves trying to decrease the epidemic peak, which is known as flattening the curve of the epidemic.
This reduces the risk of health services collapsing and allows more time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can control the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, use of face masks and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing, such as school closures and cancellation of mass concurrence events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as overt environmental measures and surface cleaning.
Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea implemented mass screening assessments and localized quarantines, and issued alerts about the movements of infected people.
Singapore provided financial support to those infected who decided to quarantine and imposed large fines on those who did not.
Simulations in Britain and the United States show that mitigation (which slows the spread of the epidemic but does not stop it) and suppression (which reverses the growth of the pandemic) have major challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies could reduce peak demand for health care by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and the collapse of health systems.
Suppression may be preferred, but it should be maintained for as long as the virus circulates in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if that happens first), since otherwise transmission reactivates rapidly when measures are relaxed.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic entails social and economic costs.
There are no specific antiviral drugs approved for COVID-19, but efforts are underway to develop them, including testing existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter cold medications, drinking fluids, and resting can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and respiratory assistance may be needed.
The use of steroids can worsen the results.
Several compounds that were previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being investigated for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
The WHO also indicated that some “home and traditional remedies” can relieve symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO describes increasing capacity and adapting health care to the needs of COVID-19 patients as a key response measure to the outbreak.
The ECDC and WHO’s Regional Office for Europe have developed guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services for redistributing resources at different levels, including focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, cancelling elective procedures where possible, separating and isolating COVID-19-positive patients, and increasing intensive care capacities by training staff and increasing the number of available beds.
There are several theories about where the first case (the so-called patient zero) may have originated.
The first known case of the novel coronavirus can be traced back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Over the course of a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased.
These were mainly linked to the wholesale seafood market of Huanan, which also sold live animals, and one theory is that the virus came from one of these animals; or, in other words, that it has a zoonotic origin. On December 26, a series of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause was observed of which was reported by Dr. Zhang Jixian at the Hubei Provincial Hospital.
On Dec. 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a “coronavirus similar to SARS.”
Police admonished eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, for spreading false rumors, and another doctor, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by her superiors for raising the alarm.
Subsequently, on December 31, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public note and informed WHO.
In early January, enough cases of pneumonia of unknown cause had been reported to health authorities in Wuhan to initiate an investigation.During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, contributing to the Chinese New Year migration and the fact that Wuhan is a transportation hub and a major rail crossing.
On Jan. 20, China reported about 140 new cases in a day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Subsequent official data show that, as of January 20, 2020, 6174 people had already developed symptoms. As of March 26, the United States has surpassed China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. As of April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and more than 364,000 have recovered.
Around 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted free movement and established border controls.
National reactions have included containment measures, such as quarantines (known as stay-at-home orders, on-site shelter or confinement orders) and curfews. As of April 2, about 300 million people, or about 90 percent of the population, are in some form of confinement in the United States, over 50 million people are in confinement in the Philippines, about 59 million people are in India, and over 50 million people are in confinement in the Philippines.
As of March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were in some form of confinement, increasing to 2.6 billion people two days later, about a third of the world’s population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 dates back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report indicates that the first case occurred on November 17.
On December 26, Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown cause, and her hospital reported to Wuhan Jianghan CDC on December 27.
The first genetic tests of patient samples on December 27, 2019 indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
On December 31, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice.
The WHO was informed on the same day.
While these notifications were being made, police warned doctors in Wuhan for “spreading rumors” about the outbreak.
China’s National Health Commission initially claimed there was no “clear evidence” of human-to-human transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a drastic campaign, later described by Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping as a “people’s war,” to contain the spread of the virus.
In what was described as "the largest quarantine in human history", a cordon sanitaire banning travel in and out of Wuhan was announced on 23 January, extending to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, affecting a total of some 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles was banned in the city.
Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) were canceled in many places.
Authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Subsequently, another hospital, Leishenshan Hospital, was built to receive more patients.
In addition to the new hospitals built, China also converted 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as convention centers and stadiums, into temporary hospitals.On January 26, the government implemented more measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, which included issuing health statements for travelers and extending the Spring Festival holiday.
Universities and schools across the country were also closed.
The Hong Kong and Macau regions implemented a number of measures, especially in relation to schools and universities.
Remote work measures were established in several regions of China.
Travel restrictions were implemented inside and outside Hubei.
Public transport was modified and museums across China were temporarily closed.
Public movement control was implemented in several cities, and it has been estimated that around 760 million people (more than half the population) faced some kind of restriction on outdoor outings.After the start of the global phase of the outbreak in March, Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the “import” of the virus from other countries.
For example, Beijing has imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine for all international travelers entering the city. As of March 23, only one case had been transmitted nationally in the previous five days, this time through a traveler who returned from Istanbul to Canton.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang reported that the spread of nationally transmitted cases was basically blocked and that the outbreak had been controlled in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions were eased in Hubei, as well as Wuhan, two months after confinement was imposed.On March 26, 2020, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that entry of visa holders or residence permit would be suspended as of March 28, without specific details of when this policy will end.
Those wishing to enter China will need to apply for visas at Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government urged businesses and factories to reopen on March 30 and provided economic stimulus packages for firms. The State Council declared a day of mourning that will begin with a three-minute national moment of silence on April 4 at 10:00 a.m., coinciding with the Qingming Festival, although the central government asked families to pay their respects online to meet the physical distancing order.
On January 20, 2020, it was confirmed that COVID-19 had spread from China to South Korea.
On February 20, the country’s health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases, mainly attributed to a meeting in Daegu of a new religious movement known as the Church of Jesus Shincheonji.
It is suspected that Shincheonji devotees who visited Daegu from Wuhan were the origin of the outbreak.
As of February 22, of the church’s 9,336 followers, 1,261 or about 13% reported symptoms. On February 23, 2020, South Korea declared the highest alert level.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, which increased to 3150 on 29 February.
All South Korean military bases were quarantined after tests confirmed that three soldiers tested positive for the virus.
South Korea introduced what was considered the world’s largest and best-organized program to test the population for the virus and isolate infected people, as well as identify and quarantine those who came in contact with them.
Detection methods included mandatory self-reporting of symptoms by newcomers from other countries through a mobile app, drive-thru centers to test for the virus with results available the next day, and increased diagnostic capacity to be able to test up to 20,000 people every day.
South Korea’s program is considered a success in controlling the outbreak despite not adopting quarantine in entire cities. South Korean society was initially polarized regarding President Moon Jae-in’s response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions to demand Moon's removal for what they saw as mishandling the outbreak by the government, or to praise his response.
On March 23, South Korea was reported to have the lowest case total on a day in four weeks.
On 29 March, it was reported that, as of 1 April, all new arrivals from abroad should be quarantined for two weeks.
According to media reports, on April 1, South Korea received requests for assistance in testing the virus from 121 different countries.
On February 19, Iran reported its first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Qom, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died later that day.
Early measures announced by the government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural events, sporting events and Friday prayers, and the closure of universities, higher education institutions and schools.
Iran has earmarked 5 billion rials to fight the virus.
On February 26, 2020, President Hassan Rouhani said that there were no plans to quarantine the areas affected by the outbreak, and that only people would be quarantined.
In March, plans to limit travel between cities were announced, although heavy traffic between cities as a result of the Persian New Year Nowruz continued.
Shiite shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020. During February, Iran became a center of spread of the virus after China.
Amid claims of a cover-up of the magnitude of the outbreak in Iran, more than ten countries had traced their cases to Iran by February 28, indicating that the magnitude of the outbreak could be more serious than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government by that date.
The Iranian parliament was closed, and on March 3, 23 of its 290 members reported that they had tested positive for the virus.
On March 12, Human Rights Watch urged the Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent, and to also temporarily release all eligible prisoners.
He said there is a greater risk of the virus spreading in closed institutions, such as detention centers, which also lack adequate medical care.
On March 15, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in a single day, the highest number recorded in the country since the outbreak began.
As of 17 March, at least 12 former or current Iranian politicians had died from the disease.
As of March 23, Iran was experiencing 50 new cases per hour and one new death every ten minutes due to the coronavirus.
According to a WHO official, there may be five times as many cases in Iran as are reported.
It is also suggested that U.S. sanctions on Iran could be affecting the country’s financial capacity to respond to the viral outbreak.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has demanded relief from economic sanctions for the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On January 31, the outbreak was confirmed to have spread to Italy, when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
Cases began to rise rapidly, prompting the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
A cluster of unrelated COVID-19 cases was subsequently detected, beginning with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February.On 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced a new decree law to contain the outbreak, which included quarantine of more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "No one will be allowed to enter or leave the areas affected by the outbreak.
On 4 March, the Italian government ordered the complete closure of schools and universities across the country while Italy reached 100 deaths.
All major sporting events, including Serie A football matches, were to be held behind closed doors until April, but, on 9 March, all sporting events were completely suspended for at least one month.
On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte ordered the cessation of virtually all commercial activities except supermarkets and pharmacies. On 6 March, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published medical ethics recommendations on triage protocols that could be used.
On March 19, Italy overtook China as the country with the highest number of coronavirus-related deaths in the world after reporting 3405 deaths from the pandemic.
On March 22, it was reported that Russia had sent nine military aircraft with medical equipment to Italy.
As of 5 April, there were 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 recoveries in Italy, with the majority of those cases occurring in the Lombardy region.
A CNN report indicated that Italy’s combination of a large elderly population and inability to test all people who have the virus to date could contribute to the high case fatality rate.
The UK’s response to the virus first emerged as one of the most relaxed affected countries, and until March 18, 2020, the British government did not impose any kind of social distancing or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the Government received criticism for the apparent lack of speed and intensity in its response to the concerns faced by the public. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made an announcement in which he discouraged social contact and all non-essential travel, and suggested that people work from their homes when possible and avoid places such as bars, restaurants and theatres.
On 20 March, the Government announced the closure as soon as possible of all leisure establishments, such as bars and gyms, and promised to pay up to 80% of workers' wages up to a limit of GBP 2500 per month to prevent unemployment during the crisis.
Unlike previous measures, the police could enforce these restrictions through the imposition of fines and the dispersal of meetings.
Most of the companies were ordered closed, except for those considered "essential", including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, gas stations and workshops.

On January 28, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. Government’s premier public health institute, announced that they had developed their own test kit.
Despite doing so, the U.S. had a slow start in conducting tests, which masked the true magnitude of the outbreak at the time.
Testing was marred by faulty test kits produced by the federal government in February, the lack of federal approval of non-governmental test kits (from academies, companies, and hospitals) through the end of February, and restrictive criteria for individuals to qualify for a test through early March (after which a medical order was required).
As of February 27, the Washington Post reported that fewer than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States.
As of March 13, The Atlantic reported that fewer than 14,000 tests had been conducted.

On March 25, the governor said social distancing seemed to be working, as estimates of doubling cases went from 2 days to 4.7 days.
As of March 28, there were 32,308 confirmed cases in New York City, and 672 people had died from the virus. On March 26, it was reported that the United States had more confirmed coronavirus infections than any other country in the world, including China and Italy. As of April 8, 400,335 cases had been confirmed in the United States and 12,841 people had died.

General approval of Trump’s handling of the crisis has been polarized between party lines.
Some U.S. officials and commentators criticized the U.S. reliance on importing critical materials, including special medical supplies, from China.
An analysis of travel patterns was used to identify and predict patterns of spread and was published in The Journal of Travel Medicine in mid-January 2020.
Based on 2018 information from the International Air Transport Association, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Taipei had the most travelers from Wuhan.
Dubai, Sydney and Melbourne were also reported as popular destinations for people travelling from Wuhan.
Bali was reportedly the least capable city among the 20 most popular destination cities from a preparedness point of view, while cities in Australia were considered the most capable.On February 7, Australia released its New Coronavirus Emergency Response Plan (COVID-19).
It announced that much remained to be discovered about COVID-19, and that Australia would emphasize border control and communications in its response to the pandemic.
On 21 March, a human biosecurity emergency was declared in Australia.
Due to the effective quarantine of public transport in Wuhan and Hubei, several countries have planned to evacuate their citizens and diplomatic personnel from the area, mainly through charter flights from the country of origin, with authorization from the Chinese authorities.

Medical tests were done before take-off, and four South Africans who had signs of coronavirus had to stay to mitigate the risk.
Only South Africans who tested negative were repatriated.
The test results authorized all South Africans, including the flight crew, pilots, hotel staff, police and soldiers who participated in the humanitarian mission, who, as a preventive measure, remained under observation and quarantine for a period of 14 days at The Ranch Resort.
On March 20, the United States began to partially withdraw its troops from Iraq due to the pandemic.
On February 5, China’s foreign ministry said 21 countries (including Belarus, Pakistan, Trinidad and Tobago, Egypt and Iran) had sent aid to China.
Some Chinese students at U.S. universities joined together to help send aid to the regions of China affected by the virus, and a joint group in the Chicago metropolitan area reportedly managed to send 50,000 N95 masks to hospitals in Hubei province on Jan. 30. The humanitarian aid organization Direct Relief, in coordination with FedEx, on Jan. 30 sent 200,000 masks, in addition to other personal protective equipment to the hospital.

Entrepreneur Jack Ma sent 1.1 million test kits, 6 million masks and 60,000 protective suits to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, for distribution by the African Union.
He then sent 5,000 test kits, 100,000 masks and 5 respirators to Panama.
Ma also donated medical supplies to Canada, with the Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Georgia and the Czech Republic expressing concerns about masks and test kits made in China.
For example, Spain removed 58,000 Chinese-made coronavirus test kits with an accuracy rate of only 30%, while the Netherlands removed 600,000 defective Chinese masks.
Belgium removed 100,000 unusable masks, which were thought to be from China, but were actually from Colombia.
On the other hand, China’s aid was widely accepted in parts of Latin America and Africa. On 2 April, the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries.
The WHO praised the efforts of the Chinese authorities in controlling and containing the epidemic.
The WHO noted the difference between the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak, when Chinese authorities were accused of secrecy that impeded prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis, in which the central government “has provided periodic updates to avoid panic over the Lunar New Year holidays.”
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to implement a ban on transport in Wuhan, the representative of WHO Gauden Galea noted that, while "definitely not a recommendation that has been made by WHO", it was "a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic in the place where it is most concentrated".
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said ESPII was "due to the risk of global spread, especially to low- and middle-income countries without strong health systems".
In response to the implementation of the travel restrictions, Tedros stated that “there is no reason to take measures that unnecessarily interfere with international trade and travel” and that “WHO does not recommend limiting trade or movement.”
On February 5, WHO appealed to the global community for a contribution of $675 million to fund strategic preparedness in low-income countries, citing the urgency of supporting those countries “that do not have systems in place to detect people who contracted the virus, if there are any.”
Tedros also made statements in which he claimed that "we are only as strong as our weakest link" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay more in the future". On February 11, the WHO announced at a press conference that COVID-19 was the name of the disease.
On the same day, Tedros claimed that UN Secretary-General Ant<0xC3><0xB3>nio Guterres had agreed to bring the “power of the entire UN system into the response.”
As a result, a United Nations crisis management team was activated, which enabled the coordination of the United Nations-wide response, which, according to WHO, will allow them to “focus on the health response while other agencies can contribute their expertise to address the wider social, economic and development implications of the outbreak.”
On 14 February, a joint WHO-led mission team with China was activated to provide international and WHO experts on the ground in China to assist in national management and to assess "the severity and transmissibility of the disease" through the organization of workshops and meetings with key institutions at the national level and to conduct field visits.
In response to a developing outbreak in Iran, WHO sent a joint mission team there to assess the situation.On 28 February, WHO officials said that the assessment of the coronavirus threat globally would rise from “high” to “very high”, its highest level of alert and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO’s health emergencies programme, warned in a statement that “This is a reality check for all governments on the planet: Wake up.
This virus may be on its way and we must be prepared,” insisting that the right response measures could help the world avoid “the worst.”
Ryan also said the current data did not guarantee that public health officials would declare a global pandemic, noting that such a declaration would mean that “we are basically accepting that all humans on the planet will be exposed to that virus.”
On 11 March, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.
The Director-General said WHO was “very concerned, both by the alarming levels of spread and severity, and by the alarming levels of inaction.” WHO has received significant criticism for what is considered inadequate management of the pandemic, including the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
The backlash included the request for the resignation of WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, signed by 733,000 people as of 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of United Nations human rights experts stressed that the rights of all people are respected during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group indicated that everyone has the right to life-saving interventions and that the Government has this responsibility.
The group stressed that the lack of resources or health insurance should never be used as a justification for discrimination against a specific group.
The experts stressed that all people have the right to health, including persons with disabilities, those belonging to minority groups, the elderly, internally displaced persons, the homeless, those living in extreme poverty, persons in detention, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups in need of government support.
International governmental organizations are addressing the social and economic impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development launched a platform to provide comprehensive and timely information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as views and advice.
From policies to strengthen health systems and the global economy to addressing the effects of confinement and travel restrictions, the digital hub includes a country-by-country policy tracker to help countries learn from each other and facilitate a coordinated global response to the coronavirus challenge.
China’s government has been criticized by the United States, UK Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove, and the son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro, for his handling of the pandemic, which began in China’s Hubei province.
Several provincial-level administrators of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) were fired due to their handling of quarantine efforts in central China, a sign of discontent with the political system’s response to the outbreak in those regions.
Some commentators believe this move was taken to protect Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping from public anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, for example, Zhao Lijian, dismissed an earlier acknowledgement of the start of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, in favor of conspiracy theories about the origin of COVID-19 in the US or Italy.
The U.S. administration of Donald Trump has referred to the coronavirus as the “Chinese virus” or the “Wuhan virus,” and claimed that China’s “censorship overfed a virus that has now become a global pandemic,” which, in turn, was singled out by some critics as racism and “distracting from his administration’s failure to contain the disease.”
The Daily Beast obtained a cable from the U.S. Government that described a communications ploy with apparent origins in the National Security Council, and cited the strategy as "All about China."
We have been told to try to convey this message in any possible way, including press conferences and television appearances. "Media outlets such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have claimed that China's efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus are part of propaganda to gain global influence.
The European Union’s foreign policy representative, Josep Borrell, warned that “there is a geopolitical component that includes a struggle for influence through propaganda and the politics of generosity.”
Borrell also said that “China is aggressively pushing the message that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner.”
China has also called for the United States to lift its sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while reportedly sending aid to the latter two countries.
On April 3, U.S. sanctions blocked Jack Ma’s donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba.
The US authorities were also accused of diverting aid to other countries to their own country.
And there have been reported disputes related to masks between other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland; and between the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey seized hundreds of respirators destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the lack of solidarity of the European Union with Italy, affected by the coronavirus.
Maurizio Massari, Italy’s ambassador to the European Union, said: “Only China responded bilaterally.
This is certainly not a good sign of European solidarity."
On March 22, after a phone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the Russian military to send military medics, special disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa cited an anonymous "high-level political source" who claimed that 80% of Russia's aid was "useless or of little use to Italy".
The source accused Russia of engaging in an offensive of “geopolitical and diplomatic” seduction.
The President of Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, and the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Luigi Di Maio, dismissed the journalistic reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical aid to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that "by offering help to American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when American manufacturers of medical materials and equipment gain momentum, they will also be able to reciprocate if necessary."
NATO’s planned military exercise “Defend 2020” in Germany, Poland and the Baltic States, NATO’s largest war exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be held on a reduced scale.
The Secretary General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Kate Hudson, criticized the Defender 2020 exercise: "In the current public health crisis, it endangers the lives not only of the troops of the United States and the various European countries involved, but also those of the inhabitants of the countries in which they operate."
On March 14, 2020, Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders to ask for help, saying that his country is struggling to combat the outbreak due to the lack of access to international markets as a result of U.S. sanctions against Iran.The outbreak prompted the demand for the U.S. to adopt more common social policies in other rich countries, such as universal health care, universal child care, family leave.
Political analysts anticipated that it may negatively affect Donald Trump’s chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea worsened due to the pandemic.
South Korea criticized Japan's "ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts" after Japan announced that anyone from South Korea would be quarantined for two weeks at government-designated sites.
South Korean society was initially polarized about Moon Jae-in’s response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions demanding Moon's removal for what they saw as mishandling the outbreak by the government, or to praise his response.The pandemic has allowed countries to pass emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators have expressed concern that it could allow governments to strengthen their control of power.
In Hungary, his parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by decree indefinitely, suspend parliament and elections and sanction those deemed to have spread false information about the virus and the government’s handling of the crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak was blamed for several cases of supply shortages, as a result of the increased global use of equipment to combat outbreaks, panic-driven purchases and disruptions to logistics and factory operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about shortages of drugs and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and supplier disruption.
Several localities also witnessed panic-driven purchases that left shelves empty of essentials such as food, toilet paper and bottled water, leading to shortages of supplies.
The technology sector, in particular, has been warning about delays in shipments of electronic products.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100-fold.
This demand generated an increase in prices of up to twenty times the normal price and also caused delays of four to six months in the supply of medical items.
It also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment around the world, and WHO warned that this would put health workers at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for daigou buyers to sell Australian products in China.
The activity has created a shortage of baby formula in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian Government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the subsequent demand for food products, none of these areas was affected by acute food shortages.
Measures by China and Italy against the accumulation and illicit trade of essential products have been successful, preventing an acute food shortage that was anticipated in Europe and North America.
Northern Italy, with its important agricultural production, has not seen a significant reduction, but prices could rise, according to representatives of the sector.
The food shelves were only temporarily empty, even in the city of Wuhan, while Chinese government officials released pork reserves to ensure sufficient food for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy that require food producers to maintain reserves for these emergencies.
Damage to the global economy was felt in China: According to a March 16 news report, China’s economy was hit hard in the first two months of 2020 due to measures taken by the government to stop the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5%.
Since mainland China is a major economic and manufacturing center, the viral outbreak has been considered a significant destabilizing threat to the world economy.
Agathe Demarais of The Economist Intelligence Unit has predicted that markets will remain volatile until a clearer picture emerges of the potential consequences.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic consequences of the epidemic on global growth could exceed those of the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak.
An estimate by an expert at the University of Washington in St. Louis indicated an impact of more than $300 billion on the world’s supply chains that could last up to two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) was reportedly “upended” after a sharp drop in oil prices due to lower demand from China.
On February 24, global stock markets fell due to a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
On Feb. 27, due to growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, several U.S. stock indexes, including the NASDAQ-100, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average posted their steepest declines since 2008, the Dow fell 1,191 points, the biggest one-day drop since the 2007–08 financial crisis.
All three indexes ended the week with declines of more than 10%.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH affirmed China’s sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative outlook.
Stocks fell again on fears of the coronavirus, with the biggest drop occurring on March 16.
Many believe that there is likely to be an economic recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised timely emergency measures by states and central banks.
Central banks are reacting faster than they reacted to the 2008 financial collapse.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to travel bans, the closure of public places that include travel attractions and the recommendation of governments not to travel anywhere in the world.
As a result, numerous airlines have cancelled flights due to lower demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, while British regional airline Flybe collapsed.
The impact on the cruise industry has reached a level never seen before.
Several railway stations and ferry terminals have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chunyun, an important travel season related to the Chinese New Year holidays.
Several events involving large crowds were canceled by national and regional governments, including New Year’s festivals, while private companies also independently closed their stores and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many Lunar New Year events and tourist attractions have been shut down to avoid mass gatherings, including Beijing’s Forbidden City and traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of China’s 31 provinces, municipalities and regions, authorities extended the New Year holiday until February 10, and ordered most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions account for 80% of GDP and 90% of the country's exports.
Hong Kong raised its level of response to the infectious disease to the highest and declared an emergency, closed schools until March and canceled its New Year celebrations. The retail sector was affected globally, with reductions in opening hours or temporary closures.
Retail visits in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East experienced a 50 to 60 percent drop.
This also caused a 33-43% drop in pedestrian traffic to shopping malls in March compared to February.
Operators of shopping malls around the world have imposed additional measures, such as increased hygiene, installation of thermal scanners to monitor the temperature of buyers and cancellation of events.According to an estimate by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession induced by the pandemic could leave between 14 and 22 million more people in a situation of extreme poverty in Latin America than would have been left in that situation without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the epidemic in Wuhan, around 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China’s nearly 300 million rural migrant workers were stranded at home in inland provinces or trapped in Hubei Province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government aid.
The coronavirus outbreak could cost 47 million jobs in the U.S. and the unemployment rate can reach 32%, according to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Confinement in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (who receive daily wages) unemployed. According to the survey of the Angus Reid Institute, 44% of Canadian households experienced some kind of unemployment in 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit plan. Almost half a million companies in Germany have implemented short-term government-subsidized work schemes, known as Kurzarbeit, for their workers.
The German short-term workers’ compensation scheme has been adopted by France and Britain.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors were deeply affected by the pandemic, impacting the operations of organizations and people, both employed and self-employed, around the world.
Culture and arts organizations sought to carry out their mission (often publicly funded) to provide the community with access to cultural heritage, to maintain the safety of their employees and the public, and to support artists where possible.
By March 2020, worldwide and to varying degrees, museums, libraries, performance venues and other cultural institutions had closed indefinitely, and their exhibitions, events and shows were cancelled or postponed.
In response, great efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and rapidly increasing consequence of the disease is the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The Vatican announced the cancellation of the Holy Week celebrations in Rome, which take place during the last week of the season of Christian penance of Lent.
Many dioceses have recommended that older Christians stay in their homes rather than attend Mass on Sundays; some churches offered religious services via radio, live Internet broadcast or television, while others offer spaces to pray from the car.
Following the decision of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome to close its churches and chapels and with St. Peter's Square empty of Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also canceled their services and limited public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
Iran’s health ministry announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the areas affected by the outbreak and then sanctuaries were closed, while Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims and their residents from entering holy sites in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most significant disruption to the global sports calendar since World War II.
Most major sporting events were cancelled or postponed, including the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019–20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019–20 NBA season, and the 2019–20 NHL season.
The outbreak disrupted plans for the 2020 Olympic Games, which were originally scheduled to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would "be rescheduled for a later date than 2020 but not after the summer of 2021".
This caused many bettors to turn to the Internet, many online gambling sites reported significant increases in their rates of new registrations. The entertainment industry was also affected, several music groups suspended or canceled concert tours.
Many large theaters, such as those on Broadway, also suspended all shows.
Some artists have explored ways to continue producing and sharing their work over the Internet as an alternative to traditional live performances, such as live broadcasts of concerts or the creation of "festivals" on the Internet for artists to perform, distribute or publish their work.
Online, numerous Internet memes about the coronavirus were disseminated, as many resort to humor and distraction in the midst of uncertainty.
Since the COVID-19 outbreak, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia and racism towards people of Chinese and East Asian descent, and towards people from areas of Europe, the United States and other countries where the situation is critical.
Incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports from February (when most cases were still confined to China) have documented racist sentiments in various groups around the world expressing that the Chinese deserved the virus or were receiving what they considered a just retaliation.
Some countries in Africa have also seen an increase in antiquated sentiments.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination on the basis of their regional origin.
The Chinese and those in the areas affected by the virus have received support, both online and offline.
Following the advance of the outbreak into new countries where the situation is critical, people in Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a severe COVID-19 outbreak, could also be the subject of suspicion and xenophobia.Citizens from countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions to achieve a ban on Chinese entry into their countries in an effort to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan was trending on Twitter.
The Chinese, in addition to other Asian people in the United Kingdom and the United States, have reported higher levels of racist slurs, in addition to assaults.
U.S. President Donald Trump was criticized for referring to the coronavirus as the “Chinese virus,” a term many critics considered racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainian and foreign evacuees from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from northeastern India, which shares a border with China, and who study in major Indian cities were reportedly harassed in connection with the coronavirus outbreak.
Dilip Ghosh, president of the Bharatiya Janata party state unit in West Bengal, said the Chinese had destroyed nature and “that’s why God took revenge on them.”
China’s consulate in Kolkata later condemned the comments as “wrong.” In China, xenophobia and racism toward non-Chinese residents increased as a result of the pandemic, and foreigners were described as “foreign garbage” and destined for “disposal.”
Many newspapers with paywalls removed them for parts or all of their coronavirus coverage.
Many scientific editors published scientific articles related to the outbreak available with open access.
Some scientists chose to share their results quickly on prepress servers like bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing for coronavirus 2019 respiratory disease (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods that detect the presence of the virus and those that detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of virus in the samples is confirmed through the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test, which detects coronavirus RNA.
This test is specific and is designed to detect only SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and population surveillance.
Antibody tests show how many people have had the disease, including those who had symptoms too mild to report or who were asymptomatic.
From the results of this test, an accurate mortality rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity in the population can be determined.
Due to limited evidence, as of March 2020, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there are large variations in the number of tests performed in individual countries.
It is also likely that this variability is significantly affecting reported case fatality rates, which are likely to be greatly overestimated in some countries.
Through polymerase chain reaction with real-time reverse transcriptase (rRT-PCR), the test can be done on respiratory samples obtained through various methods, including nasopharyngeal swabs or sputum samples.
The results are usually available within a few hours up to 2 days.
The reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test performed with pharyngeal swabs is only reliable in the first week of disease.
Subsequently, the virus can disappear in the throat, but it continues to multiply in the lungs.
In infected people who are tested in the second week, alternatively, the sample material can be obtained from the deep parts of the airways by suction catheter, or the material that is coughed out (sputum) can be used.
One of the first polymerase chain reaction tests was developed in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020, using the polymerase chain reaction with real-time reverse transcriptase (rRT-PCR), and formed the basis of the 250,000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
As of January 23, 2020, the UK had also developed a test. On January 28, 2020, South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on the clinical-grade polymerase chain reaction (PowerChek Coronavirus).
Look for the "E" gene shared by all betacoronaviruses and the SARS-CoV-2-specific RdRp gene. In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to obtain emergency use approval from the National Medical Products Administration of China for a public SARS-CoV-2 detection kit. Reverse Reagent-CoV-2 is a new diagnostics based on the reverse reaction of the polymerase19. In the United States, the Centers for Control and Prevention
One in three genetic tests on earlier versions of the test kits generated inconclusive results due to faulty reagents, and a jam in testing at the CDC in Atlanta; as a result, on average, fewer than 100 samples were successfully processed per day throughout February 2020.
The reliability of tests using two components was not determined until February 28, 2020, and only then were state and local laboratories allowed to begin testing.
The Food and Drug Administration approved the test under an emergency use authorization. U.S. commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the national availability of COVID-19 testing based on reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.
Similarly, on March 9, 2020, Quest Diagnostics made COVID-19 testing available nationwide.
No quantity limits were announced; specimen collection and processing must be performed in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Research Center for Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Service for Healthcare Surveillance. On March 12, 2020, it was reported that Mayo Clinic had developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that could be performed within 3.5 hours in large volume, allowing a machine to perform approximately 4128 tests.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued emergency use authorization for Abbott Laboratories for a test on Abbott’s m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued similar authorizations for Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid likewise received emergency use authorization from the FDA for a test that takes approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of the polymerase chain reaction.
As this does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Currently, there are about 18,000 of these machines in the United States and Abbott plans to increase production to 50,000 tests per day.In Taiwan, a test is being developed that uses a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of the novel coronavirus, with the hope that it can provide results within 15 to 20 minutes as well as a rapid test for influenza.
In March 2020, the review of publications concluded that "thorax x-rays have little diagnostic value in the early stages, while CT [computed tomography] results can be obtained even before the onset of symptoms."
Typical features in CT include bilateral multilobar opacities in tarnished glass with a peripheral, asymmetric, and posterior distribution.
As the disease progresses, subpleural domain, cobblestone pattern, and consolidation develop.
According to a study conducted in Wuhan, at the point of origin of the current pandemic, in which the polymerase chain reaction was compared with computed tomography, computed tomography is much more sensitive than the polymerase chain reaction, although less specific, and many of the features in the images coincide with the processes of other diseases and pneumonias.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends “not using computed tomography as a screening method or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19.” Since March 2020, the CDC recommends the polymerase chain reaction as an initial screening.
Part of the immune system’s reaction to infection is the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to detect infection in people from about 7 days after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity and in population surveillance.They can be performed in central laboratories or by tests at the point of care.
High-performance automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these analyses, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For central laboratory testing, a single peripheral blood specimen is usually used, although serial specimens may be used to track the immune response.
For point-of-care testing, a single specimen of blood is usually obtained by a skin puncture.
Unlike polymerase chain reaction methods, no extraction step is needed prior to analysis. On March 26, 2020, the FDA named 29 entities that provided notification to the agency as appropriate and thus can now distribute their antibody tests.
As of April 7, 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA under an emergency use authorization. In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received approval from Europe for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The testing capability is several hundred samples within hours and is therefore much faster than the conventional viral RNA polymerase chain reaction test.
Antibodies can usually be detected 14 days after the start of infection. In early April, the UK found that none of the antibody test kits it bought were good enough to use.
Hong Kong has created a program in which suspected patients can stay in their homes, "the emergency department gives the patient a specimen tube", the patient spits in the tube, sends it and gets a result in a short time. The British NHS announced that it is implementing a pilot program to analyze suspected cases in their homes.
Drive-through centers have helped South Korea do some of the fastest and most extensive tests of any country. In Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians said on March 2 that it had a capacity for approximately 12,000 tests per day in the outpatient setting and that 10,700 people had been tested the previous week.
Health insurance assumes the costs when the test is ordered by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has an overall capacity to do 160,000 tests per week.
As of March 19, tests using the drive-through system were being offered in several large cities.
As of March 26, 2020, the total number of tests conducted in Germany was unknown, because only positive results were reported.
A first survey of laboratories revealed that, by the natural week of 12/2020, had been analyzed in total at least 483,295 samples, up to and including the week of 12/2020, and 33,491 samples (6.9%) showed positive results for the SARS-CoV-2.
With the construction, which was supervised by BGI founder Wang Jian and took 5 days, the model showed that cases in Hubei would have been 47% higher and that the corresponding cost to face quarantine would have doubled without this capacity for testing.
After the Wuhan lab, Huo-Yan labs were immediately built in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities in China.
As of March 4, 2020, the total daily production was 50,000 tests per day. Open source multiplexed designs provided by origami analysis were implemented that allow up to 1122 patient samples to be evaluated for COVID19 using only 93 analyses. These balanced designs can be used in small laboratories without the need for liquid handling robots.
By March, shortages and insufficient quantities of reagents affected mass testing in the European Union and the U.S.
This led some authors to explore sample preparation protocols involving heating the samples to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for further testing.On March 31, it was announced that the UAE was now doing more coronavirus screening per person in its population than any other country, and was on track to increase the level of testing to cover the majority of the population.
This was achieved by combining drive-through capability and purchasing a population-level mass production lab from Group 42 and BGI (which relied on their “Huo-Yan” emergency detection labs in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory has the capacity to perform tens of thousands of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction tests per day and is the first in the world of this magnitude to operate outside of China.
Different test formulas addressing different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted the German formula for making kits that it sent to low-income countries that did not have the resources to develop their own kits.
The German formula was published on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was not available until January 28, which delayed tests available in the United States. China and the United States had problems with the reliability of test kits early in the outbreak, and these countries and Australia were unable to supply enough health kits to meet the demand and recommendations of experts.
In contrast, experts say South Korea’s wide availability of tests helped slow the spread of the new coronavirus.
The Government of South Korea achieved its capacity for testing, mainly in private sector laboratories, over the course of several years.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for increased testing programs as the best way to slow the advance of the COVID-19 pandemic. High demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus caused delays of hundreds of thousands of tests in private laboratories in the U.S., and supplies of swabs and chemical reagents were depleted.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
In the United States, test kits developed by the CDC had "flaws"; the government then removed bureaucratic barriers that had prevented private testing. Spain bought test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but got inaccurate results.
The company explained that incorrect results could be due to incorrect collection of samples or incorrect use of the kits.
The Ministry of Spain said it would remove the kits that gave incorrect results and replace them with a different test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic bought from China gave incorrect results. Slovakia bought 1.2 million kits from China that turned out to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovi<0xC4><0x8D> suggested that they be thrown into the Danube. Ate<0xC5><0x9F> Kara, from the Turkish Ministry of Health, said that the test kits that Turkey bought from China had a "high error rate" and did not "put into use". The UK bought 3.5 million test kits from China, but in early April 2020, it announced that they did not serve.
Testing, supplemented by quarantine of those who tested positive and identification of contact persons who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, resulted in satisfactory results.
Researchers working in the Italian town of V<0xC3><0xB2>, the site of the first COVID-19 death in Italy, conducted two rounds of testing across the population of around 3,400, about ten days apart.
About half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms, and all cases detected were quarantined.
With the restriction of travel in the municipality, this completely eliminated new infections.
With intensive contact tracing, travel restrictions from abroad, testing and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore progressed much slower than in other developed countries, but they did not apply extreme restrictions, such as the forced closure of restaurants and retail establishments.
Many events were cancelled, and on March 28 Singapore began to recommend residents to stay in their homes, but schools reopened in time after the March 23 holiday.
Other countries have also controlled the pandemic with intensive contact tracing, restrictions on travel from abroad, testing and quarantines, but with less stringent lockdowns, such as Iceland and South Korea.
According to a statistical study, countries that have done more testing, in relation to the number of deaths, have much lower case fatality rates, probably because these countries are more able to detect people who only have mild symptoms or who have no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have testing capacity and that have national laboratories with limited experience with COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and their first ten negative samples for COVID-19 to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmatory testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the "Positive as % of tests" column is influenced by the country's testing policy.
A country that only tests on people admitted to hospitals will have a higher number of positives as a % of tests than a country that tests on all citizens, whether they manifest symptoms or not, the other issues are the same.
Hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, is the action of washing your hands in order to remove dirt, grease, microorganisms or other unwanted substances.
Constant hand washing with soap at certain "critical times" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example, diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted fecal-oral.
People can also become infected with respiratory diseases, such as the flu or the common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
The five critical times during the day when it is important to wash your hands with soap include: before and after defecation, after cleaning a child’s tail or changing diapers, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing a meal or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
If soap and water are not available, hands can be cleaned with ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing your hands:
Before, during and after preparing meals.
Before and after caring for a sick person.
After changing diapers or cleaning a child who used the bathroom.
After blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing.
After touching animals, animal feed or animal waste.
Hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Handwashing before administering medications or medical care can prevent or minimize the spread of disease.
The main medical purpose of handwashing is to remove pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause damage or disease from the hands.
This is especially important for people handling food or working in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; decreasing respiratory infections;
and reduce the infant mortality rate in home births.
A 2013 study showed that improvements in handwashing practices can lead to small improvements in height growth in children under five.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple action can reduce the death rate from these diseases by almost 50%.
Interventions that encourage handwashing can reduce diarrhea episodes by about one-third, and this is similar to providing safe drinking water in low-income areas.
48% of reductions in diarrhea episodes can be related to handwashing with soap. Handwashing with soap is the most effective and economical way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections, as automatic behavior adopted in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, a major acute respiratory disease, is the leading cause of death in children under five, claiming the lives of an estimated 1.8 million children per year.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia together account for nearly 3.5 million child deaths per year.
According to UNICEF, turning handwashing with soap before eating and after using the toilet into an ingrained habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, reducing deaths from diarrhea by almost half and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Handwashing is usually integrated with other hygiene interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programmes.
Handwashing also protects against impetigo, which is transmitted through direct physical contact.
A small detrimental effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can lead to skin damage due to dryness of the skin.
According to a 2012 Danish study, excessive hand washing can lead to an itchy skin condition that causes the skin to become scaly known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common in healthcare workers.
Too frequent hand washing is also considered one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical times during the day when handwashing with soap is important to reduce oral-fecal transmission of diseases: after using the bathroom (urinating, defecating), after cleaning a child's tail (changing diapers), before feeding a child, before eating and before/after preparing a meal or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
Other occasions when a correct handwashing technique should be practiced to prevent disease transmission include before and after treating a cut or wound; after sneezing, coughing, or blowing your nose; after touching animal waste or handling animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, there is a low rate of hand washing with soap.
A study on handwashing in 54 countries conducted in 2015 concluded that, on average, 38.7% of families practiced handwashing with soap. A study conducted in 2014 indicated that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate at 97%; the United States was close to half at 77%; and China had the lowest rate at 23%.
The “Essential Health Care Program” implemented by the Philippine Department of Education is an example of a bespoke action to promote children’s health and education.
Deworming twice a year, as well as washing your hands with soap every day, brushing your teeth daily with fluoride, are the basis of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from the skin is improved by adding soaps or detergents to the water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce barriers to solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is ineffective in cleansing the skin because fats and proteins, which are components of organic matter, do not dissolve easily in water.
However, a reasonable flow of water makes cleaning easier.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, may contain bacteria acquired in the above uses.
Some studies that looked at the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap concluded that the transfer is unlikely, as the bacteria are rinsed off with the foam.
Even so, the CDC states that “liquid soap with dispensing controls that do not involve using hands is preferable.”
Antibacterial soaps have been intensely promoted to a health-conscious public.
There is currently no evidence to show that using the recommended disinfectants or antiseptics preserve antibiotic-resistant organisms by nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of strains of resistant organisms.
In this way, even if antibacterial soaps do not preserve antibiotic-resistant strains, they may not be as effective as advertised.
In addition to the surfactant and skin-protecting agent, the sophisticated formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as well as pH regulator, benzoic acid with antimicrobial activity and more skin conditioners (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, herbal extracts).A thorough analysis of the University of Oregon's School of Public Health's anti-bacterial soaps has indicated that as common
Nice hot water to wash your hands is not enough to remove bacteria.
Bacteria grow much faster at body temperature (37°C).
However, warm soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water at removing natural oils that retain soil and bacteria.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using warm water has no effect on reducing the microbial load on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a waterless agent for hand hygiene.
In the late 1990s and early part of the 21st century, hand hygiene agents without water and with rubbing alcohol (also known as rubbing alcohol-based hand solution, rubbing antiseptic hand solution, or hand sanitizers) began to gain popularity.
Most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated with a thickening agent such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) in a gel, or a humectant such as glycerin in a liquid, or foam for easy use and to reduce the drying effect of the alcohol.
Adding diluted hydrogen peroxide further increases antimicrobial activity.Hand sanitizers containing at least 60-95% alcohol effectively kill germs.
Alcohol-based disinfectants for rubbing remove bacteria, multi-drug resistant bacteria (MRSA and ERV), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol-based rubbing sanitizers containing 70% alcohol remove 99.97% (3.5 log reduction, similar to the 35 decibel reduction) of bacteria on the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (4 to 5 log reduction) of some effective bacteria on the hands 1 minute after application.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are practically ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the most common cause of contagious gastroenteritis.Enough antiseptic or alcohol-based hand solution should be used for rubbing, such as to moisten or completely cover both hands.
The palm and back of both hands, between the fingers and the ends of all fingers are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel dries.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing before hand sanitizers for rubbing, especially when the hands are visibly dirty.
The increased use of these agents is based on their ease of use and rapid microorganism removal activity; however, they should not be used as a replacement for proper hand washing unless soap and water are not available.
Frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can dry out the skin unless emollients or skin moisturizers are added to the formula.
The drying effect of the alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollients caused considerably less skin irritation and dryness than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in alcohol-based hand rub solutions are very rare.
The lower tendency to cause irritant contact dermatitis was attractive compared to hand washing with soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, agents without water do not remove organic matter from the hands, but simply disinfect them.
For this reason, hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens, as the pathogens remain in the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers depends largely on the ingredients and the formula, in addition, historically, has been much lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based rubbing solutions.
More recently, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have been found to have a persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, the efficacy of which decreases after repeated use, probably due to progressive adverse skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities are unable to buy soap and instead use ash or soil.
Ashes or soil may be more effective than water alone, but less effective than soap.
One concern is that if soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, this can increase the spread of disease rather than decrease it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfecting agent, since, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
The WHO recommended using ash or sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.
The correct handwashing technique recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent disease transmission includes the following steps:
Wet your hands with warm or cold running water.
Running water is recommended because standing water containers can be contaminated, while the water temperature apparently makes no difference.
Rub your hands together to form lather with a generous amount of soap, including the backs of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies indicate that people often wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap than when using water alone.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
Scrubbing creates friction, which helps remove germs from the skin, and scrubbing for longer periods removes more germs.
Rinse well with running water.
Rinsing in a container can re-contaminate your hands.
Dry with a clean towel or let air dry.
Wet and wet hands re-contaminate more easily. The parts that are most often forgotten are the thumb, wrist, areas between the fingers and under the nails
Artificial nails and peeled nail polish can harbor microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotion is often recommended to prevent hands from drying out; dry skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of infection transmission.
Various economical options can be used to facilitate handwashing when running water or soap is not available, for example, pouring water from a hanging can or a pumpkin with appropriate holes or using ash if necessary in developing countries.In situations where there is a limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as "home taps" and other options.
A home tap is a simple technology that involves using a jug suspended from a rope and a foot-operated lever to pour a small amount of water over your hands and a bar soap.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some debate about the most effective form of drying in public restrooms.
More and more research is pointing out that paper towels are much more hygienic than the electric hand dryers found in many bathrooms.
In 2008, the University of Westminster, London, conducted a study, sponsored by the European Tissue Symposium paper towel industry association, to compare the hygiene levels offered by the most modern paper towels, hot air hand dryers and air jet hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with the hot air dryer, the total amount of bacteria was found to increase, on average, by 194% in the fingertips and 254% in the palms.
Drying with the air jet dryer resulted in an average increase in the total amount of bacteria of 42% in the fingertips and 15% in the palms.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total amount of bacteria decreased, on average, by 76% in the fingertips and 77% in the palms.The scientists also performed tests to determine if there was a possibility of cross-contamination of other bathroom users and the bathroom environment as a result of each type of drying method.
The air-jet dryer, which blows air from the unit at speeds reportedly of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), managed to blow microorganisms from the hands and the unit and potentially contaminate other bathroom users and the bathroom environment at a distance of up to 2 meters.
The use of a hot air hand dryer propagated the microorganisms up to 0.25 meters away from the dryer.
Paper towels did not show a significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by T<0xC3><0x9C>V Produkt und Umwelt, different hand drying methods were evaluated.
The following changes in bacteria count were observed after hand drying:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers have been compared to drying with paper towels.
Washing your hands with hand sanitizer wipes is an alternative during travel, when you do not have water or soap.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer should contain at least 60% alcohol.
The hand washing of doctors became mandatory long after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) for the prevention of diseases in a hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff members to wash their hands when they forget.
One study found a decrease in infection rates with its use.
Doctors wash their hands for at least 15 seconds, with plenty of water and soap or gel to foam and scrub all parts of the hands.
The hands should be rubbed together intertwining the fingers.
If there are remains under the nails, a bristle brush can be used to remove them.
Since germs can remain in the water on your hands, it is important to rinse them well and dry them with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the water (and open any exit doors if necessary).
This prevents the hands from becoming contaminated by these surfaces again.
The purpose of handwashing in the healthcare environment is to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and avoid transmitting them.
According to the New England Journal of Medicine, the lack of handwashing continues to exist at unacceptable levels in most medical settings, where many doctors and nurses routinely forget to wash their hands before touching patients and, in this way, transmit microorganisms.
One study showed that correct hand washing and other simple procedures can decrease the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infections by 66%.The World Health Organization has published a sheet demonstrating standard hand washing and hand rubbing in the healthcare sectors.
The preliminary version of the organization’s hand hygiene guide can also be found on its website for public comment.
Whitby and others conducted a relevant review.
Commercial devices can measure and verify hand hygiene, if demonstration of regulatory compliance is required.
The World Health Organization has “Five Moments” for hand washing:
after exposure to blood or body fluids
before aseptic work and
The addition of antiseptic chemicals in the soap ("medicinal" or "antibacterial" soaps) confers the possibility of elimination to the handwashing agent.
This removal may be necessary before surgery or in environments where antibiotic-resistant organisms are very common. To wash your hands before a surgical operation, it is necessary to have a tap that can be opened and closed without touching it with your hands, a little chlorhexidine or iodine for washing, sterilized towels to dry your hands after washing, a sterilized brush for frying.
All jewelry must be removed.
This procedure requires washing your hands and forearms up to your elbow, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
It is not necessary to wash for a long time (10 minutes).
When rinsing, water from the forearms should be prevented from returning to the hands.
After washing, the hands are dried with a sterilized cloth and a surgical gown is placed.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use a hand sanitizer before and after caring for sick people.
To control infections caused by staph in hospitals, it has been found that the greatest benefit of hand washing is in the first 20% of the wash and that very little additional benefit is obtained when the frequency of hand hygiene increases by more than 35%.
Common soap washing results in more than three times the incidence of foodborne bacterial infections compared to antibacterial soap washing.When comparing hand washing with an alcohol-based solution with hand washing with an antibacterial soap for an average time of 30 seconds in each case, it was found that rubbing with alcohol reduced bacterial contamination by 26% more than antibacterial soap.
However, water and soap are more effective at reducing the H1N1 influenza A virus and Clostridium difficile hand spores than alcohol-based hand sanitizers.Interventions to improve hand hygiene in health care facilities may include training staff on hand washing, increasing the availability of alcohol-based hand sanitizers, and written and personal reminders.
More research is needed on which of these interventions are most effective in different health care settings.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap is considered to be an economic and fundamental tool for achieving good health and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of a reliable supply of water, soap, or handwashing facilities in homes, schools, and workplaces makes achieving universal handwashing behaviors a challenge.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, there are very few hand-washing taps near public or private toilets, although there are cost-effective options for building hand-washing stations.
However, low handwashing rates can also be the result of ingrained habits and not a lack of soap or water.
Promoting handwashing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing, and cause long-term behavioral change in the population.
In order for this to work effectively, it is necessary to monitor and evaluate.
In a systematic review of 70 studies, it was noted that community-based approaches are effective in increasing handwashing in PRBMs, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. An example of promoting handwashing in schools is UNICEF’s “Three Star” approach, which encourages schools to take simple and cost-effective steps to ensure students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
When the minimum standards are reached, schools can go from one to, finally, three stars.
The construction of handwashing stations can be part of the campaigns to promote handwashing that are carried out to reduce diseases and infant mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness campaign that seeks to bring about behavioral change. As a result of the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF pushed for the creation of a handwashing emoji.
Few studies have considered the overall cost-effectiveness of handwashing in developing countries in relation to avoided DALYs.
However, one analysis indicates that promoting handwashing with soap is considerably more effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of handwashing for human health, particularly for people in vulnerable circumstances, such as mothers who have just given birth or soldiers in hospitals, was first recognized in the mid-20th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, English, the "founder of modern nursing."
At that time, most people still believed that infections were caused by unpleasant odors called miasmas.
In the 1980s, outbreaks of foodborne illness and healthcare-related infections led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote hand hygiene more actively as an important way to prevent the spread of infections.
The swine flu outbreak in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 caused many countries to become more aware of the importance of washing their hands with soap to protect themselves from these infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, posters with “correct hand-washing techniques” were hung next to the washbasins of public restrooms and the restrooms of office buildings and airports.
The phrase "washing hands" is a statement of not wanting to take charge of something or share the complicity of something.
It has its origin in the biblical passage of Matthew in which Pontius Pilate washed his hands before the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but it has become a phrase of much wider use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins compulsively washing her hands in an attempt to clean up an imaginary stain, representing her awareness of guilt over the crimes she had committed and had induced her husband to commit.
It has also been found that after remembering or reflecting on unethical actions, people tend to wash their hands more often than others and tend to value handwashing items more.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after such reflection are less likely to engage in other compensatory “cleansing” actions, such as volunteering.
Religions recommend hand washing for hygienic and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing, with water, but without soap, is part of the ritual hand washing in many religions, such as Baha'iism, Hinduism, tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, the washing of hands in Christianity and the wudu in Islam. Religions also recommend the
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam require washing hands after going to the toilet.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require washing hands before and after each meal.
Risk controls in the workplace in the face of COVID-19
The workplace risk controls against COVID-19 refer to the application of occupational health and safety methodologies in the risk controls for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Appropriate workplace risk controls depend on the workplace and job task and are based on a risk assessment of the sources of exposure, the severity of the illness in the community, and the risk factors of workers who may be prone to contracting COVID-19.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), jobs with a lower risk of exposure have minimal workplace contact with the public and co-workers, for whom basic infection prevention measures are advised, including hand washing, recommending workers stay home if they are sick, respiratory hygiene standards, and maintaining a routine cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Jobs with medium exposure risk include those requiring frequent or close contact with people who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19, but who could be infected by current community transmission or by international travel.
This includes workers who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, crowded work environments, and some large retail environments.
Risk controls for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation with high-efficiency air filters, protective covers and personal protective equipment available in case there is a person with COVID-19.
OSHA believes that health care and funeral workers, exposed to people known or suspected to have COVID-19, have a high risk of exposure, which increases to very high if they perform procedures that can generate aerosols on people known or suspected to have COVID-19 or take or handle samples from these people.
Appropriate risk controls for these workers include engineering controls, such as negative pressure ventilation rooms, and personal protective equipment appropriate for the work activity.
COVID-19 outbreaks can have several consequences in the workplace.
Workers may miss work due to illness, having to care for others, or fear of possible exposure.
Trade patterns may change, both in terms of which goods are demanded and in the means of acquiring those goods (such as buying at non-peak hours, via in-home delivery services or by car window).
Finally, shipments of items from geographical areas severely affected by COVID-19 could be disrupted. An infectious disease preparedness and response plan can be used to guide preventive measures.
The plans address risk levels related to various workplaces and work activities, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from domestic and community settings, and risk factors for individual workers, such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
They also outline the controls needed to address those risks and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of outbreaks.
Infectious disease preparedness and response plans may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
The objectives of an outbreak response include reducing transmission between staff members, protecting those at greatest risk of adverse health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community in which the company is located affects the measures that are taken.
The hierarchy of risk controls is a widely used occupational health and safety framework for classifying risk controls according to their effectiveness.
If the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls and, finally, personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve isolating employees from work-related hazards without resorting to worker behavior and may be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative controls are changes in labor policies or procedures that require action by the worker or employer.
Personal protective equipment is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but it can help prevent some exposures.
All types of personal protective equipment should be selected according to the hazard to the worker, placed as appropriate (e.g. respirators), used appropriately and systematically, checked frequently, maintained, replaced if necessary, and disposed of, cleaned and stored or disposed of correctly so as not to contaminate.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), jobs with a lower risk of exposure have minimal workplace contact with the public and co-workers.
Basic infection prevention measures that are recommended for all workplaces include deep and frequent hand washing, recommending workers to stay home if they are sick, respiratory hygiene rules that include covering themselves when coughing and sneezing, provision of paper tissues and containers for wastes, preparation for telework or staggered shifts if necessary, provision of equipment and tools for cleaning and maintenance of the work environment.
The immediate identification and isolation of people who may be infected is a critical measure to protect workers, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory illness stay in their homes until they stop having fever, signs of fever, and any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without having taken medication to relieve symptoms or lessen the fever; that sick leave policies be flexible and allow employees to stay home for at least 24 hours.
According to OSHA, jobs with average exposure risk include those requiring frequent or close contact less than six feet (1.8 m) away with people who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19, but who could have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to community-based transmission of the moment around the company location, or because the person recently made an international trip to a location with widespread COVID-19 transmission.

Workers in this risk group should rarely wear respirators.
If a person gets sick on an airplane, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include separating the sick person from others at a distance of 6 feet, appointing a crew member to care for the sick person and offering a mask to the sick person, or asking the sick person to cover his or her mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing.
Cabin crew should wear disposable surgical gloves to care for a sick passenger or to touch body fluids or possibly contaminated surfaces and, perhaps, personal protective equipment if the sick passenger has a fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in a biohazardous waste bag, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards.In the case of commercial shipping, such as cruise ships and other vessels carrying passengers, risk controls include delaying travel due to illness, self-isolation, and immediately informing the onboard medical center if anyone has a fever or other symptoms while on board.
In the case of schools and child care centers, the CDC recommends short-term closure to clean or disinfect if an infected person was in the school building, regardless of community transmission.
When community transmission is minimal or moderate, social distancing strategies can be implemented, such as canceling field trips, assemblies and other mass gatherings, such as physical or choir classes or dining room meals, increasing the space between desks, staggering entry and exit times, limiting non-essential visits, and using a separate health room location for children who have flu symptoms.
When there is considerable transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, extended cancellation of classes may be considered. For law enforcement personnel conducting routine daily activities, the CDC considers the immediate health risk to be low.
Police officers who must contact people who have a confirmed diagnosis or suspicions of COVID-19 are advised to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including the use of personal protective equipment.
If there is close contact during an arrest, workers should clean and disinfect their work belt and equipment with a household cleaning spray or wipes before reusing them and follow the standard operating procedure for containment and disposal of personal protective equipment and containment and washing of clothing.
OSHA considers certain health care workers and morgues to be within high or very high risk categories of exposure.
Among the high exposure risk jobs are those of delivery, support, laboratory and medical transport workers who are exposed to patients with confirmed diagnoses or suspected COVID-19.
These become very high-risk exposure jobs if workers perform aerosol-generating procedures on patients with confirmed diagnoses or suspected COVID-19 or if they take or manipulate samples from these patients.
Some aerosol-generating procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopies, some dental procedures and examinations, or invasive sampling.
High-risk morgue jobs include those in which workers are involved in preparing the corpses of people who had COVID-19 or were suspected of having it at the time of death; these go on to have a very high risk of exposure if they perform autopsies.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some health care settings and morgues.
Samples should be handled with Biosafety Level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be separated into different waiting rooms based on whether or not they are suspected of having COVID-19. In addition to other types of personal protective equipment, OSHA recommends the use of face masks for those people who work at a distance of up to 6 feet from those patients who have undergone aerosol-borne procedures or are suspected of having contracted SARS.
In the United States, N95 respirators with filtering masks approved by NIOSH or higher should be used in the context of a written comprehensive respiratory program that includes fitting tests, training, and medical examinations.
Other types of masks can provide greater protection and improve worker comfort.The WHO does not recommend the use of protective overalls, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, not one that is transmitted by body fluids.
The WHO only recommends the use of a surgical mask for incoming patient grading staff.
For those who take respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients, provide care or transport them without performing aerosol-generating procedures, WHO recommends the use of surgical masks, goggles or face shields, gowns and gloves.
If an aerosol-generating procedure is performed, the surgical mask should be replaced with an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Because the supply of personal protective equipment is insufficient, the WHO recommends minimizing the need to use them, replacing them with telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, the limitation of the permission to enter the room of a patient with COVID-19 only to those people involved in their direct care, the use of the same mask without removing it while providing care to several patients with the same diagnosis.

This month, we find ourselves in unique circumstances.
The COVID-19 epidemic highlights our global human interconnectedness and the responsibilities we have to one another.
The challenges it presents are unprecedented, but we know that our best response lies in the empathy, cooperation and global community building that form the core of this organization.
The camaraderie and concern we’ve seen among all of our peers in emails, calls, and conversations is a great validation of how amazing the people we’re lucky to work with are.
I could not feel more gratitude and pride that you are all my companions.
Last week, someone shared with me their appreciation for our work.
They reminded me how important it is for the world to be able to turn to Wikipedia right now and the powerful symbol that is the fact that this critical resource remains online and available to everyone.
Their work makes this possible, whether it’s keeping the sites up and running, helping our peers get paid, or keeping our communities safe.
The world needs the information that Wikipedia provides, today more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do but how we do it will have a profound effect on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and its role in it, starting this coming week, we will be making some important adjustments to the way we work together.
Adjustments to our work and schedules
As Robyn previously mentioned, Team C met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the coming days and months.
In that conversation, we considered what we thought would be an appropriate response to what we are facing and what would be the best way to maintain the sustainability of the organization at this time.
To a greater extent, we wanted to eliminate stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to slow down, that's fine.
For all staff, contractors and contract workers:
our daily work expectations will be about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week, until next notice.
We are not declaring a holiday; if you can work on a more normal schedule, this would be of great use to the mission.
However, the world is an unpredictable place these days, and whether you have to take care of your loved ones, go shopping or go to the doctor, our priority is your well-being.
We're not keeping track of their hours.
If you are sick, do not work.
Although it should not be necessary to say it, we say it.
There’s no need to ask for sick leave or paid time off; just let your manager know and help your team review schedules and schedules to make sure key areas of work are covered.
(If you receive a positive COVID-19 diagnosis, let Bryan, of T&C Operations, know so T&C can help with support and make sure management is aware of your situation.)
People who work per hour will receive full payment.
As we’ve said, we renew our commitment to our hourly contractors and co-workers.
All will be paid on the basis of their normal hours worked under normal circumstances.
This also applies if you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, you have our support.
Many people use work as a way to channel their stress with the world around us.
What we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in these times.
Again, this is about your personal care.
What we ask is that you contact your manager so that we know what to expect and can adapt properly.
Some work is considered essential.
There are a few things we need to keep doing.
The Site Reliability Engineering, Human Resources Operations, Trust and Safety and Fundraising teams, among others, perform critical work that may require additional support.
We will begin a process with all departments to assess current objectives and modify our approach to support what is essential to our mission.
There are enough tasks for all of us; the only difference is that we will all focus on the most essential projects.
Slowing down today won't hurt us tomorrow.
We do not plan to “double the hours to catch up” when the pandemic ends.
You won’t be expected to work overtime to meet deadlines that are no longer realistic.
We accept that circumstances have changed and will work to set new goals and timelines when appropriate.
What about the APP, or Annual Planning?
To adjust to our new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we plan to adjust the schedule for the delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Schedule.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan that allocates more time to the budget so that employees can prioritize critical work, self-care and caring for loved ones while adapting to the needs of those who need or want to work on a reduced schedule over the coming weeks.
This extension of our schedule greatly reduces current planning burdens and pressure across the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and communicate the next steps to delegates and teams as soon as we have confirmation.
Thank you to the APP team for their leadership in this situation.
State, exposure and cleaning of the office
Last week we learned that one of our colleagues in the San Francisco office may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, as a precautionary measure, we hired an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used a hospital-grade antiviral solution to disinfect all surfaces, in addition to the reception and elevators that go to our floor.
The building has adopted its own duty of care protocol, using products that support the safety of its occupants.
We feel confident that the office will be well prepared for when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in a WeWork, which has shared its COVID-19 protocol with us and all staff members at DC offices.
Since last week, our DC office has moved its operations to a completely remote environment in accordance with the guidelines shared with San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York City already know, we have also talked about renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions are still ongoing but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who already worked remotely before know that this modality requires an adaptation, so they provide the following suggestions:
Limit the duration of meetings to one or two hours at most.
If longer sessions are required, consider how to section them over the course of several days.
Clearly define the meeting with a list of topics and send reading materials in advance.
Adopt video usage by default, using tools like Google Docs and Zoom for easy collaboration and live connection.
Designate a leader to moderate each meeting, a person to control questions in the chat and speaker list, and someone to help take notes (or take notes collaboratively).
Send an email to technical support if you need comfortable headphones.
Use the wellness rebate for snacks.
Join #remoties on Slack to talk to colleagues about distributed work
The HR Operations team is analyzing guidelines on webinar-based ergonomics to support the increase in distributed work throughout the Foundation.
This past week we asked all community grant recipients to cancel Wikimedia-funded public events, such as edits, until the WHO declares an end to the pandemic.
We informed you that we understood that our request for cancellations and other restrictions could make it impossible for you to fulfill your part of the activities agreed for the grant and that there would be no penalty for having to delay or modify those objectives.
This coming week we will follow up with additional guidelines at Wikimania and other community and regional thematic conferences.
The overall feeling of the global community seems to be, in part, sadness at the disruption and, in part, relief at the clarity and ability to focus on their own communities, both Wikimedia and others.
Going forward, CRT will be working to establish a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and follow our communications with them.
Maintaining contact in relation to COVID-19 issues
We will send you an invitation through your calendars for next Thursday, 2:00 p.m., Coordinated Universal Time/7:00 a.m. Pacific Time, for a special staff meeting.
We will take this opportunity to share additional news, answer your questions and spend time connecting with each other.
We are in this together and we are available to help in any way we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to find the information in this email message and all the additional essential information related to COVID-19 on the Office Wiki.
CRT will keep these pages up to date and all information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communications with staff residing in countries that are currently being heavily affected.
If you have any questions about travel, events, a major workflow, a coverage issue, or anything you might need help with, feel free to notify CRT and work with them.
We are here to help provide support and function as a link when needed.
If you have sensitive or confidential matters, please email Bryan Judan, Head of Global International Operations, HR.
None of these changes should be considered an abandonment of our work and our obligations.
Instead, they are an acknowledgment that, at this point, our work and our obligations probably need to be adapted in a way that hasn’t happened before.
These are the measures we believe are necessary to support each other so that we can continue to work, give our movement the support it needs, and give the world the service it trusts.
Our planned work will still be there for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to support each other and make room for the important work that will come in the coming weeks and possibly months.
We need all of you to make this possible and, therefore, we need you to take care of yourselves and your families so that they can be in the best possible condition when the need arises.
Now, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S) and the rest of the Leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ECA2) is an enzyme that attaches to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 counteracts the activity of the related angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing angiotensin (1-7), making it a therapeutic target for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.
The human version of the enzyme is generally referred to as hECA2.
The angiotensin 2 converting enzyme is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme found on the surface of endothelial and other types of cells.
The ACE2 protein contains an N-terminal domain of M2 peptidase and a C-terminal renal amino acid transporter domain of collectrin.
ACE2 is a type I unipass membrane protein, with its enzymatically active domain exposed on the surface of lung cells and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is cleaved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as shedase, and as a result, the soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and ultimately excreted in the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached mainly to the cell membrane of type II alveolar cells of the lungs, to enterocytes of the small intestine, to arterial and venous endothelial cells and to arterial smooth muscle cells of most organs.
ACE2 mRNA expression is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
The main function of ACE2 is to counteract ACE.
ACE cleaves the angiotensin I hormone and forms angiotensin II, which is vasoconstrictor.
In turn, ACE2 cleaves the carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it to form the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also cleave several other peptides, including [de-Arg9]-bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dynorphin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates membrane trafficking of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and has been associated with Hartnup's disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the main entry point for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of the spike S1 protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the ACE2 enzyme domain on the surface of cells results in endocytosis and the transfer of the virus along with the enzyme to endosomes found within the cells.
This entry process also requires the preparation of protein S by the host's serine protease TMPRSS2, the inhibition of which is currently being investigated as a possible therapy.This has led to certain hypotheses that reducing ACE2 levels in cells could help fight infection.
However, various professional associations and regulators have recommended continuing ACE inhibitor therapy and standard ARBs.
A review with systematic meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 determined that “the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to control cases.”
The risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients who received treatment with ACE inhibitors and who had an increased risk of pneumonia, particularly those with stroke and heart failure.
“The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were not as robust for the overall risk of pneumonia.”
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhECA2) appears to be a novel therapy for acute lung injury and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhECA2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes in addition to the course of effect (duration) of 24 hours.
Several findings suggest that rhECA2 could be a promising drug for those with intolerance to classical renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases in which circulating angiotensin II is elevated.rhECA2 infusion was evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
COVID-19 applications are mobile software applications designed to help with contact tracing in response to the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying people (“contacts”) who might have been in contact with an infected person.
Various applications were developed or proposed with official government support in some territories and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks have been developed for the creation of contact tracing applications.
Concerns have been raised regarding privacy, in particular, in relation to systems that rely on tracking the geographic location of application users.
There are other less invasive alternatives, such as using Bluetooth signals to record a user’s proximity to other cell phones.
On April 10, 2020, Apple and Google jointly announced that they would integrate the functionality to support such Bluetooth-based applications directly into their iOS and Android operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, along with Alipay, has implemented an app that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with people who have COVID-19.
It is already in use in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore an app called TraceTogether is being used.
The application was developed by a local IT community, launched as an open source application and will be handed over to the government. In North Macedonia, "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth-based application was launched to track exposure to potentially infected people and provide a quick response to health authorities.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government reported that the contact tracing app was at an advanced stage of development and would be available for implementation in the coming weeks. A similar app is planned to be used in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on the TraceTogether app and Singapore’s BlueTrace protocol. Russia plans to introduce a geo-scanning app for patients living in Moscow who have been diagnosed with COVID-19, designed to ensure they don’t leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Security Engineering at the University of Cambridge, exposed several potential practical problems with application-based systems, including false positives and the possible lack of effectiveness if application adoption is limited to only a small portion of the population.
In response to concerns about the spread of deceptive or harmful “coronavirus” apps, Apple limited the types of organizations that can add coronavirus-related apps on its App Store to “official” or trusted organizations only.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates expressed concern about the consequences of mass surveillance through coronavirus applications and, in particular, whether the infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be dismantled once the threat passes.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organisations have issued a statement demanding limits on such surveillance.
The organizations set eight conditions for government projects:
surveillance would have to be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
expansions of monitoring and surveillance would have to have sunset clauses;
the use of the data would have to be limited to COVID-19-related objectives;
security and anonymity should be protected and there should be evidence of such protection;
digital surveillance should avoid exacerbating discrimination and marginalisation;
any exchange of data with third parties should be defined in the laws;
protections against abuse should be implemented and the rights of citizens to respond to such abuse established;
The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen, RSF) of Germany also published lists of controls.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to address the problem of persistent surveillance by removing the tracking mechanism from its operating systems when it is no longer needed.
In some countries, network-based location tracking was used instead of apps, eliminating both the need to download an app and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data present significant potential privacy issues.
However, not all systems with central servers need to have access to personal location data; several privacy protection systems have been created that use central servers only for intercommunication (see next section).
In South Korea, a non-application-based system was used to conduct contact tracing.
Instead of using a specific application, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and credit card transaction data, and combined them to generate text message alerts for potentially infected people.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government has also made location information available to the public, which is allowed due to far-reaching changes to information privacy laws following the MERS outbreak in that country.
This information is available to the public through various applications and websites. Some countries, including Germany, considered using centralized and privacy protection systems.
As of April 6, 2020, details have not yet been released.
Privacy-protected contact tracing is a well-established concept, with a wealth of published research going back at least to 2013. As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using low-energy Bluetooth (BLE) to record a user’s proximity to other cell phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that contains both centralized and decentralized approaches and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized proximity tracking to preserve privacy (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, formerly known as contact event numbers, CEN), and other protocols and mechanisms for mobile contact tracking for privacy protection (ACT).
In these protocols, personally identifiable data never leaves the device and all pairing occurs on the device.
The MIT Media Lab Privacy Group has been developing SafePaths, a platform for using privacy-protecting techniques when collecting and using location or route intersection data to track the spread of COVID-19.
It builds on research from the technical report “Out of Control Applications: How to Maintain Personal Privacy During an Epidemic,” published in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform from Enigma MPC, a company that develops privacy technologies that was also originally founded at the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies that allow its users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials, without compromising the privacy of that data.
On April 5, 2020, several groups united around what was essentially the same approach and with highly matching protocols formed the Global TCN Coalition with the goal of reducing fragmentation and enabling global interoperability of tracking and alerting applications, a key aspect of achieving widespread adoption.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had opened up the BlueTrace protocol code used by its official government application.
On April 10, 2020, Apple and Google, the companies that control the iOS and Android mobile platforms, announced a contact-tracking initiative that they said would protect privacy, which is based on the combination of low-energy Bluetooth technology and privacy-protecting cryptography.
They also published the specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be implemented in three stages:
implementation of tools for governments to create official privacy-protecting coronavirus tracking applications
Google and Apple plan to address adoption and persistent surveillance issues by first distributing the system through operating system updates and then removing them in the same way once the threat has passed.
Reprofiling (also known as repositioning or therapeutic switching) is the readaptation of a drug approved for the treatment of a disease other than that for which it was originally developed.
This is in line with scientific research currently seeking to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other lines of research include the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 and convalescent plasma transfusion. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 chemomodulable proteins, each of which has multiple ligand binding sites.
The analysis of these binding sites provides a reasonable basis for the project to develop an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are papain-like protease, RNA-directed RNA polymerase, helicase, protein S, and ribophosphatase ADP.
Hussein A. A. et al. studied several compounds of medical interest that they then optimized and analyzed to identify the similarity of their main chain with the most similar approved drugs in order to accelerate the development of a potent drug against SARS-CoV-2 in their preclinical study and recommend it for the design of a clinical study.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs to be studied in the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York State trials with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate through an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA’s clinical trial process and is licensed under a U.S.A. only as an experimental treatment for urgent use in patients who are hospitalized but unable to receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC said that "the use, dose, or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" is not yet established.
Doctors have said they use the drug when "there is no other option."
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
At Duke University and Oxford University, large studies are underway.
NYU Langone School of Medicine is conducting a trial on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed to show that favipiravir was “clearly effective.”
Thirty-five patients in Shenzhen tested negative in an average of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study in Wuhan of 240 patients with pneumonia, half received favipiravir, while the other half received umifenovir.
The Italian Medicines Agency reminded the public that existing evidence supporting the drug is scarce and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced it would buy the drug from Japan for its reserves and turn to the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals, where it will be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has made proposals to the Trump administration on buying the drug, which may be less effective in severe cases of the disease if the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for women who are pregnant or trying to conceive.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of the antivirals lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that “no benefits were observed”.
The drugs were designed to inhibit HIV replication by binding to the protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drugs to find a compound that binds to the SARS-CoV-2 protease.In the scientific community, criticism has arisen about the allocation of resources to the readaptation of drugs specifically developed for HIV/AIDS.
The WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international trial Solidarity.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections.Gilead Sciences subsequently discovered that remdesivir had in vitro antiviral activity against multiple filoviruses, pneumoviruses, paramyxoviruses, and coronaviruses.
One problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can result in more severe disease and transmission.
Several clinical trials are ongoing, including two led by Cleveland University hospitals; one for people with a moderate illness and one for those with a more serious illness.
Three intravenous vitamin C clinical trials are ongoing for people hospitalized and severely affected by COVID-19; two placebo-controlled (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
New York State began trials with the antibiotic azithromycin on March 24, 2020.
Japan’s National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning a clinical trial with Teijin’s Alvesco (ciclesonide), an inhaled corticosteroid for asthma, as a treatment for asymptomatic patients infected with the novel coronavirus.
A form of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, a phase II trial is ongoing and 200 critically ill patients hospitalized in Denmark, Germany and Austria will be enrolled to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in decreasing lung inflammation and complications in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called COLCORONA, is enrolling 6,000 adults aged 40 and older with a diagnosis of COVID-19 and mild symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or do not have an affective contraceptive method are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being evaluated in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, so the Italian Medicines Agency published guidelines on its use.
On April 14, a multicenter study with 300 patients investigating the use of enoxaparin sodium in preventive and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy.
As SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, scientists are devoting much attention to the readaptation of antiviral drugs that were developed for previous outbreaks of the MERS, SARG and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Here are some treatments that were identified for possible readaptations for the treatment of COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (blocks the IL-6 receptor): approved by China.
<0x7B>NS<0x7D>
b'A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical coronavirus vaccine 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, there are many ongoing attempts to develop such a vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect there to be a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease, in less than 18 months.
As of April, five potential vaccines were in Phase I safety studies.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread around the world in 2020, triggering considerable investment and research activity to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use the published genomes to develop potential SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.
Established in April, CEPI’s initiative requirements for vaccine development are speed, manufacturing capacity, scaled-up implementation and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were being researched and developed in early 2020 to create an effective COVID-19 vaccine.
Targets for major platforms that moved on to Phase I security studies include:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (developer of phase I and possible vaccine: Modern, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (developer of phase I and possible vaccine: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus vector type 5)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 potential vaccines are in the early stages of development, 78 of which are confirmed in active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute) and the other 37 are announced, but with little information available (presumably being planned or developed).
A phase I or II trial performs preliminary tests of safety and immunogenicity, is usually randomized, placebo-controlled, and multi-sited, while determining more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III trials typically involve more participants, including a control group, and evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent disease, while controlling for adverse effects that occur with the optimal dose.
Of the 79 vaccines in active development (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 were not yet being evaluated in humans (following on from “preclinical” research).
Around January 24, 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was investigating the potential of a molecularly-bound vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate the immune reaction.
Around January 24, 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced the start of work on a vaccine and expects human testing to begin in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention on January 26, 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on January 28.
Around January 29, 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that they had begun developing a vaccine.
Janssen is co-developing an oral vaccine with his biotech associate, Vaxart.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart for the development of the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a document with a design for a vaccine with technology similar to that used in the treatment with neoantigenic cancer vaccines.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced that they had completed the synthesis of the vaccine and that tests were beginning.
On February 27, 2020, a Generex subsidiary, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that it was beginning a project to create a li-key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a possible vaccine that could be tested in humans “within 90 days.”
On March 5, 2020, the University of Washington in St. Louis announced its plans to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command at Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Silver Spring, both in western Maryland, announced that they were working on a vaccine.
Around March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it had joined Novavax Inc.
in the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
The partners also announced plans for a clinical trial and a phase I clinical trial by July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, India’s Ministry of Health announced that it was working with 11 isolates and that, while progressing rapidly, it would take at least a year and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported the development of a coronavirus-like particle with partial funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
The potential vaccine is in the laboratory research stage and human testing is expected to begin in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that U.S. President Donald Trump had offered CureVac "'large amounts of money for exclusive access to a COVID-19 vaccine,'" to which the German government complained.
On March 17, 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop an mRNA-based vaccine.
The potential BNT162 mRNA-based vaccine is currently in preclinical trials and clinical trials are expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy, on March 17, 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it will have the results of preclinical tests in April 2020 and that human trials of the final possible vaccine could begin in the fall.
In France, on March 19, 2020, the Coalition for Innovations in Epidemic Preparedness (CEPI) announced an investment of USD 4.9 million in a COVID-19 vaccine research alliance that includes Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing the total CEPI investment for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine to USD 29 million.
The other CEPI partners for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford and the University of Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists began animal testing of six possible vaccines.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on March 20, 2020 that they were developing a self-replicating RNA vaccine against COVID-19.
The potential vaccine was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequence from China.
At the end of March, the Canadian government announced funding of CAD 275 million for 96 research projects on medical measures to counter COVID-19, including a large number of potential vaccines at Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago and University of Saskatchewan initiatives.
At about the same time, the Canadian government announced the use of CAD 192 million specifically to develop a vaccine against COVID-19, with plans to create a “national vaccine bank” with several new vaccines that could be used if another coronavirus outbreak occurs.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine announced the testing of PittCoVacc, a possible COVID-19 vaccine, in mice and said that “MNA-administered SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccines elicited potent responses of antigen-specific antibodies (in mice) that were evident two weeks after vaccination.”
In Canada, on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo’s Faculty of Pharmacy announced the design of a possible DNA-based vaccine as a probable nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be designed to replicate within human bacteria and produce harmless virus-like particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry, and three U.S. universities pooled resources to access IBM supercomputers, along with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have non-specific effects.
That means they may have benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Another randomized trial in Australia seeks to enroll 4,170 health workers.
Vaccines that are being developed may not be safe or effective.
Initial research to evaluate the efficacy of vaccines with COVID-19-specific animal models, such as the ACE2-expressing transgenic mouse, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, highlights the need for level 3 biosecurity containment measures for the manipulation of live viruses and with international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SRAG and SROM have been tested in non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no cure or vaccine that protects against SARS that has been shown to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research publications from 2005 to 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies worldwide. Nor is there a confirmed vaccine against MRSD.
When MERS became widespread, it was believed that existing research on SARS could be a useful template for developing vaccines and treatments against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, one (DNA-based) SROM vaccine has completed Phase I human clinical trials, three others were in progress, all of which are viral vector vaccines, two adenoviral vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts promoted a conspiracy theory that the virus causing COVID-19 was known and there was already a vaccine.
The patents cited by various social media publications refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronavirus strains, such as the SARS coronavirus.
b'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms are fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
The time that elapses between exposure and the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but can vary between two and fourteen days.
While most cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to viral pneumonia and multi-organ failure.
As of April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, with more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered.The virus spreads mainly between people during close contact, usually through droplets that occur when coughing, sneezing, or talking.
While these droplets occur upon exhalation, they usually fall to the floor or surfaces, rather than being contagious over long distances.
People can also become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although spread is also possible before symptoms appear and in late stages of the disease.The standard method for diagnosis is the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of a nasopharyngeal swab.
Masks are recommended for those who suspect they have the virus and their caregivers.
Recommendations on the use of masks for the general public vary; some authorities recommend that they should not be used, others recommend that they should be used, while others require their use.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been reported in most countries in the six WHO regions.
Those who are infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or have flu-like symptoms, such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include shortness of breath, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty walking, and bluish face or lips. If these symptoms occur, immediate medical attention is recommended.
It is less common to see symptoms in the upper respiratory tract, such as sneezing, runny nose, and sore throat.
Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, have been identified in varying percentages.
Some cases in China initially presented chest tightness and palpitations.
In some, the disease progressed to pneumonia, multi-organ failure, and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
97.5% of people who have symptoms do so within 11.5 days of infection. Not all infected people are reported to have symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers is not yet fully known; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20 percent of confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during hospitalization, and the proportion of people infected with no symptoms remained asymptomatic during hospitalization.
China’s National Health Commission began including asymptomatic cases in daily cases on April 1, and of the 166 infections on that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic when tested.
Both sputum and saliva can have high viral loads.
Speaking out loud releases more droplets than when speaking at a normal volume.
A study in Singapore found that not covering your mouth when coughing can cause droplets to travel 15 feet (4.5 meters).
Although the virus is not usually airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that transmission by biological aerosols is possible and explained that air collectors in the hallway outside people's bedrooms tested positive for viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can cause aerosolization of respiratory secretions and, consequently, airborne transmission.
While there are concerns about the possibility of it spreading through the stool, the risk is believed to be low.The virus is most contagious when people have symptoms; although spread is possible before the onset of symptoms, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) explains that, although the ease with which it spreads is not entirely clear, a person usually infects two or three more. The virus survives for hours or days on surfaces.
Specifically, the virus was detected for one day in cardboard, up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours in products with 99% copper.
However, this varies according to humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergent are also effective if used the right way.Soap products degrade the protective lipid layer of the virus and deactivate it, as well as remove it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorohexidine glucanate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective.In a Hong Kong study, saliva samples were taken on average two days after the start of hospitalization.
In five of six patients, the first sample had the highest viral load; in the case of the sixth patient, the highest viral load was observed on the second day of testing.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to a cluster of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
All the features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in coronaviruses of a related nature.
Outside the human body, household soap kills the virus by bursting its protective bubble. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19, because the virus enters host cells through the angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2 (ECA2), which is most abundant in type II alveolar cells in the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a spicule (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
In 12% of infected people hospitalized in Wuhan, China, acute heart injury was identified, which is more common in severe disease.
Rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high, due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, but acute myocardial injury may be related to receptor ACE2s in the heart.
Receptor ACE2s have a high expression in the heart and are involved in its functioning.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was detected in ICU patients with COVID-19 virus infections and may be related to poor prognosis.In autopsies of people who died from COVID-19, diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrates with lymphocytes in the lungs were detected.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropism for airway ACE2-expressing epithelial cells, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting T cells were observed to correlate with recruitment of IL-6-secreting monocytes and severe pulmonary pathology in COVID-19 patients.
In autopsies, lymphocytic infiltrates were also reported.
The WHO has published several test protocols to detect the disease.
The standard test method is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually done on airway samples obtained from a nasopharyngeal swab; however, nasal swab or sputum samples may also be used.
Results are usually available within a few hours or two days.
Blood tests may also be used, but two blood samples should be taken two weeks apart and the results have very little immediate value.
The Chinese scientists managed to isolate the coronavirus strain and published the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection by the virus.
As of April 4, 2020, antibody tests (which can detect active infections and whether the person was infected in the past) were being developed, but were not widely used.
Experience in China with testing has shown that the accuracy is only 60-70%.
The FDA in the United States approved the first immediate diagnostic test on March 21, 2020 for use later that month. Diagnostic guidelines published by Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital suggested methods for detecting infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral multilobular frosted glass opacities with a peripheral, asymmetric, and posterior distribution are common in the initial stages of infection.
As the disease progresses, subpleural domain, disordered cobblestone pattern (lobular septal thickening with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation may appear.
Few data are available on microscopic lesions and the pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological results of autopsies are as follows:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary edema
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, atypically large pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration, and giant cell formation with multiple nuclei
Severe pneumonia: Diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD causes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
pneumonia in healing: organization of exudates in alveolar cavities and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to decrease the chances of infection include staying at home, avoiding places with many people, washing your hands with soap and water frequently for at least 20 seconds, having good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching your eyes, nose, or mouth without washing your hands.
The CDC recommends covering your mouth and nose with a handkerchief when coughing or sneezing and, if you don’t have handkerchiefs, using the inside of your elbow.
Proper hand hygiene is recommended after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC has recommended the use of cloth caps in public places, one of the reasons is to limit transmission by asymptomatic people. Social distancing strategies seek to reduce the contact of infected people with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and canceling mass public meetings.
Distance guidelines also state that people should maintain a distance of 6 feet (1.8 m).
There is no effective medicine to prevent COVID-19. As there is not expected to be a vaccine until 2021 at the earliest, a key part of controlling COVID-19 is to try to prevent the epidemic peak, which is known as "flattening the curve".
The CDC also recommends washing your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, particularly after going to the bathroom or when your hands are visibly dirty, before eating, and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
They also recommend using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that has a minimum of 60% alcohol, but only when there is no water and soap available in a timely manner. For areas where hand sanitizers are not easy to get, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, the antimicrobial activity results from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help remove bacterial spores in alcohol; "it is not an active substance for antisepsis of the hands."
Glycerol is added as a humectant.
Patients are provided with supportive care, which may include rehydration, oxygen therapy, and treatment for other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends that those suspected of having the virus wear a simple mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address the problem of respiratory failure, but the benefits are still being analyzed.
To improve immunity, personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet have been recommended.
Supportive treatments may be useful for those with mild symptoms in the initial stage of infection.The WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for the care of people hospitalized with COVID-19.
Intensivists and pulmonologists in the U.S. compiled recommendations from various agencies into a free resource, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For the initial treatment of symptoms, some medical professionals recommend paretamol (acetaminophen), rather than ibuprofen.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in health care settings when performing procedures that can generate aerosols, such as intubation or manual ventilation.
CDC recommends that health care professionals who care for people with COVID-19 place the patient in an air infection isolation zone (AIIR), in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions, and precautions to prevent airborne transmission.CDC highlights guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
Recommended equipment is an PPE gown, mask, goggles, and medical gloves. When available, respirators (rather than masks) are preferred.
N95 masks are approved for industrial environments, but the FDA authorized their use through an urgent use authorization (U.S.).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles, such as dust, but are not guaranteed to be effective against a specific biological agent that is not stipulated in the product indications.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of protective masks or, as a last resort, homemade masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not serious enough to require mechanical ventilation or alternatives, but a percentage of cases are.
This type of respiratory support is being actively studied for hospitalized people with COVID-19-related respiratory failure and there is already some evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high-flow nasal cannula or positive bipressure in the airways.
It is not yet known whether either of these two provide the same benefit to people in critical condition.
Some doctors prefer to use invasive mechanical ventilation when it is available because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to high-flow nasal cannula.Severe cases occur mainly in older adults (those over 60 years of age and, in particular, those over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have enough beds per head in hospitals, limiting the health system’s ability to handle the sudden increase in severe COVID-19 cases requiring hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support, and 1.4% died.
In China, approximately 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 eventually transfer to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex when a COVID-19 patient presents with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and oxygenation becomes increasingly difficult.
Respirators that have different pressure control modes and PPTE are needed to maximize oxygen supply, while minimizing the risk of lung injury associated with the respirator and pneumothorax.
Older respirators may not have high PPTE.
Research into potential treatments began in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although the development of new drugs may take until 2021, several drugs being tested are already approved for other uses or are in advanced testing.
Antiviral drugs can be tried in people with severe illness.
The FDA has granted temporary authorization to convalescent plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where the person's life is at serious and immediate risk.
It has not undergone the clinical studies necessary to demonstrate whether it is safe and effective for a disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the disease outbreak.
Users must enter their name and identification number.
The application can detect “narrow contact” and thus a potential risk of infection by surveillance data.
Each user can also control the status of three other users.
If a possible risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-confinement, but also alerts local health officials. Big data analysis of cell phone information, facial recognition technology, cell phone tracking, and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and those they came into contact with in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to track the mobile phone data of people suspected of having coronavirus.
The move was taken to bolster quarantine and protect those who may come into contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared the summarized location data of the phones with the German federal government agency, Robert Koch Institute, in order to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia implemented facial recognition technology to detect quarantine breaches.
Regional Health Commissioner Giulio Gallera said mobile phone operators have informed him that “40% of people are still on the move anyway.”
The German government conducted a 48-hour weekend hackathon with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid made a global call for creative solutions against the spread of the coronavirus.
People may feel distress over quarantine, travel restrictions, and the side effects of treatment or fear the infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O’Connor as saying: “Increasing social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic problems are a perfect storm for people’s mental health and well-being.”
The disease may follow a mild course with few or no symptoms, so it will resemble other upper respiratory diseases, such as the common cold.
Mild cases usually recover within two weeks, while severe or critical cases may take three to six weeks to do so.
Pregnant women may be at risk for serious infection with the COVID-19 virus, according to data from other similar viruses, such as the SARS virus and MERS, but the COVID-19 data are insufficient.In some people, COVID-19 can affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In more severe cases, COVID-19 can rapidly progress to water respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that causes respiratory failure, septic shock, and multi-organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, impaired clotting, and damage to the heart, kidney, and liver.
Impaired coagulation, specifically increased prothombine time, has been reported in 6% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19; whereas impaired renal function is observed in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20 to 30% of people with CODIV-19 have elevated liver enzymes (aminotransferases).
According to the same report, the average time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five days of hospitalization.
However, for patients transferred to the ICU, an average of seven days elapsed between hospitalization and death.
In an incipient case study, the mean time from first symptoms to death was 14 days, with a complete interval of 6 to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, the mortality rate among males was 2.8 percent and among females was 1.7 percent.
Histopathological examinations of postmortem samples of the lungs show diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in pneumocytes.
The image of the lungs resembled acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by China’s National Health Commission, heart damage resulted from elevated troponin levels or cardiac arrest.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of hospitalized people had a pre-existing condition. The availability of medical resources and the socioeconomic aspects of a region can also affect mortality.
Estimates of mortality from the condition vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
Insufficient counting of mild cases can cause the mortality rate to be overestimated.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of past cases may indicate that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to suffer severe symptoms of COVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely to need intensive care or die compared to non-smokers.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20 to 30 percent decrease in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and images of the lungs suggest organ involvement.
This can also cause post-intensive care syndrome after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was unknown whether previous infections generated effective long-term immunity in people who recovered from the disease.
It seems that immunity is possible, based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but cases recovered from COVID-19 have been reported that subsequently tested positive for coronavirus.
These cases are thought to be a worsening of a persistent infection and not a reinfection.
This virus is considered to be natural and of animal origin, by means of an interspecific infection.
The actual origin is not known, but by December 2019, the spread of the infection was almost entirely due to human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, noted as the first date of onset of symptoms to December 1, 2019.
Official WHO publications reported that the first manifestation of symptoms was on December 8, 2019.
In general, several measures are taken to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary by region and over time, and are affected by the volume of testing, the quality of the health system, treatment options, the time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, sex, and general health.
In late 2019, WHO assigned ICD-10 emergency disease codes U07.1 to laboratory-confirmed deaths from SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 to deaths with a clinical or epidemiological diagnosis of COVID-19 without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the overall case fatality rate is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of April 17, 2020.
Other measures include the case fatality rate in diagnosed patients (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed people who die from a disease, and the case fatality rate in infected people, which reflects the percentage of infected people (with or without a diagnosis) who die from a disease.
These statistics do not depend on time and follow a specific population from infection to case resolution.
While not all infected people produce antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information about how many people became infected.
At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4600 inhabitants, 80 (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease spread during carnival festivals and affected the youngest, so there was relatively low mortality, and it is possible that not all COVID-19 deaths have been classified as such.
Moreover, the German health system has not been overtaken.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population has antibodies, as determined from blood donors.
It has been confirmed that 69 (0.004% of the population) died from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the mortality rate are different for men and women.
Mortality is highest among males in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The greatest risk for males is for those in their 50s, and the gap between males and females narrows only at age 90.
In China, the death rate was 2.8 for males and 1.7 for females.
The exact reasons for this sex difference are not known, but could be due to genetic and behavioral factors.
Sex-based immunological differences, fewer women smoking, and the fact that males have comorbid conditions, such as hypertension, at a younger age could have contributed to the higher mortality rate in males.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were male and 72% of those killed by COVID-19 were male.
As of April 2020, the U.S. Government does not track information about sex in COVID-19 infections.
Research shows that viral diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS, affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of health workers, particularly nurses, are women, and they are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19".
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO refers to corona, VI to virus, D to disease and 19 to the date the outbreak was discovered: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographic location (e.g., China), animal species, or group of people, consistent with international recommendations under the name to prevent stigmatization. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The WHO also uses “the COVID-19 virus” and “the virus responsible for COVID-19” in public communications.
It is common for "coronavirus" to be used to refer to both the disease and the virus.
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, it was common for the virus and disease to be referred to as “coronavirus” and “Wuhan coronavirus.”
In January 2020, the WHO recommended 2019-nCov and water respiratory disease for 2019-nCoV as temporary names for the virus and disease, in line with the 2015 indication not to use locations in the name of viruses and diseases.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued on February 11, 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing health material, such as nasal swabs and respirator parts.
For example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a respirator valve and the supplier could not deliver it in the required time, a local start-up reverse-engineered and printed the 100 valves needed overnight.
After the initial COVID-19 outbreak, conspiracy theories, false information, and misinformation about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of the disease quickly spread over the Internet.
It seems that humans can transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study found no evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks or chickens.
There are no drugs or vaccines approved to treat the disease.
Government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers are conducting international research on COVID-19 vaccines and drugs.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the “SOLIDARITY Trial” to evaluate the therapeutic effects of the four most promising existing antiviral compounds in terms of efficacy.
There is no vaccine, but several agencies are actively developing potential vaccines.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is being used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use receptor ACE2 to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being investigated.
First, researchers are looking to develop a complete virus vaccine.
The use of this virus, whether inactive or dead, aims to generate a rapid immune response of the human body to a new infection by the COVID-19 virus.
A second strategy, subunit vaccines, seeks to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S protein that helps the virus get into the receptor ACE2.
A third strategy is nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique for creating vaccines).
Experimental vaccines from any of these strategies should be studied to determine their safety and efficacy.On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine with four volunteers began in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless copy of the genetic code of the virus that causes the disease.It has been suggested that antibody-based improvement is a potential challenge for the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccines, but this is controversial.
As of April 2020, there are more than 300 active clinical trials.
Seven trials evaluated already approved treatments for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Repurposed antiviral drugs make up the bulk of Chinese research, including nine phase III trials of remdesivir in several countries due to report in late April.
In April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical developments on the vaccine and possible drugs against COVID-19 was underway. Several antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 are being evaluated, including the following: remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with interferon-beta.
As of March 2020, there is tentative evidence for the efficacy of remdesivir.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with compassionate use of remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the US, China and Italy. Chloroquine, which was previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020. The results obtained were preliminary.
However, there are requests for peer reviews for research.
The health authorities of Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, although the Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends a daily dose of one gram, it notes that twice that dose is very dangerous and could be lethal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an urgent use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of treating physicians of COVID-19 patients. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes the use of interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are needed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
It has been recommended that further in vivo studies of nitazoxanide be conducted, after determining that low concentrations inhibit SARS-CoV-2.Studies have shown that initial priming of protein S by type 2 transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with receptor ACE2.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have important limitations that prevent the medical community from adopting these treatments without further studies.Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and does not have a known function in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokine release can be a complication of the later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have properties that prevent the release of cytokines.The National Health Commission of China included tocilizumab in the treatment guidelines after completion of a small study.
It is in a non-randomized national phase II trial in Italy after seeing positive results in people with the severe disease.
It is expected that, in combination with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokine releases, it counteracts such effects, which are believed to be the cause of death for some infected people.
The FDA approved the interleukin-6 receptor antagonist based on past cases for the treatment of steroid-resistant cytokine release syndrome induced by another cause, the treatment of T-CAR T lymphocytes, in 2017.
To date, there is no non-randomized controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system from those who have recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them is being investigated as a method of passive immunization without vaccines.
This strategy was tested with the SRAG with inconclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mechanism of action by which passive antibody treatment can defend against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms are possible, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity or phagocytosis.
Other forms of passive antibody treatment are being developed, for example, using fabricated monoclonal antibodies.
The production of convalescent serum, which consists of the liquid part of the blood of recovered patients and contains specific antibodies against this virus, could be increased to achieve a faster distribution.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, who later died of COVID-19 after raising awareness about the spread of the virus.
