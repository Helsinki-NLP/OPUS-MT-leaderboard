Members of the National Assembly of Wales are concerned that they may give the impression that they are "puppets".
Several members of the National Assembly of Wales are dismayed that they have been suggested to change their title to MWP (Members of the Parliament of Wales).
This problem was caused by plans to change the name of the assembly within the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the National Assembly of Wales present on the political scene fear that this would cause ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party of the National Assembly of Wales is concerned that he is "remaining with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, "twp" means "obtuse" and "pwp" means "faecal matter".
A member of the Wales Party of the National Assembly of Wales said the group as a whole was "not thrilled" and suggested alternatives.
One Conservative Party member said the group had an "open" attitude towards the name change, but also noted that the "MWP" resembled the "Muppet".
In this context, the letter "w" is pronounced in Wales as is the English "u" spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently preparing legislation to introduce the name change, said: "The final decision on how the members of the Assembly are appointed will certainly depend on the members themselves."
The 2017 Government of Wales Act gave the Assembly the opportunity to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which revealed that many of them want to use the "Wales Parliament".
As regards the title of the members of the National Assembly of Wales, the Commission preferred the ‘Members of Parliament of Wales’ or ‘WMP’, but the ‘MWP’ option received the most votes in the public consultation.
Members of the Wales National Assembly have reportedly suggested alternative options, but trying to reach a consensus could give head-butts to Elin Jones, the chairman of the steering committee, who is expected to submit the draft law on the changes within weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes to the way the assembly operates, including rules on disqualification of members and the structure of the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly shall have the last word as to their title when the law is debated.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change the country’s name
This Sunday, citizens with the right to vote will express their opinion on changing their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was organized to settle a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
The government in Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia's accession to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, a vehement opponent of the name change plebiscite, said he would not consider the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change is just a compromise that will allow them to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin’s Episcopal Church have stopped ringing as a result of problems faced by churches in Harlem.
“Historically, veterans of the place I spoke to told me that before, you would find a bar and a church on every street corner,” Adams said.
“Today, there are no more bars or churches.”
He also said that the disappearance of the bars is understandable.
“People socialize differently these days,” he said.
“Bars no longer serve as living rooms for the entire neighborhood, where people gather in the usual way.”
And as for the churches, he worries that the money obtained from the sale of goods will be spent faster than leaders expect and that, “sooner or later, the outcome will be the same.”
He added that churches could be replaced by residential buildings with condominiums filled with people who would not support the neighborhood’s remaining sanctuaries.
“The overwhelming majority of people who will buy condominiums in these buildings will be white,” he said, “therefore this will accelerate the closure of churches, as it is unlikely that many of the people who move into these condominiums will become members of those churches.”
Both churches were built by congregations of white people before Harlem became a metropolis of African-Americans – St. Martin’s Metropolitan Community in 1870, a decade ago.
The original Methodist congregation, made up of white people, moved out of the area after 1930.
A congregation of African-Americans, who were carrying out religious activities nearby, took over the building.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by a congregation of African-Americans, led by the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who boycotted merchants on 125th Street, a main shopping street in Harlem, who opposed hiring or promoting African-Americans.
A fire that occurred in 1939 greatly affected the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild it and included the carillon in them.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and successor to St. Martin's Church, called the carillon "the bells of the poor people."
The expert who commissioned the carillon in July described it differently: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also said it was the first carillon in the world operated by an African-American musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said it wasn't replaced at St. Martin's.
What was heard from St. Martin in recent months was a complicated story, which included architects and contractors, some brought in by church deacons, others by the episcopal diocese.
The sacristy, the governing body of the parish, made up of deacons, wrote to the diocese in July to complain that the diocese would “seek to pass on the costs” to the sacristy, even though it was not involved in the employment of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some of the parishioners complained about the lack of transparency that the diocese had shown.
Shark Injures 13-Year-Old Boy Trying to Catch Lobster in California
Authorities said Saturday a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy as he swam trying to catch lobsters in California on the opening day of lobster season.
The attack took place around 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been swimming for about half an hour with his friends on Saturday morning when he heard a little boy screaming for help and then moved in with a group that helped him out of the water.
Hammel said he initially thought the boy was excited about catching a lobster, but then realized he was yelling, “He bit me!
He bit me!"
The entire clavicle was torn, Hammel said, noting when he reached the boy.
“I yelled at everyone in the water and told them to get out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’”
The boy was taken by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is still in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is not known.
The lifeguard, Captain Larry Giles, told a news conference that a shark was spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was concluded that it is not a species of shark that poses a danger.
Giles added that the victim suffered trauma to the upper torso.
Authorities restricted access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigations and safety reasons.
Giles also noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but many of them are not considered dangerous.
Retailer Sainsbury plans to strengthen its position in the UK beauty and fashion market
Sainsbury takes over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, providing department stores with beauty products in the style of a department store with specialist sales assistants.
As part of a <0xC2><0xA3>2.8bn consolidation in the UK beauty market, which continues to grow, although sales of household and fashion products are not up to par, the larger beauty product districts will be tested in 11 stores across the country and will be integrated into several stores in the next year if successful.
The investment in the beauty industry comes as supermarkets are looking for a way to use the space previously intended for televisions, microwaves and household products.
Retailer Sainsbury’s representatives said the number of beauty products it offers will be doubled to 3,000 products, including, for the first time, brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing games, such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, will also receive more space, with marked areas, similar to those in Boots stores.
The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique range of make-up products, which means that most of the products are aimed at vegans, a demand that is increasingly common among young shoppers.
In addition, the products of French retailer The Fragrance Shop will be included in two Sainsbury’s chain stores for testing purposes, the first opened last week in Croydon, in the south of London, and the second in Selly Oak, Birmingham, in the second part of this year.
Online shopping and the tendency to buy smaller amounts of food every day from the nearest grocery store means that supermarkets need to find new ways to motivate people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, the chief executive of retailer Sainsbury’s, said outlets will look more and more like universal stores as supermarket chains try to cope with the battle with big discount stores Aldi and Lidl, which offer more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury’s has included both Argos outlet products in hundreds of stores and Habitats since it acquired both chains two years ago, which means it has seen food sales increase as well as increased profit.
The supermarket’s previous attempt to refresh its pharmaceuticals and beauty products compartments failed.
Sainsbury tried to merge with Boots in the early 2000s, but negotiations ceased after a dispute over how to split Boots' stores' revenue into its supermarkets.
The new strategy was devised after Sainsbury sold his pharmaceutical business, which included 281 stores, to Celesio, which owns Lloyds Pharmacy, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
This means Lloyds will play an important role in the plan, adding an extensive range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Chief Commercial Officer of Sainsbury’s, said: “We have transformed the look of our districts with beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialized training of our colleagues, who will be at your disposal to give you advice.
Our range of brands can adapt to all needs, and the attractive environment and convenient locations make us an extraordinary location to purchase beauty products, revolutionizing the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby pulled out of a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million contract.
"Dragons' Den" star Peter Jones is furious after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million lifestyle deal with his company to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby does not have time to get involved in their project related to the Truly brand, which includes accessories and household items.
The couple's company was compared to the Goop brand owned by Gwyneth Paltrow.
The host of “This Morning,” 37, announced on Instagram that she would be retiring.
Holly Willoughby generated the anger of Peter Jones, the protagonist of the show "Dragons' Den", retiring at the last moment from their lifestyle services business to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Jones reportedly became enraged when one of television’s most beloved people admitted on Tuesday during a tense meeting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts, worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million, no longer allow her to dedicate herself to their brand, Truly, what accessories she includes.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and almost doubled Willoughby's fortune to an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
After 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was quitting his contract for Truly, Jones left the UK to take refuge in one of his holiday homes.
A source said: “Truly was by far one of Holly’s top priorities.
It was to be her long-term future for the next two decades.
The decision to withdraw shocked everyone.
No one could believe what had happened on Tuesday, but there was still a little bit to go before the launch.
There's a warehouse full of products at Marlow headquarters that are ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of This Morning, one of the UK’s best-selling television shows, could cause the company millions of dollars in damage as a result of investments in products such as pillows and candles, clothing and household items, as well as the possible further delay of the launch.
It can also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and Dan Baldwin, her husband, have been friends for ten years with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby co-founded the Truly brand with Capp in 2016, and the 52-year-old Jones joined them as a director in March.
The couples spend their vacations together, and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin’s TV production company.
Willoughby will become M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's "I'm A Celebrity."
A source close to Jones said last night: “We don’t want to comment on his business.”
I was very hard, and then "we fell in love"
He joked that he would receive criticism from journalists for making a comment that some would consider "unworthy of a president" and that he had such a positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump take such a big step back?
He said Trump was imitating a "news anchor" voice.
“I haven’t taken a step back.”
He said Kim was interested in having another meeting after the initial meeting in Singapore in June was described by Trump as a huge step toward denuclearizing North Korea.
Negotiations on denuclearization have ended.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in June, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea had failed to notice an "appropriate response" from the United States on North Korea's previous disarmament efforts.
Instead, he noted that the United States continues to issue sanctions to put pressure on it.
Trump took a more optimistic view in his motivational speech.
"Everything is going well with regard to North Korea," he said.
“We are headed for a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We have a great relationship now.”
He also said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have had positive results: the cessation of missile tests, support for the release of hostages and the return of the U.S. military.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s easy to behave like a president, but if I were to behave like that, instead of the 10,000 people outside trying to get into this cramped arena, there would be about 200 people,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia have devastated an island, killing hundreds of people.
After the Lombok earthquake, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok’s population has been displaced, it has not been declared a national disaster, a necessary condition for triggering international relief actions.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have been very clear that they are not asking for international assistance, so it's a bit of a difficult situation," Sumbung said.
Although the Save the Children Foundation is trying to form a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet known whether foreign staff are allowed on-site access.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies can contribute to relief efforts.
Given the constant earthquakes Indonesia has endured, it is unbelievable that the country continues to be insufficiently prepared for the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not very often found on other coasts.
It appears that the lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although a warning was issued, may have contributed to the loss of life.
Even under the best of circumstances, travelling between islands in Indonesia proves to be a challenge.
Natural disasters make this even more difficult.
A hospital ship that has been stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is heading for Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the scene of the new calamity.
President Joko Widodo has made improving Indonesia's poor infrastructure the focus of his election campaign and has lavished money on roads and railways.
But the lack of funds has affected Joko's administration, which will participate in a new election campaign next year.
Joko is also facing persistent pressure from sectarians in Indonesia, as members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs clashed in the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows, as well as other rudimentary weapons.
Video: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge concedes the saving goal and equalises the score in the game against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea with an 89th-minute goal on Saturday at Stamford Bridge football stadium in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri, while he was about 30 yards from the opponent's goal, and his team was led by Chelsea 1-0.
He hit the ball and sent it to the left before taking a shot in the direction of the goal.
The ball reached over the box, heading to the top right corner of the goal.
Finally, the ball went past Kepa Arrizabalaga who jumped into it and fell into the goal.
“I just had to try to get in the ideal position, to get the ball, and players like Shaq are always trying to get as far forward as possible, so I tried to get as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante coming and it was enough, I didn’t think much about it, I just took the ball further.”
Chelsea led 1-0 at halftime after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The forward of the blue team sent the ball to Mateo Kovacic, and then turned in the middle of the field and ran towards the Liverpool half of the field.
Kovacic made a quick one-two move in the middle of the field.
Then he sent the ball to Hazard, who got into the box.
Hazard overcame the defence and sent the ball into the net, managing to clear it with his left foot and make it past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will have a match against Napoli in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3pm at the Stadio Sao Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3pm in London.
The death toll from Indonesia’s tsunami has reached 832.
The death toll from the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami reached 832, according to the national disaster agency, on Sunday morning.
Several people were trapped under the ruins of buildings collapsed by the 7.5-magnitude quake that struck on Friday and triggered waves of up to 6 meters, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has a population of more than 380,000 people, was covered by debris from the collapse of buildings.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of stabbing a woman to death.
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street and a man suspected of murder was arrested.
Police have asked people in the area who have heard or seen anything related to this subject to come to the precinct for statements.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is in its infancy, but I am appealing to anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead who heard or saw anything suspicious to contact us.
I also want to ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who have recorded any useful materials with the help of the on-board camera to contact us if they have information essential to our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed the body belonged to a Birkenhead woman and was found on property.
This afternoon, at the scene of the crime came a few people who think they know the woman to ask questions about the place where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing, and police have said they are trying to inform the victim’s relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews tried to return to his own apartment, but was told by police that no one is allowed to enter the building.
He was shocked when he found out what had happened.
People living in the building were told it would take a few hours before they would be allowed to enter.
A police officer told a person that the entire area is now considered the scene of the crime.
At the scene, a woman appeared in tears.
Repeating over and over again, “It’s so terrible!”
At 14:00, two police vans were in the perimeter and another was outside.
A few police officers were standing in the perimeter, monitoring the apartment block.
Anyone with information is asked to send a message directly to the police <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 and mention case 247 from September 30.
Cromwell’s statue in Parliament becomes the latest memorial to be hit by altercations over ‘rewriting history’
Its removal would represent a poetic justice for the Taliban-style destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But Cromwell described Jeremy Crick's suggestion as "crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in the current debate about removing statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell from outside the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was neither commanded nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps a wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas of the previous century.
The magnificent depiction of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is evidence of 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many believe is worth celebrating.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as the defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Regardless of whether it is an exact representation, this is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
But surely the conflict of the middle of the seventeenth century determined the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable individual figure, who represents a part of this division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and commemorating."
A pig has caused the death of a farmer in China.
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local news agencies.
The man, identified only by his surname “Yuan,” was found dead after an artery was severed and covered in blood near a pig farm in Liupanshui square in Guizhou province, according to Sunday’s editorial in the South China Morning Post.
A pig farmer was preparing to inject pig vaccines at a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
It appears that he had come with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a neighboring hut was open.
He said there was a large male pig in the kennel with blood on his mouth.
Coroners confirmed that a pig weighing around 300kg caused the farmer’s death, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were full of blood and sprained,” the cousin, whose surname is “Wu,” told Guiyang Evening News.
Surveillance cameras recorded Yuan entering the market Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
About an hour later, his body was found.
The animal that caused the man’s death did not belong to Yuan, nor to his cousin.
A market representative told Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking someone else, while police collected evidence from the crime scene.
It appears that Yuan's family and authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pigs attacking humans have also been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years ago, because of a 300kg pig, a man from Wales was stuck in his tractor until his wife came to scare and chase the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the taste of blood can trigger such reactions.
“It’s just playing.
They like to bite, they are very curious... they don’t want to hurt you.
You just have to give them the respect they deserve,” he said.
Hurricane Rosa, which has lost its intensity, will cause heavy rains in the southwestern United States
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is losing in intensity as it moves toward cooler waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring rains that will cause flooding in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa is registering wind conditions at a speed of 85 km/h, being a Category 1 hurricane, from 5 a.m. on Sunday and has been located about 600 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to arrive in the north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression zone has begun to form across the Pacific Ocean and is moving eastward toward the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday, in the form of a tropical storm, it will begin to push intense tropical moisture from the north to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring rainfall of up to 25 cm in some parts of Mexico.
Then, the tropical humidity that will interact with the depression area will generate abundant rains in the southwest in the coming days.
Locally, rainfall between 3 and 10 cm will cause dangerous flash floods, debris flows and possibly landslides in the desert.
Intense tropical humidity will cause precipitation rates of up to 5 and 8 cm per hour in certain areas, especially in some parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall is expected to range from 5 to 10 cm in the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Rapid flooding may occur due to rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It is not recommended to venture into the desert on foot, given the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rain could cause the canyons to turn into violent rivers, and storms will bring local gusts of wind and dust.
The approaching depression zone will bring torrential rains to areas off the southern coast of California.
Precipitation of almost 2 cm is possible, which could cause minor flows of debris and slippery roads.
These will be the first rainfall in the region in the wet season.
Scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona in the second part of Sunday and the first part of Monday, before rain spreads more Monday evening and Tuesday.
Intense rainfall will spread into the so-called “four corners” on Tuesday and persist until Wednesday.
In October there will be intense temperature changes in the U.S., as the Arctic region will become colder, but the tropics remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
On Sunday, there are dramatic temperature differences in the central area of the United States.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 10 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the prolonged heat of summer will try to form and expand again.
Much of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to face a warm October start, with temperatures of up to 27 degrees in large areas, from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
On Tuesday, New York City could reach 27 degrees, about 4 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high chance of above-average temperatures for the eastern U.S. by the first half of October.
More than 20 million people attended Brett Kavanaugh’s hearing.
More than 20 million people watched Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault allegedly in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
At the same time, the political confrontation continued, with TV stations interrupting Friday’s normal schedule for a breaking news story: an agreement reached between Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct an investigation of the allegations for a week.
Ford told the court she was 100 percent sure Kavanaugh had harassed her while he was intoxicated and had tried to strip her naked at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an intense testimony, said he is 100 percent sure this did not happen.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million people watched the hearing on Friday.
The company has counted average viewing on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available to other networks that broadcast it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people who watch from the office.
To put this in perspective, this audience is similar to that for a football game in the play-offs or the Academy Awards.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose op-ed hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh’s nomination, was ahead of all channels, averaging 5.69 million viewers during the daily hearing.
ABC was in second place, with a viewership of 3.26 million.
According to Nielsen, CBS was watched by 3.1 million people, NBC by 2.94 million, MSNBC by 2.89 million, and CNN by 2.52 million.
Interest remained at a high level after the hearing.
Flake was at the center of Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican’s office issued a statement that it would vote in Kavanaugh’s favor, he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning as protesters shouted at him and he tried to climb into an elevator at a Judiciary Committee meeting.
He stared down for a few minutes as people scolded him, and it was all broadcast live on CNN.
“I’m standing right here in front of you,” one woman said.
“Do you think he’s telling us the truth?
He was told, “You have power, while so many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office issued a statement and said before the elevator closed that he would have more to say at the committee meeting.
Television stations later broadcast the vote live on the Judiciary Committee to advance Kavanaugh's nomination for a Senate vote.
But Flake said he would only do so if the FBI agreed to consider the allegations against the nominee next week, which minority Democrats have demanded.
Flake was largely convinced by his conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake's decision came after a conversation with Coons and several senators afterwards.
Flake's election was an important one, as it was obvious that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
UK PM accuses critics of ‘political games’ over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of her plans to leave the European Union of “political games” with Britain’s future and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
Theresa May, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, attended the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview alongside his front-page photo, former Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued an attack on her Brexit plan, the so-called Chequers plan, saying the proposal for Britain and the European Union to collect tariffs on each other was “completely ridiculous”.
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspected of fatally shooting the LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wayde Sims, the 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and jailed on charges of second-degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities released footage of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the brawl.
Police recovered the glasses from the crime scene and said they found Simpson’s DNA on them, according to WAFB, a CBS affiliate.
After questioning Simpson, police say he admitted to shooting Wayde dead.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to the lawyer.
The Baton Rouge Office of Forensic Medicine released a preliminary report Friday, saying the death was caused by a gunshot to the head through the neck.
The department credits the Louisiana police force, the state police crime lab, Southern University police, and citizens in the area for the assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked police for "diligence and the pursuit of justice."
Sims was 20.
The six-foot-tall striker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and had 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team is "devastated" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
“This worries me all the time,” Wade said.
A volcano has dumped a column of ash over Mexico City.
The ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to keep their distance from the volcano after activity in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The center monitored several snarls and vibrations.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on car windshields in Mexico City neighborhoods such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity at the volcano, which is 72 km southeast of the capital, after a 7.1-magnitude earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Clashes between police and Catalan separatists ahead of anniversary of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with gendarmes on the first anniversary of Catalonia's secession vote, rallying thousands of opposition demonstrators.
A group of masked pro-separatists held at a distance from the gendarmes bombarded them with eggs and powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that were usually flooded by tourists.
The brawl escalated later, with police using their batons to control the situation.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted “We don’t forget, we don’t forgive,” while unionist protesters shouted “Long live Spain!”
14 people received medical care for minor injuries caused during the protests, according to local media.
Tensions remain high in the region that wants to become independent a year after the October 1 referendum was deemed illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters overwhelmingly chose to become independent, although voter turnout was low, and those against secession largely boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 100 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations in the region, leading to violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups camped overnight on Friday evening to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but the protesters were forced to choose a new path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had any hope of Catalonia gaining independence.
“Last year I had some of the best moments of my life.
I watched my parents cry for joy that I could vote, but now we have nothing to do,” he said.
Despite a vital but close victory in regional elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties have tried to maintain momentum this year, with many of the country’s best-known leaders either in exile or in detention awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest on his phone in support of police, said politicians on both sides had fuelled the conflict.
“The situation is becoming more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders jailed since the end of last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament elections next year.
“As a candidate in the European elections it is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and repression we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Several men arrested after driving into a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car broke into a Londonderry home several times.
The incident took place on Thursday at about 7:30 p.m. in Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage had been done to the gates and even the building.
It seems that at one point a crossbow was used against the car.
Menga's shot helped Livingston win 1-0 over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
Livingston left the Rangers unchallenged, with Steven Gerrard reaching his second loss in 18 games as manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's shot proved to make a difference while Gary Holt's team played at the same level as Hibernian in the second half.
Gerrard's side are without a away Premier League win this season and face the Hearts leaders, trailing them by eight points next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston remains undefeated in the division up to six games, with Holt’s head coach still feeling the taste of defeat as he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses his chance against hard-hitting visitors
Holt's team should have advanced well before scoring, and their orientation caused all sorts of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to break through and tried to kick into the goal space, then Alan Lithgow managed to kick wide after he slipped in to intercept the ball sent with Craig Halkett's head.
The hosts were content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could make visitors trouble at free kicks.
And that was how the crucial void came about.
Rangers accepted a free-kick, and Livingston made an opener, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson working together to pass to Menga, who shot and scored from the centre of the box.
At that stage, Rangers had dominated possession, but faced the host's impenetrable defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely undisturbed for the rest of the match.
This pattern of play continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a defense from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was unsuccessful against Allan McGregor of Rangers, and Lithgow took a wide shot from another Livingston player.
Diagonal passes continued to come into Livingston's box, but to no avail, and the two penalty requests - after Halkett had roughed up Glenn Middleton and after a sledgehammer - were not accepted.
"Phenomenal game" offered by Livingston – analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They were excellent, without exception, continuing to exceed expectations on an upward trajectory.
Their style of play and the team haven’t changed since returning to the top, but Holt deserves credit for the way he’s coached his team since taking over.
He had so many models to follow.
Captain Halkett was great with an excellently organized defense, while Menga put Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in trouble throughout the game.
But the Rangers weren’t very inspired.
Although they have performed well since being led by Gerrard, they have not reached the same standards.
The goal passes were unsuccessful, they only managed once to catch the goal of the opponents free, and this should be a wake-up call for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the standings.
Joint reactions on Erdogan's visit to Cologne
It was all pink on Saturday (September 29th), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin for breakfast.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, aimed at remedying relations between NATO allies.
They are unhappy with issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's EU membership.
In this context, Erdogan went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest number of Turkish citizens in the world, outside of Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but enough supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, mostly Kurdish, have raised their voices, condemning Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him with open arms into the country.
The contradictory protests reflect the division over a visitor considered a hero by some of Germany's Turks and an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies as a result of a collision with a car
A cyclist has died after a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped, and paramedics showed up at the scene of the accident, but the man died at the scene.
The accident comes just a few months after another cyclist died in an accident on Childers Street, in which the driver fled the scene, which is about a mile from where Saturday’s crash took place.
Metropolitan police said officers were trying to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Access is restricted in that area, the route of the buses is diverted, and motorcyclists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Officers Injured in Clashes
Six prison officers were injured in a brawl at a high-security men's prison, a prison official said.
On Sunday, a brawl broke out at HMP Long Martin in Worcestershire at around 9:30am, which is ongoing.
Specialised officers were brought in to deal with the brawl, which involved eight inmates, isolated in a wing.
Officers were treated on site for minor injuries to the face.
A prison spokesman said: “The assistance of the prison’s specialist staff has been requested to deal with an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members received medical care after they were injured.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we have very clear rules regarding those responsible, who will be transferred to the police and could spend a longer period of time behind bars.”
HMP Long Lartin holds more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison governor needed hospital treatment after being attacked by an inmate.
And last year, in October, riot officers were called to prison to deal with a very serious situation, with staff being attacked with billiard balls.
Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City are in danger of being flooded due to Hurricane Rosa (dry areas can enjoy benefits as a result of this)
A tropical depression rarely happens in Arizona, but this is quite likely to happen early next week, as the remaining energy resources of Hurricane Rosa will be used in the southwestern desert, posing a risk of rapid flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued rapid flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to have a direct trajectory to Phoenix on Tuesday, and in the latter part of Monday it will cause precipitation.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix announced in a Twitter message that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained a tropical storm or depression state at a distance of about 200 miles (320 km) from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane with a range of about 60 km from the Arizona border.
The National Hurricane Center’s latest models predict rainfall between 5 and 10 cm, with isolated amounts of up to 15 cm in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
In other areas of the southwest desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, quantities ranging from 3 to 5 cm will be recorded, with total quantities possible up to 10 cm in isolated areas.
For regions that are not at risk of rapid flooding, the rain brought by Rosa could be a blessing, given that the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, in some areas, heavy rain will be beneficial, as the southwest is facing drought problems.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least a severe drought, the second-largest category, according to weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will lead to landslides on Mexico’s Baja California peninsula.
Rosa, which still had hurricane power on Sunday morning, with a wind of up to 136 km per hour, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north at 19 km per hour.
The storm will encounter colder waters in the Pacific and will therefore subside.
Thus, it is expected to produce landslides in Mexico, with a tropical storm power in the afternoon or evening of Monday.
Heavy rains in Mexico could be significant, posing a high flood risk.
“Torrent rains of between 8 and 10 cm are expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, and can reach up to 25 cm,” according to weather.com.
Rosa will then head north into Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border on Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, passing through Arizona and reaching southern Utah on Tuesday night.
"The main danger posed by Rosa or her remains is the extreme torrential rain from Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the desert in the southwestern United States," a representative of the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to produce flash floods, which will endanger people’s lives, and bring waste streams to deserts, as well as landslides in mountain areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday at about 4 a.m.
He was taken to the hospital, where he is in stable condition.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old were arrested last night in the Radstock area, according to Avon and Somerset police.
The officers asked for help from citizens who might have material on their mobile phone, respectively to report to the police station.
Trump said Kavanaugh faced "discontentment and anger" from the Democratic Party.
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party’s merciless and outrageous tactics,” Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump also said Kavanaugh faced "discontentment and anger" from the Democratic Party during his nomination.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh testified before Congress, vehemently denying Christine Blasey Ford’s claims about sexually harassing her ten years ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing about her claim.
The president said Saturday that "the American people saw that day the genius, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh.
“A confirmation vote by Judge Kavanaugh is a confirmation vote for one of the best legal minds of this generation,” he told the crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh’s nomination while talking about the importance of Republican presence in the midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lives.
I’m not running for office, but in a way, I’m running for office,” he said.
“For this reason, I express my positive opinion about the candidates I consider to be outstanding.”
Trump said Democrats were on a mission to “resist and obstruct.”
The first key procedural vote in the Senate since Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a GOP executive assistant told CNN.
Hundreds of People Killed in Indonesia Earthquake, Number on the Rise
At least 384 people have been killed, many of them by the huge waves that hit the beaches when a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit Indonesia’s Sulawesi island, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday at a beach festival in the city of Palu, when waves six meters high hit the beach at dusk, people being taken by the waters and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was followed by an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
"When the tsunami threat was issued yesterday, people were still watching their activities on the beach and did not immediately run, becoming victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the BNPB disaster mitigation agency, told a news conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami brought with it cars, logs, houses, hitting everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled offshore at a speed of 800 km/h (500 mph) before hitting land.
He added that some people had to climb trees to escape the tsunami and survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated in 24 centers in Palu.
Photos released by the disaster agency show several destroyed buildings and shops, overturned and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, aftershocks continued to rock the coastal city.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s Assessment and Application Technology Agency (BPPT) said the energy emitted by Friday’s powerful earthquake was about 200 times greater than the power of the World War II atomic bomb at Hiroshima.
The geographical structure of the city, which sits at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have intensified the magnitude of the tsunami, he added.
Nugroho described the damage as "extended" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, in addition to the 540 injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be greater along the coast 300km north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the quake's epicenter.
The communications were “completely disrupted, without any information” in Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said, adding that its staff and volunteers are heading to the affected areas.
He added: “This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse.”
On Saturday, the agency was sharply criticised for failing to report that a tsunami would hit Palu, although authorities said the waves had reached the moment the warning was issued.
In posts on social media, a man on the top floor of a building can be heard shouting frantic warnings that the tsunami is approaching people on the adjacent street.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the shore, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the veracity of the material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that blocked communications in Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army has begun sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuees still need food and other basics.
The city's airport was reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has planned a visit to the evacuation centers in Palu for Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia is more than 800.
The situation is extremely serious.
While Word Vision staff from Donggala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where employees are housed in makeshift shelters in the office courtyard, they passed by devastating scenes, Doseba said.
He added: “They told me they saw many houses destroyed.”
The situation is very serious.
Even as aid groups began to take action to help in the event of a disaster, some people complained that foreign workers with comprehensive expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, financial resources, material delivery and personnel can only reach the site of a disaster if it is declared a national disaster area.
This hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for Indonesia's Red Cross.
“After the government says, ‘Yes, this is a national disaster,’ we can begin international assistance actions, but nothing has been announced yet.”
After the second night of Friday’s earthquake and tsunami in Palu, friends and families of the missing hoped that their loved ones would miraculously be saved from such a national disaster.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of a canal.
On Sunday, rescue workers released a woman who had been in ruins for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the national paragliding team, trained for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia, two of the missing paragliders.
Other people held captive at the Roa Roa hotel, including Mandagi, were his students.
“Given my experience in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon told how, hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel in the paragliding sports community, he sent desperate messages on WhatsApp to the Palu competitors who participated in the festival organized on the beach.
But there was only a gray check mark next to his messages, not two blue ones.
“I think that means the messages weren’t sent,” he said.
A group of thieves stole $26,750 while feeding an ATM in Newport on the Levee.
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was feeding an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport Police Department press release.
The driver of the car had emptied an ATM from the entertainment complex and was preparing to carry more money, Dennis McCarthy wrote in the statement.
While he was busy, another man “ran behind employee Brink” and stole a bag of money to be transported.
According to the statement, witnesses observed several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not mention the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identity is asked to contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West changes his stage name to 'Ye'
Rapper Kanye West changes his stage name to "Ye".
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday: “The individual officially known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, has been called "Ye" for some time and uses that title as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
This change comes ahead of her appearance on Saturday Night Live, where she is expected to release her new album, Yandhi.
It comes on the show in place of singer Ariana Grande, who canceled "for emotional reasons," the show's producer said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of the current stage name, West has previously stated that this word also has a religious significance to him.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you,’” West said earlier this year during a talk about the album’s title with radio host Big Boy.
“So I’m you, I’m us, it’s about us.
It all started with “Kanye”, which means the only one, and came to “Ye”, this being a reflection on our good, bad, unclear things and on the whole.
The album is more a reflection of who we are as people."
He is one of several rappers who have chosen to change their stage name.
Sean Combs had countless stage names, Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
And a former collaborator of West's, JAY-Z, changed his name, sometimes in hyphens, sometimes without, as well as in large letters.
Mexico's president vows not to use military force against civilians
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would “never use the army to repress the Mexican people.”
Troops fired at a peaceful demonstration in the market on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were taking root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to those who study and by opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and a lack of educational opportunities draw young people to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double funding for AI
As China becomes more active in AI, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on AI research, says Kai-Fu Lee, the AI investor and user who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several members of the U.S. government made announcements about AI, even though the U.S. lacks an official strategy for artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: it aims to be first in terms of AI innovation by 2030.
“Double the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that all other countries are much further behind the U.S. and we are looking for the next AI discovery,” Lee said.
The doubling of funding could double the chances of the next big AI achievement being made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s most prominent companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that defeated the American player Othello, who was the best in the field at the time, and later served as executive director at Microsoft Research and president of the Google subsidiary in China.
Lee praised previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be, to help identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government funding, Lee said.
“It’s not China that’s throwing sticks at academic leaders, it’s the corporations,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired outstanding graduates from universities to work on AI in recent years.
Lee said changes to immigration policy could help the U.S. step up its AI efforts.
“I think we should automatically give visas to PhD students in AI,” he said.
The State Council of China issued a New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation provides financial support to people in academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations provide money for researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic activity is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to engage industry partners and academics, and the White House announced the formation of a Selection Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, the U.S. Army Research Institute (DARPA) announced a $2 billion investment for an initiative called “AI Next.”
At the same time, NSF is investing more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, there have been no changes to U.S. legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission in the field of artificial intelligence.
Macedonians will vote in referendum if they want to change the country’s name
On Sunday, Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum whether to change the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a change that would resolve a decade-old dispute with Greece, which opposed its accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which comprises a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the neighboring country represents a claim on its territory and has opposed its membership in the EU and NATO.
The two governments agreed in June on the proposed new name, but opposition nationalists say the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's majority Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and that a boycott campaign had cast doubt on voter turnout, and it was possible that the 50 percent threshold needed to validate the referendum would not be reached.
The question on the ballot paper in the referendum will be: “Do you agree with joining the EU and NATO, accepting the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is a price to be paid by Macedonia, one of the countries that resulted from the breakup of Yugoslavia, to be accepted into entities such as the EU and NATO.
"I am here today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia to live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough members of parliament have said they will respect the result of the vote to make it decisive.
For the name to be changed, a two-thirds quorum in parliament is required.
The state electoral commission said no irregularities had been reported until 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66% of eligible voters turned out to vote.
“I came to vote for my children and for our place in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in Skopje, the country’s capital.
On September 30, 2018, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica, and their son Dushko voted for a referendum on changing Macedonia’s name, which will allow him to join NATO and enter the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and pulled chairs in front of the tents erected by those who will boycott the referendum.
“We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with our heads held high, and not through the back door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If we are not wanted under the name of Macedonia, we can go to other countries, such as China and Russia, and we can become part of the Eurasian Union."
Prime Minister Zaev said joining NATO would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
“I think the majority will be in favor of changing the name, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favor of joining NATO and the EU,” Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said one result in favor of changing the name would be “confirming our future.”
According to a poll published last Monday by the Policy Research Institute, between 30% and 43% of citizens with voting rights will participate in the referendum, under the necessary number of participants.
According to another poll conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote for change.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to pro-Western government policy since the government took office last May.
Video: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero manages to get through Brighton's entire defence and score a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made it through Brighton's defence and secured a 2-0 victory for Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
It seemed that Aguero was incredibly easy to score in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a midfield pass at the beginning of the sequence.
He moved very quickly among the three defensive players at Brighton, before reaching the free end of the field.
Then, Aguero found himself surrounded by four players from the opposing team.
He managed to pass a defender, and then passed several opposing players on the edge of the Brighton team's box.
After that, he made a pass to the left, the ball reaching Sterling.
The English striker sent the ball back to Aguero, who hit the ball with his right foot, managing to avoid Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan with a shot to the right side of the goal.
"Aguero is facing some problems with his feet," Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We talked to him and agreed to play 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We’re lucky that he scored a goal at that point.”
But Sterling is the one who got their initial lead for the Azuri in the Premier League match.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got a deep pass into Brighton's territory at that stage.
Then he gave a pass on the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane dribbled the ball a few times until he sent a pass to Sterling, who sent it in the direction of the goal.
The Azuri attacker hit the ball into the net just before heading off the field.
Manchester City will face Hoffenheim in the group stage on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to wreak havoc in match against Rockies
With the national team eliminated from the competition in the playoffs, there were not many reasons to force another start.
But Scherzer, being extremely competitive, hopes to win Sunday's game against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still play-off implications for the Rockies, who hold an advantage with a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
The Rockies secured at least one unpredictable spot with a 5-2 win against the national team on Friday night, but are still trying to retain their first division title.
“Even if we don’t play for anything, at least we can enjoy the atmosphere here in Denver alongside the crowd, and the other team would probably play at the highest level of any point I could face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to compete under these circumstances?”
The national team has yet to announce the player who will open Sunday’s match, but is reportedly inclined to let Scherzer take the first shot in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be at the opening kick of the 34th match, had a warm-up session on Thursday and will throw under normal conditions this Sunday.
The Washington midfielder has an 18-7 record and an ERA of 2.53 and 300 misses in 220 and 2/3 of games this season.
Trump expresses support for West Virginia
The president referred to the situation regarding the Supreme Court’s decision regarding Brett Kavanaugh as he talked about the importance of Republican presence in the midterm elections.
“All our efforts are at stake in November.
Five weeks to one of the most important choices of our lives.
This is one of the big ones, I’m not running, but I’m actually running, that’s why I’m trying so hard to support the good candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “You see this awful, radical group of Democrats, you see what’s happening right now.
And they are determined to take over power again by using whatever means necessary, you can see their wickedness.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to crush to get power and control, that’s what they want, to have power and control, and we’re not going to give it.”
He also said the Democrats were on a mission of "resistance and obstruction."
“And you can see that in the last four days,” he said, describing Democrats as “angerous and mean, naughty and lying.”
He referred to Senator Dianne Feinstein of the Democratic Party and part of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who was booed loudly by the public.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you divulge the document?
What's up?
No. Hmm... I... wait a minute – that was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party no longer tolerates people with a different point of view.
People who express their opinion are no longer tolerated.
I was not at all surprised that the Momentum activists in my local party supported the no-confidence motion as far as I was concerned.
After all, I am just one of the members of the Labour Party in Parliament who have been told that they are not welcome, just because we have expressed our opinion.
Joan Ryan, my colleague in Parliament, received similar treatment because she was vehement about anti-Semitism.
As far as I am concerned, the no-confidence motion was a criticism of me for not agreeing with what Jeremy Corbyn said.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, similar issues, ironically, on which even Jeremy did not have common views with previous leaders.
The Labour Party statement for Friday's meeting in Nottingham East said that "we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For much of the eight-year period as a Member of Parliament for the Labour Party, Friday night’s GC meetings were like this.
Unfortunately, today, many meetings do not take place in this way, and the promise of a “better, gentler” political environment has long been forgotten, if ever fulfilled.
It has become increasingly apparent that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged according to what is accepted by the leadership of the party.
Things have started to be this way since Jeremy became leader, when I noticed that some colleagues with whom I had a common political vision started to expect me to change my mind and agree with some things that I would not have agreed with before, including national security or the single market in the EU.
Every time I speak in public, no matter what I say, there follows a wave of abuse on desocialisation networks calling for my removal from the party, denouncing centrist politics, telling me I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only person facing this.
Indeed, I know that I am luckier than my colleagues because comments about me tend to be political in nature.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination shown by my colleagues who face sexual or racist abuse, but maintain their level of involvement in this regard.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that abuse has become a normal thing.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should embrace a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer accept different points of view within the party, and with each motion of censure or change of selection rules, the party becomes less and less flexible on this issue.
A lot of people have recommended to me in the last two years to put my head down, to not be so vocal, and everything will be fine like that.
But that’s not why I got into politics.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago when I was a student, motivated by the fact that the Thatcher government’s negligence led to the collapse of my class, I wanted to fight for improved public services for those who need them most, as a local councillor or minister.
I never hid my political views, including in the last election.
No person in Nottingham East can say that my views on policy and issues I disagree with in relation to the current leadership are unclear to him.
To the people who supported Friday’s motion, I can only say that, as the country moves towards Brexit, which will affect our local households, businesses and services, I do not understand their desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the only message I want to send is not to the Momentum group in Nottingham, but to the citizens, whether or not they are members of the Labour Party: I am proud to represent you and I promise you that no threat of removal from the party or political opportunism will stop me from making the decisions I consider to be in your best interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: the football team Ayr reaches the top of the rankings
Despite the fact that two late attempts somehow influenced the final result, there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win today's highly interactive match in Tennent's Premiership.
It is now at the top of the ranking, being the only team without any defeat in the ten.
In the end, it all came down to their better defense, as well as the fact that they took more of the chances that came their way, which helped the home team and thanked coach Peter Murchie.
“We’ve been put through several tests over the course of our matches so far and we continue to be unbeaten, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "The credit goes to the Ayr team, they took more chances than we did."
Grant Anderson's 14th minute try, transformed by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr an advantage, but a yellow card received by Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who was able to join the team, while playing for the Warriors, allowed Melrose to change the score, and Jason Baggot took advantage of a try.
Climo got a penalty for Ayr and, even in the middle of the match, managed to score, and then managed to turn an individual attempt, and the score was 17-5 for Ayr at halftime.
But Melrose started the second half very well, and Patrick Anderson's essay, transformed by Baggot, reduced the margin to five points.
The match was suspended for a few minutes due to the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, who was removed from the field with the stretcher, and since the restart of the game, Ayr unleashed through the attempt of the player Stafford McDowall, transformed by Climo.
Team Ayr captain Blair Macpherson then received a yellow card and again, the Melrose team made the backup player pay with an unconverted attempt by Bruce Colvine at the end of a dire pressure.
However, the home team recovered, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for catching Climo without a ball, MacPherson managed to score, giving Ayr the advantage.
Climo turned the attempt, as he did again near the start of the match, after Kyle Rowe executed a box kick and sent extreme Gregor Henry deep for the host team's fifth attempt.
The star of the sitcom "Still Game" seems ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kiernan looks set to move into the hospitality industry after learning he’s been appointed the head of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis on the BBC’s beloved show, writing the script and playing alongside his longtime partner, comedy actor Greg Hemphill.
The two announced that the next series, the one with the number nine, would be their last, and it seems that Kieman is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the information in the official register, this is the director of the company Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the news, though a source from the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wants to get involved in the "developing restaurant industry".
‘The sea is ours’: Bolivia hopes court reopens route to Pacific
Sailors patrol a naval headquarters full of cranes in La Paz.
Public buildings fly the blue flag, like the ocean.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are covered with the motto: “The sea is ours by right.
We have to get it back."
Throughout Bolivia, which has no outlet to the sea, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict of the 19th century is still alive – just like the desire to sail back to the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are probably at the highest level in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the necessary momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, awaits the outcome with a positive vision,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the ICJ’s decision on big screens across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will give a ruling in favor of Bolivia’s claim and that, after decades of firm talks, Chile is forced to negotiate a sovereign exit to the sea, Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia — who is facing a controversial re-election battle next year — also has much to gain from Monday’s decision.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised in late August.
But some analysts believe the court is unlikely to rule in Bolivia’s favor, and that too little would change if it did.
The UN body within the Netherlands does not have the power to grant territory that belongs to Chile and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the ICJ decision comes just six months after the final arguments were heard indicates that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And not only has Bolivia not been successful in its cause, but it is possible that the last four years have given it back.
"The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morales’ belligerent rhetoric has weakened any residual Chilean goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold talks after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision-making process was unusually quick.
Monday will bring for Bolivia “an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to “put an end to the 139 years of disagreements with mutual advantages,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales — still one of Latin America’s most beloved presidents — was using the maritime issue as a political prop.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“Decision is an opportunity to see that we have to move on from the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen if U.S. can't be trusted
Ri Yong Ho, North Korea’s foreign minister, said his country would never disarm its nuclear weapons if it could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke about this on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He urged the United States to keep its promises made during a summit in Singapore with rival leaders.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of restarting diplomatic action on the nuclear threat more than three months after his Singapore meeting with North Korean President Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was an "unreal dream" that continued sanctions and U.S. objections to the declaration of an end to the Korean War would ever cause the northern territory to give way.
Washington is reluctant to agree to the statement without Pyongyang first taking significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there are many skeptics who do not believe that Pyongyang has serious intentions to give up the arsenal that the country considers the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
A fashion show in Paris showcases the latest trends in hats and will be available in stores soon
If you are looking for hats to expand your collection or protect yourself completely from the sun, you no longer need to look.
Fashion designers Valentino and Thom Browne shocked participants at Paris Fashion Week by launching a series of oversized and extravagant hats for their spring-summer 2019 collection.
Unpractical hats conquered the Instagram platform this summer, and fashion designers sent the creations that steal your eyes on the podium.
The piece of resistance of the creation, made by Valentino, was an extravagant hat, beige, with a wide brim, similar to a feather, in which the heads of the models sank.
Other oversized accessories have included beaded melons, a wizard’s hat, and even a pineapple, but these aren’t designed to protect your head from the cold.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and brought more of Hannibal Lecter's chosen accessory, and not haute couture fashion.
One of the creations appeared to be diving gear, having an oxygen tube and goggles, while another appeared to be a cone with melted ice cream.
And if you want to continue to adopt such a fashion style, with oversized clothing items, you are lucky.
Stylists predict a return of enormous bonnets in luxury fashion stores.
The oversized hats are back after the appearance of the “La Bomba” hat, the straw hat with a wide brim, seen by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The return of the unpractical hat that appeared on all social networks caused the appearance of another oversized creation on the podium, namely the beach straw bag, with a size as large as the model in the swimsuit that wears it.
The orange raffia bag, with raffia fringes and a white leather handle, was the highlight of Jacquemus’ spring-summer 2019 “La Riviera” collection at Paris Fashion Week
Star designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see oversized hats and beach bags in luxury stores the following summer because the fashion designer has had such an impact that it will be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a record of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional exam results, which is underpinned by individual and collective successes in sport, art, music and other community endeavours.
With over 30,000 pupils in Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide services at the highest level to pupils and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for high school and higher education, their chosen career and their place as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a special school curriculum, we note that modern languages continue to be a popular and desired subject of choice within schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, your words will come to his mind.
If you speak to him in his own language, the words reach his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust people from other countries.
Based on the recent results of this year’s competition, we note that foreign languages are at the top of the rankings, with the highest rates of promotion within independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who have studied languages have obtained a Higher Grade A certificate.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72% of students earned a Higher Grade A certificate in Mandarin; also 72% of those who study German, 69% of those who study French, and 63% of those who study Spanish earned such a certificate.
This demonstrates that independent schools in Scotland support languages as vital skills that children and young people will definitely need in the future.
Now, foreign languages, as a subject, are held the same as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in independent school curricula and in other fields.
A survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that for the reasons employers gave for fighting for vacancies, 17% were attributed to a shortage of language skills.
As a result, language skills are increasingly becoming imperative for preparing young people for their future careers.
With more job opportunities requiring foreign languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
No matter what career someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future, having such a life-long skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of over 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% could not speak a foreign language well enough to carry a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage, 15%.
That’s why investing in language learning is important for today’s children.
With more languages, especially in developing economies, children will be more likely to find meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, every school will teach other languages.
A number of schools will focus on more modern classical languages, while others will learn languages that are considered to be most important to the UK when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest, there will always be more languages of choice within independent schools, with teachers who are specialized in this area.
Scottish Independent Schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and encourage them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future may be.
It cannot be denied at this time, in a global business environment, that languages continue to be vital to the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should indeed be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
We have to do it right (we have to do it right).
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron to make Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James debut for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes will play still remain to be settled.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell wrote on Twitter that James would likely play limited minutes.
Following training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need preseason games to prepare,” he said.
Time for Trump election rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five Trump rallies scheduled for next week, which include stops in places where the electorate favors him, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote for his nominee for the vacant seat on the Supreme Court temporarily suspended, Trump wants to shore up support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time is Trump’s election rally in West Virginia tonight and where can I watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s election rally in West Virginia online via the live video stream below on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss this week’s hearing of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which has become strained over allegations of sexual misconduct, while the Senate’s expected confirmation vote is suspended for a week for the FBI to investigate the allegations.
But the main goal of this series of rallies is to help Republicans, who face tough elections in November, gain some ground.
President Trump’s campaign said the role of these five rallies next week is to “energize volunteers and supporters while Republicans seek to protect and expand the majorities held in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Control over Congress is so important to his program that the president will travel to as many states as possible before entering the very busy campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesman, who declined to be named, told Reuters.
Scheduled to take place in Wheeling’s Wesbanco Arena, tonight’s rally could draw supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and be featured in Pittsburgh media,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the past month that Trump has visited West Virginia, where he won the election by more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the Senate of West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is leading in the polls.
“The fact that the president has come to try to propel him into the polls is not a good sign for Morrissey,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows determination and continues to fight to keep the chance for singles trials starting Sunday
After three clearly dominated sessions, Saturday afternoon’s foursome may have been exactly what the Ryder Cup needed.
The ever-oscillating pendulum of motivation is a concept invented for the sports world, but players really believe in it, especially in competitions like this.
So where is their motivation now?
“They were leading us by six points, now the gap is only four points, so we’re counting on that drop for a little bit of motivation,” Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe still has the advantage, of course, with a four-point lead, when there are twelve more points at stake.
Americans, Spieth says, feel that the game is starting to change in their favor and that there are enough reasons for encouragement, the most important of which is the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each won three out of four points.
Spieth sent the balls into the green zone with lethal accuracy, setting an example for his colleagues.
Those festive guttural howls became louder as the round progressed, especially when he scored a crucial point to bring the score back to a draw in the fourth game after he and Thomas had been led by two points after the first two holes.
The shot he won the match with at 15 was celebrated with a similar howl, a howl that makes you believe that the American team still has chances.
“You just have to focus and worry about your own game,” Spieth says.
That’s all that’s left for these players.
18 holes to make a good impression.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed revelation of the Ryder Cup.
Europe’s odd but adorable couple have won four out of four matches and can’t seem to fail.
“Moliwood” was the only pair that didn’t need any extra punches on Saturday afternoon, but that’s true for Saturday morning, and for Friday afternoon, and even for the nine points on Friday morning.
This performance and the way their energy seems to flow to and from the enthusiastic public reinforces the view that they will be the most dangerous players on Sunday. No other player would be more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari if they were to carry out a potential European victory when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably, both at the same time, in different holes.
Talks about the glory of Europeans remain premature for now.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly passed Sergio Garcia, the morning hero at the fourballs, when he teamed up with Alex Noren.
An extra shot and two doubles at the first nine holes plunged the Spaniard and Swede into a hole so deep they were not even close to getting out of it.
Sunday, however, no one will be safe.
The fourballs and foursomes samples are fascinating and worth watching closely because of the interactions between pairs, the advice given and ungiven, and the way a strategy can change on the spot.
The Europeans have played better as a team so far and have a significant advantage on the final day, but this foursome session also showed that the US team has the motivation to continue the fight, something that some, especially those in the United States, doubted.
Europe lead 10-6 on Ryder Cup final day
Europe start the last day of the Ryder Cup with a significant lead after finishing Saturday’s fourballs and foursomes with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the offensive with two wins against a hesitant Tiger Woods, which has increased their score so far at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn’s European team, trying to win back the trophy they lost to Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American players who made many mistakes at the morning fourballs and won the series 3-1.
The U.S. put up more serious resistance to the foursome, where it won two matches, but could not reduce the deficit.
Jim Furyk’s team needs eight points from 12 Sunday singles matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, and together with Molinari, a pair nicknamed “Molliwood” after a sensational weekend, they are the second pair to win four points from the four opening matches in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they leaned superbly to defeat the discouraged Woods and American rookies Bryson Dechambeau with an even clearer score, 5-4.
Woods, who struggled in both Saturday games, has had occasional glimmers of genius, but has so far lost 19 of his 29 matches at fourballs and foursomes, seven of which were back-to-back defeats.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning fourballs session, returned with partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka 2-1, positions one and three in the world.
Europe did not, however, have an unhindered journey on this pleasant and cool day in south-western Paris.
Triple major tournament winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas became the benchmark for Americans, scoring two points on Saturday.
They managed to win a 2–1 match against Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs, then came back later and defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4–3 in the foursome after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team managed to recover a four-point deficit in the singles, although because they are the current holders of the trophy, Furyk's players only need an equal result.
However, after being in second place two days in a row, a counterattack on Sunday seems unlikely.
North Korea says there is ‘no chance’ of unilateral disarmament as long as there is no trust
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the extension of sanctions would deepen mistrust in the United States and that it was impossible for his country to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the global council that North Korea had implemented "significant measures to prove its good faith" last year, such as stopping nuclear tests and missile testing, dismantling the nuclear test site and committing to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
“However, we don’t see any corresponding response from the U.S.,” he said.
“If we cannot trust the United States, we will not trust our national security capabilities, and in such circumstances, we cannot unilaterally disarm ourselves first.”
While Ri echoed North Korea’s familiar objections to Washington’s resistance to a “phased” approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded if it took gradual steps, his statement seemed significant because he did not directly reject unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a summit for the first time between a sitting U.S. president and North Korea’s leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim pledged to make progress toward a “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,” while Trump offered assurances on North Korea’s security.
North Korea sought an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
In addition, Washington has failed to heed calls to ease tough international sanctions on North Korea.
“The US insists on the ‘denuclearisation first’ option and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive way, and even objects to the ‘declaration of an end to the war,’” Ri said.
“The impression that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an illusion that only people who don’t know us have.
But the problem is that the prolonged sanctions deepen our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader referred to at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-in, the president of South Korea, over the past five months, adding: “If the denuclearization issue had been negotiated with South Korea and not with the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this impasse.”
Even in these conditions, the tone of Ri’s speech was very different from that of last year’s speech, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target US territory with missiles from North Korea after “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim a “missile-man” on a suicide mission.
At the United Nations this year, Trump, who last year threatened North Korea with “total destruction,” praised Kim for his courage in initiating the disarmament process, but said the work was just beginning and that sanctions would remain in place until North Korea was denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said there is no planned timeframe for this and added: “It doesn’t matter if it takes two or three years or five months.”
China and Russia say Pyongyang should be rewarded by the UN Security Council for the measures taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “Implementation of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without interruption until we achieve complete, final and confirmed denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions imposed on North Korea since 2006, in an attempt to block funds for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri in the corridors of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again the following month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit has not been particularly successful.
When he left Pyongyang in July, he said progress had been made, but after just a few hours, North Korea denounced that he had made "gangster threats".
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile launch pad and a nuclear complex if the United States takes “appropriate steps.”
He said Kim told him that the “appropriate measures” he was seeking were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and that he wanted a normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take courses on how to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year encourages students to sleep more, in an attempt to combat the growing macho culture that makes them undergo “all-night” learning sessions, energized with lots of caffeine.
A scientist has discovered that students at the world’s most prestigious university often don’t even master the basic concepts of how they should take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, created the course, believed to be the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to create the course after holding a conference on the impact of lack of sleep on the ability to learn.
“At the end, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why am I only being told this now, in the last year?’
She told me she had never been told about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, introduced for the first time this year, explains to students the essential concepts of how good sleep habits help improve academic and athletic performance, as well as overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding that students were seriously sleep-deprived during the week.
The one-hour course can involve a number of interactive tasks.
Within a section, the image of a dorm room is presented, and students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports pants and books to be told what the effects of caffeine and light are and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deficiency, but also about the importance of a sleep program.
In another section, participants were told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily schedule.
“We know we can’t instantly change student behavior.
But we believe that they have the right to know, just as everyone has the right to know about the health effects of smoking,” Professor Czeisler added.
The culture that makes students proud to have learned all night still exists, he says, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students have turned sleep deprivation into a growing problem.
Sufficient, good-quality sleep should be a student’s “secret weapon” for combating stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, and even for avoiding weight gain, because sleep deprivation makes the brain think the body is hungry, which makes students feel like they’re constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler create the course after attending one of his courses in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to promote a course for all students.
The next step, he hopes, is to require all graduate students to complete a similar degree program before enrolling at this fiercely competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler advised students to set an alarm to know when it’s time to go to sleep, as well as when to wake up, and to know the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LEDs, which can disrupt the circadian rhythm and cause difficulties when trying to fall asleep.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga's goal knocks out Gerrard's team
Rangers are suffering from another case of on-the-go depression because Dolly Menga's shot condemned Steven Gerrard's unconvincing team to a 1-0 loss at Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted their first away win since a 4-1 win against St. Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team managed to manage Gerrard's second loss in 18 games as coach, putting the Rangers eight points behind the Hearts, the authoritarian leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, and the uninspired Rangers players never seemed able to equalize.
The Rangers thus fell to sixth in the standings, while Livingston climbed to third, behind the Hibernian, a one-goal gap.
And Rangers may face other issues as well, as touchdown umpire Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after an object was apparently thrown from the lawn to the visiting team’s fans.
Gerrard traded eight players from the group that easily won against Ayr in the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same 11 players from Livingstone who managed to get a tie with the Hearts last week and has every reason to be proud of how his well-trained squad stifled their opponents throughout the match.
Even though the Rangers had a superior possession, Livingston used the balls they had more effectively.
He should have scored just two minutes into the game when Menga's first pass propelled Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed a very good opportunity.
A deep free kick by Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgow, sent her off the bar.
The Rangers took control, but left the impression that they were more hopeful than confident in their game in the final third of the game.
Alfredo Morelos strongly believed he should have received a penalty when he collided with Steven Lawless in the fifteenth minute of the game, but referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's request.
Rangers made only two shots on goal in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not bothered at all by Lassana Coulibaly's head or Ovie Ejaria's weak shot.
Although Livingstone’s 34th-minute goal did not live up to the trend of the game, no one can deny that it was deserved, if only for the effort put in.
Again, the Rangers failed to prevent a deep cross by Jacobs.
Scott Arfield had no reaction when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool and passed to Menga, who finished with a simple shot.
Gerrard took action at halftime, when he traded Ryan Kent to Coulibaly; this move almost paid off immediately, as the winger centered on Morelos, but the impressive Kelly stepped out of the way to block him.
But Livingston continued to draw visitors in exactly the same type of match he prefers, with Lithgow and Halkett intercepting crossover after crossover.
Holt's team could have extended their lead in the finals, but McGregor managed to block Jacobs' shot, then Lithgow headed past the corner kick gate.
Rangers reserve Glenn Middleton asked for a penalty late in the game when he hit Jacobs, but again Thomson disagreed.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page from our Sunday morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago (and counting CONTINUES...), is the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the creation of the device known as the Geiger counter.
An essential device for science since then, the Geiger counter has also become essential for pop culture, as happened in the film "The Bells of San Coronado" (1950), in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played cowboys with unlikely inclinations towards science:
Man: “What’s that?”
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you can hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: “Yes, you can hear a lot of banging!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “detect” harmful cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “detect” harmful cells and destroy them
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them in a laboratory
They can “detect” a protein common to many cancers and then are reinjected.
A test vaccine offers promising results in patients with a range of cancers.
The ovarian cancer of a woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells has been gone for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them in the lab so that they can “detect” a protein common to many cancers, called HER2, and then reinjecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Institute of Oncology in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we are dealing with a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “causes the growth of several types of cancers,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach, taking immune cells from patients and “teaching” them to target cancer cells, also worked for treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West held a diatribe of support for Trump while wearing a MAGA cap after appearing on SNL.
It didn't turn out too well.
Kanye West was booed in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a raucous show in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he plans to run in the 2020 election.
After performing the third song, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a Make America Great cap, the artist unleashed himself in a speech against the Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump.
“A lot of times when I talk to a white person, I’m asked, ‘How can you like Trump?
Well, if I had been worried about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began the show with a scene starring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star overrode Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the footage of West's diatribe was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to take West down with this post.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had problems behind the scenes because of his cap.
“They tried to intimidate me behind the scenes.
They told me, ‘Don’t go out wearing this hat.’
I was assaulted!
They also told me I had come very low," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, “Do you want to see how far down I got?” and then said, “I’m going to get my Superman mantle, because that means you can’t tell me what to do.
Try it with love.”
His comments drew booing from the audience at least twice, and members of the SNL team appeared to be embarrassed, Variety reported; one person on that team told the publication, “There was complete silence in the studio.”
West was invited as a last-ditch replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose long-time boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West raised many eyebrows when he performed the song "I Love It" dressed as a bottle of Perrier.
West was backed by TPUSA conservative group leader Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "To one of the bravest spirits among us: THANK YOU FOR FIGHTING THE GLOBAL."
Karen Hunter, host of a talk show, wrote on Twitter that West simply “was himself and that’s wonderful.”
“But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying their music or clothing or supporting their ‘art’) who I believe embraces and expresses an ideology harmful to my community.
He's free.
And so are we,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, announcing that he is now "the being officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name; West follows in the footsteps of Diddy, formerly known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, took the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the former music legend, Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then to "the artist formerly known as Prince".
Man charged with attempted murder for stabbing in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after another man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defence lawyer is expected to appear in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the Public Prosecutor’s Office.
Kit Harington, the star of Game of Thrones, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that the presentation of these roles on the screen makes the boys think they have to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he thought “something was wrong” and wondered how the issue of toxic masculinity could be handled in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married fellow Game of Thrones star Rose Leslie, who is also 31, admitted that he is “very determined” to talk about the issue.
“Personally, I’m very determined to talk about it now: where did I go wrong with masculinity?” he asked.
“What have we taught men about being adults, given the problem we face now?”
Kit believes that television could be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity through very male characters.
He continued: “What is innate and what is learned?
What do young boys learn on TV and on the street, what makes them think they have to be a certain type of man?
I think this is one of the great questions of our time: how can we change this?
Because it's clear that something has gone wrong with the young people."
In the interview, he admitted that he will not be playing in any Game of Thrones-based series after the series ends in the summer of next year, saying that he "is done with the battlefields and the horses".
Starting in November, Kit will star in a new production of Sam Shepard’s play True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that happened to him because of Game of Thrones was that he met his wife, Rose.
“I met my wife when I made this show, so it ensured my family’s future and my life from now on,” Kit said.
Rose played Ygritte, the girlfriend of Jon Snow, Kit's character in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on Leslie’s family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of Chinese citizens suffering from HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by the disease in China, officials say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted sexually, unlike those in the past.
In the past, HIV has spread rapidly in some areas of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people contracting HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials told a conference in Yunnan province.
From one year to the next, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is an acute problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is considered widespread.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men will eventually end up marrying a woman.
Many of the cases of disease transmission come from inadequate sexual protection measures in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of an effort to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee leaked data to Republican Party senators, talks about “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
Rep. Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced allegations that a member of her team posted personal information about three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat has claimed the allegations are made by analysts and “far-right” websites.
“Lies, lies and other miserable lies,” Waters said in a tweet.
The disclosed information included the addresses and personal phone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information came online Tuesday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came shortly after the three senators asked Kavanaugh questions.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of posts was associated with Waters’ office and presented the information to a member of Waters’ team, Hill reported.
“These unsubstantiated allegations are completely false, an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of the team, whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these false allegations, was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
These unsubstantiated accusations are completely false, an absolute lie.”
Waters' statements were criticized online shortly after they were made, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is furious,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that he doesn’t have the temperament to be a Member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn’t do, they don’t have to be angry.
It doesn't have to be defiant.
They should not question the motivation of the accuser.
You have to be calm and calm.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters’ reaction to that of Judge Kavanaugh, who was criticized by Democrats, who said he seemed a bit too angry during Tuesday’s hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican who is running against Waters in the midterm elections, also commented on the situation on Twitter.
"Important, if it's true," he wrote.
In his statement, Waters said her office alerted “appropriate authorities and legal entities to these false allegations.
“We will make sure that the perpetrators will be discovered,” she continued, “and that they will be held accountable to the law for all of their destructive and dangerous actions to any of my team members.”
Johnny English Strikes Again: A Spookless Parody of Spy Movies, Starring Rowan Atkinson
It has become a tradition to look for the meanings associated with Brexit in any new British film, but this does not apply to the new film in the action movie parody series that features Johnny English as the main character, the series that began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Returns.
Will this mocking satire of how weird we are become the nation’s new export opportunity?
Anyway, Johnny English, the incompetent spy with staring eyes and rubber face, has been renewed for the second time the license to spoil everything. The name of the character means, first of all, that it is a general comic creation for the cinema audience in non-English-speaking countries.
He is, of course, the unwitting secret agent who, despite his pretensions to luxury and extravagance, has a bit of Clouseau, a drop of Mr. Bean and a knife tip of the kind that contributed a single note to the Chariots of Fire theme music at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
The character is based on the explorer and mysterious man without a country that Atkinson once played in Barclaycard TV commercials, which left chaos in his wake.
This latest adventure of JE also has one or two nice moments.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in medieval armor and the rotor blades slightly hit his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is highlighted, but the humor is rather weak and, oddly, superfluous, especially since "serious" films, such as the 007 series or Mission: Impossible, confidently offer comic moments as an ingredient.
Humor seems to target kids more than adults, and to me, Johnny English’s crazy adventures aren’t as inventive and clever as Atkinson’s silent film gags when he plays Bean.
As usual, the premise has always been that the UK has serious problems.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain’s super-secret web of spies and revealed the identities of undercover British agents, much to the chagrin of the agent on duty, a regrettably small role for Kevin Eldon.
It’s the last straw for a pompous and beleaguered prime minister already suffering a serious crisis due to declining political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best with her Theresa May-like character, but the script doesn’t give her a chance to shine.
Her secret intelligence advisers inform her that all active spies have been compromised, so she must activate an agent in reserve.
This is Johnny English himself, now working as a teacher in a school for the upper class, who also gives lessons on how to be an undercover agent. Here are some cute gags, because English runs a spy academy in the style of School of Rock.
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting, then reunited with his longtime partner, Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a very enthusiastic and precious character, a role in which Vicki Pepperdine's talent is a bit wasted.
So these Batmans and Robins of troublemaking in Her Majesty’s Secret Service are back in action, facing off against the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls into the spell of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s IT problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on an odyssey of burlesque adventures: disguised as waiters, setting fire to a trendy French restaurant, creating chaos when they sneak aboard Volta’s luxury ship, then English triggers anarchy in his pure form when he tries to use a set of glasses for his familiar virtual reality home.
This last sequence is very ambitious, but no matter how cute and colorful the movie is, it seems like a television production for children.
A pretty mediocre movie.
As with the other Johnny English films, I can’t stop wondering: can’t the British film industry really give Rowan Atkinson a role commensurate with his talent?
Labour denies plans for Britons to work four days a week but be paid for five
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party would have a radical plan, according to which the British would only work four days a week, but would be paid for five days.
It seems that the party wants the heads of companies to take advantage of the possible savings due to the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution by giving employees another day off.
Thus, the employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but the salary would not be changed.
The sources say that the idea would "match" with the party's economic program, which wants to tip the balance in favor of workers.
The shift to the four-day workweek is supported by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: “An announcement on a policy review is expected before the end of the year.
It won’t happen overnight, but a four-day work week is a fitting aspiration in the party’s approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of the worker, as well as in the party’s overall strategy on industry.”
The Labour Party is not the first to back this idea; the four-day working week was one of the Green Party’s promises in the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration is not supported by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "The four-day working week is not a party policy and is not taken into account by the party."
Shadow Cabinet Lord Chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of last week’s Labour conference to describe his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he is determined to take back power from “faceless directors” and “profiteers” from utility companies.
The shadow cabinet chancellor’s plans also refer to the fact that the current shareholders of the water-supplying kings may not recover their shares in full, because the Labour government could collect “deductions” due to established offences.
He also confirmed plans to appoint workers to company boards and create ownership funds to hand over 10 per cent of private sector companies’ equity to employees, who will receive annual dividends of up to around <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy reveal on '60 Minutes' whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh would change their minds
The FBI’s investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his candidacy for Supreme Court justice by at least a week and raises the question of whether Republican senators could be persuaded not to support him because of the FBI’s findings.
In an interview aired Sunday, “60 Minutes” correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find information that would change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more willing to do this than his South Carolina colleague.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
“I’ve been saying this since the beginning of the hearings; I’ve been talking to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when this happened, when the charges came up, and I asked him, “Are you guilty?”
The answer was decided, promptly, unequivocally."
Graham’s vote, however, seems to have been carved out of stone.
“I’m determined about Brett Kavanaugh, so there would need to be some explosive charges,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I do know this: Brett strongly denies the allegations,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“None of the people named by her confirmed the report.
And it happened 36 years ago.
I doubt anything will change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it managed to do something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event attended by an impressive group of stars, with an equally impressive mission: the elimination of global poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will draw tens of thousands of people to the Central Park lawn, not only to watch artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the true purpose of the event, the elimination of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (unless they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), viewers had to pay for a series of tasks or “actions,” such as volunteering, sending emails to world leaders, making phone calls, or other significant things that help raise awareness of the global goal.
But how successful was the Global Citizen Festival when there are only 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a good way to get them to act, or is it just another case of so-called “clicktivism,” a concept that refers to people who feel they’ve accomplished something by signing an online petition or sending a message on Twitter?
According to Global Citizen, since 2011 there have been more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters, who have promoted different goals.
The organization says these actions have spurred world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group was talking about 390 commitments and announcements caused by its actions, on the account of which at least 10 billion dollars have already been spent or collected.
The group estimates that the funds secured so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and intermediaries committed to “helping children grow to their full potential,” which promised to provide Rwanda $35 million to help eliminate malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 Twitter messages from global citizens.
“With the help of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition just a footnote in the book of history,” Tracey Ullman, the Power of Nutrition’s ambassador, told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were carried out in the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced it would fund The Power of Nutrition project, which will provide nutrition interventions for 5 million women and children.
The answer to one of the most common questions on their website: “What makes you think you can eliminate extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen responded: “It will be a long and difficult road, sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights or anti-apartheid movements that took place before us, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists who will perform at this year’s event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use naval forces for a “blockade” that would make it harder for Russia to export energy, says Home Secretary
Washington can, “if necessary,” turn to naval forces to prevent Russian energy from reaching certain markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said.
Zinke argues that Russia’s engagement in Syria, in particular where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I think the reason they're in the Middle East is because they want to broker energy sales, as they do in Eastern Europe and southern Europe," he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and methods to manage the situation.
“The United States has the ability, through our naval forces, to ensure that sea lanes are open and, if necessary, to create a blockade, so that energy doesn’t go to market,” he said.
Zinke addressed attendees at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that declares itself the “voice of the energy consumer” in the US.
He went on to compare how Washington interacts with Russia and Iran, showing that the approach is virtually the same.
“The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, the use and replacement of fuels,” he said, saying Russia “knows only one trick” because of its fossil fuel-dependent economy.
The statements come at a time when the Trump administration is trying to increase liquefied natural gas exports to Europe to replace Russia, the much cheaper option for European consumers.
In this regard, representatives of the Trump administration, including President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inadequate" project of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which, according to Trump, would turn Berlin into a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which will double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin said the U.S. fierce opposition to the project is driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we look at it the same way: energy cannot be a tool to put pressure on and consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” Alexander Novak, Russia’s energy minister, said after a meeting with Rick Perry, the US energy secretary in Moscow in September.
The US position drew criticism from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s main industrial organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US not to interfere in EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem with the fact that a third state intervenes in issues regarding our energy,” Dieter Kempf, president of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren 'thinks seriously' about running in 2020 presidential election, Massachusetts senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she must "think seriously" about running for president after the midterm elections.
During the town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering a candidacy.
“It’s time for a woman to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that takes a strong woman,” she said.
“After November 6, I will seriously consider running for president.”
Warren also had something to say about President Donald Trump during the town hall meeting, saying that he “turned the country in the wrong direction.”
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren was a vocal critic of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, Trump’s nominee for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said “normally we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that most of Warren’s voters don’t think he should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run, according to a poll conducted by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent of respondents support such a candidacy.
The survey showed more support for a candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick: 38% of respondents support a potential candidacy of him and 48% are against.
Other names of well-known Democrats who could run in 2020 include Vice President Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, the senator from Vermont.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin talks about the post-traumatic stress disorder that Track Palin suffers from, at a Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
On Monday evening, he was arrested and charged in a domestic violence case.
“The things that my own son is going through, that he went through after he came back ... I can understand the suffering of other families who are feeling the ramifications of PTSD and the aftermath of the wounds that our soldiers are coming back with,” he told the audience gathered at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said her son and other war veterans "turn a little different, tougher, they come back wondering if there's any respect for what they and their soldiers in the armed forces and the air force, and all the other members of the military, have done for the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, preventing the reporting of an act of domestic violence, and possessing a firearm while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a Wasilla police department spokesman.
18 states and the District of Columbia challenge new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims trying to escape gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District filed an amicus brief Friday in Washington to support a challenge to the asylum policy, NBC News reports.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit that the American Civil Liberties Union initiated in August against federal policy was not disclosed.
She said her partner "and his violent sons, members of a gang" abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum request on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state-appointed lawyer representing Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which have produced large numbers of asylum seekers in the U.S., as nations facing a widespread problem with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board that allowed undocumented immigrants trying to escape domestic violence to seek asylum.
District Attorney General Karl Racine said Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal and international law.”
“Federal law says that all asylum claims must be adjudicated on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a limitation violates this principle,” the amicus curiae petition reads.
In addition, the lawyers argue in the application that the policy of denying entry to immigrants affects the U.S. economy, saying that immigrants are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary labor force.”
Jeff Sessions, the U.S. attorney general, in June ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims trying to escape abuse and gang violence.
“Asylum is granted to those who leave their country driven by persecution or fear because of discrimination based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a social group or because of a political opinion,” Sessions said on June 11 when he announced the policy.
The role of asylum has never been to solve all the problems that people face every day in the world, not even all the serious problems.
Desperate rescue operations in Palu, where the death toll has doubled, in a race against time to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation became increasingly dire.
“The situation seems very tense,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother who is nursing her fever-stricken baby at an evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
Ambulances bring bodies all the time.
“Drinking water is not enough.”
Residents began to return to their destroyed homes and organize their flooded goods, trying to save everything that can be saved.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale, were overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered fractures to his spine and shoulder, are resting outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients are being treated in the open due to strong and continuous aftershocks.
He has eyes full of tears when he remembers how he felt the violent earthquake shaking the hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I was trapped in the ruins of the wall, I think,” Haris told The Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife scream for help, then just silence.
I don’t know what happened to her and my son.
I hope they are safe."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of 'Abusing' Propaganda
A week after an official newspaper in China ran a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper praising the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using the U.S. media to distribute propaganda materials.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the supplement paid by China in the Des Moines Register, Iowa's top-selling newspaper, after accusing China of meddling in the Nov. 6 congressional election, a charge that China rejects.
The accusation that Beijing is trying to meddle in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials told Reuters is a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to run ads promoting trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a growing trade war that involves waves of tariff hikes on imports.
The tariffs imposed by China in retaliation at the start of the trade war were designed to hurt exporters in states like Iowa that backed Trump’s Republican Party, experts in China and the United States said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor in Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businessmen.
In an editorial published Sunday in the Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote that China “continues this abuse by publishing propaganda advertisements in our own free press.”
“When disseminating propaganda through the publication of an ad in the Des Moines Register, the Chinese government is disrespecting America’s cherished tradition of free speech and a free press,” Branstad writes.
“In contrast, at the street newsstand here in Beijing you will find few dissident voices, and you will see no real reflection of the divergent views that Chinese citizens have about China’s worrying economic trajectory, given that the media is under the control of the Chinese Communist Party,” he writes.
He added that "one of the most important newspapers in China refused to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper it was.
Republicans alienate female voters ahead of midterm elections over Kavanaugh scandal, analysts warn
With many of the top Republicans backing and protecting Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh from multiple sexual abuse allegations, analysts have warned that there will be a backlash, especially from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions created by this scandal have been extremely strong, and most Republicans who have publicly discussed it intend to continue voting.
“Such reactions will not be forgotten,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake’s (Arizona’s representative) last-minute initiative on an FBI investigation will appease the angry electorate.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget tomorrow and they will not forget in November,” Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group, told the Washington, D.C., newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted “November is coming!” as they demonstrated in the halls of the Senate when Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee chose to continue the Kavanaugh nomination process despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be very high,” Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst for the news site, told the New York Times.
“People say they were already very big and that’s true.
But it could be even bigger, especially among the undecided suburban female voters and the young electorate, between the ages of 18 and 29, who, while they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony, in which he detailed the allegations of sexual abuse brought to the Supreme Court nominee, analysts were suggesting that a backlash could follow if Republicans continue the confirmation process.
“This has turned into a mess for Republicans,” Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the committee vote or the final vote or the possibility of Kavanaugh being confirmed, but it’s also about how the Republicans handled this situation and how they handled it,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, an electoral support group for Democrats, told the news channel.
Still, Americans seem to be relatively divided about what part they should believe after Ford’s and Kavanaugh’s testimony: a little more seem to believe the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents strongly believe or believe Ford’s testimony is likely to have been true, while 35 percent said they strongly believe or Kavanaugh’s testimony is likely to be true.
In addition, 38 percent said Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s initiative, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other person, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Last week, Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh had drunkenly abused her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee exposed his genitals to her while attending a party while they were students at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to set up a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on Solid, Berners-Lee’s open-source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has the right to access the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt is “global domination.”
“Now we have to do it,” he said of the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own “personal online data archives” or PODs.
It may contain contact lists, schedules, calendars, music libraries, or other personal and professional tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available in one browser, all at once.
What is unique about this online personal data archive is that the user has complete control over who can access this type of information.
The company calls this “personal consolidation through data.”
According to company CEO John Bruce, the idea is for Inrupt to contribute the right resources, processes and skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a team of developers working on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team aren’t talking to “Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change when their business models are completely messed up all of a sudden.
“We don’t ask their permission.”
In a Medium post on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of a new Internet on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the Internet neutrality debate.
Even after launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic for this next era of the Internet,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: the clergyman who won the Victoria Cross in the First World War is celebrated
The only cleric of the Anglican Church to win a Victoria Cross medal as a combatant in World War I was celebrated in his native town after 100 years.
Lieutenant-Colonel Bernard Vann won the medal on 29 September 1918 in the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew that he had been awarded Britain's highest military honour.
A memorial stone was unveiled Saturday by his two grandchildren during the parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of the grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was “wonderful symbolic” that the stone would be unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather won the medal.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very heavy fog and under the intense fire of artillery and machine guns".
Later, he hastened to the front line and, with "fantastic bravery", opened the way for the soldiers, then attacked a nest of artillery himself and managed to eliminate three of the detachment's weapons.
Lieutenant-Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I can never match, but it makes me feel humbled.”
He, along with his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid down a wreath after the parade, which was conducted by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said he "feels very honored to play a role in the parade" and added that "the value of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that a lot of people give him."
MMA fans stayed up all night to see Bellator 206, but received cartoons featuring Peppa Pig instead.
Imagine you’ve been up all night watching Bellator 206, a star-studded event, just so you can’t watch the main event.
The San Jose event schedule contained 13 fights, including six on the main panel, and was to be broadcast live throughout the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi was preparing to face Rory MacDonald, viewers in the UK were stunned when the broadcast was replaced with an episode of Peppa Pig.
Some were not satisfied at all, because they stayed up all night to watch the fight.
A fan on Twitter described the move to children's cartoons as "kind of a bad joke".
“Government regulations say this content is not suitable for 6 a.m., so they had to switch to children’s programming,” Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president for marketing and communication, said when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig, yes."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said that in the future, they will schedule their events in such a way that they can also be watched by spectators in the UK.
“When I think about reruns, I think we could probably sort it out,” Coker said.
“But it’s six in the morning on a Sunday here and we won’t be able to do that until Sunday, our time, or Monday, their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed, I started getting a lot of text messages and they were not all friendly.
We tried to fix the situation, we thought it was a technical mess.
But it wasn't about that, it was about government regulation.
I can promise you it won't happen again next time.
We’re going to do five fights instead of six, like we usually do. We tried to give the fans more, and we pushed the envelope.
This is an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" because of his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but this motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize until he got to school that “not everyone is like me.”
Invited to Lauren Laverne’s first ever Desert Island Discs show on Radio 4, he said he talks about gay rights to give others “hope.”
He also said that when he became a parent, he cared less about the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the regular host of the tradition show, will be missing a few months due to illness.
Invited to the first edition presented by Laverne, Daley said that when he was a child he felt "inferior" to others because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls as well."
He said: “So far, these feelings of inferiority, and the fact that I felt different, were the real things that gave me the strength and stamina to achieve success.”
He wanted to prove he was “someone,” he said, so as not to disappoint everyone when they finally learned about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medal winner became a prominent supporter of LGBT campaigns and took advantage of his appearance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to urge more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he decided to speak out because he felt lucky to be able to live freely, without consequences, and because he wanted to give others “hope.”
The three-time world champion said he was "taken by surprise" by falling in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black.
Daley last year married the Oscar-winning filmmaker, who is 20 years his senior, but said the age difference was never an issue.
“When you go through so much at such a young age” – he attended the first Olympics when he was only 14, and his father died of cancer after three years – he said, it’s hard to find someone of the same age who has gone through the same good and bad times.
In June, they became parents to a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, which, Daley says, changed his “whole perspective.”
“If I had been asked last year, I wouldn’t have been interested in anything other than winning a gold medal,” he said.
“You know what? There are more important things than gold medals at the Olympics.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die and that one of the last things he wanted was to find out if they had received tickets for the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to be in the first place.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘You’re not going to be able to be first, Dad,’” he said.
“I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and only after he stopped breathing and died did I finally accept that he was not invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“I knew that’s what I’ve dreamed of all my life, to jump in front of the spectators in my country at the Olympics, there is no more beautiful feeling,” he said.
This also inspired him in the music of his choice, Proud by Heather Small, a song that encouraged him before the Olympics and still moves him.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15.
Mickelson, out of shape, was put on the bench on Saturday in the Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Saturday when he plays in the 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to get back into good shape to make sure this isn’t an unfortunate occasion.
Mickelson, who is playing in the biennial event for the twelfth time, another record, was put on the reserve bench by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday’s fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he has often been for the United States team, the five-time major-tournament winner split his day between being a cheerleader for teammates and practicing his shots, hoping to right what went wrong.
The 48-year-old has never had the straightest drives, even at the best time of his career, so he’s not the best choice for the narrow course at Le Golf National, where long rough areas often punish incorrect shots.
And if the field isn’t big enough, in Sunday’s ninth game Mickelson will take on Francesco Molinari, the meticulous British Open champion who teamed up with rookies Tommy Fleetwood and won all four of the week’s matches.
Mickelson’s game could prove absolutely crucial for the Americans, led by four points at the entrance to the 12 singles matches, which must begin in force at this stage.
Furyk said he was confident in his player's ability, but he couldn't have said anything else anyway.
“He completely understood the role he had today, he tapped me on the shoulder, he hugged me and told me he would be ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has contributed greatly to these teams in the past and this week.
I didn’t expect him to play in two games.
I imagined more, but that’s what happened, and that’s the way I thought we should do it.
He wants to play like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games played.
This could be the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, which has not risen to the level of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, though Furyk said his presence brought some intangible advantages to the team.
“He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, he’s smart, he likes to joke with the players, he’s a great guy in the locker room,” he said.
“I think the young players are having fun playing with him, it was fun to see them doing that during the week.
His role is more important, it’s not just about the game.”
Team Europe captain Thomas Bjorn knows the considerable advance could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the Europeans, knows from experience that the considerable advance held before the first day of singles trials in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable journey.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, when the team led by captain Seve Ballesteros led the Americans by five points, but barely managed to defeat them by a minimum difference of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 to 131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“I remember having a considerable lead at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we barely managed to win,” Bjorn said after watching the 2018 team win 5-3, both on Friday and yesterday, and now lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
“So history shows me and my team that it’s not ready yet.
Tomorrow we have to play at full speed.
Let's go out on the field and do everything perfectly.
The game is not ready until the points are passed on the table.
We have a goal and that is to win this trophy, it must remain the goal.
We have always said, we need to focus on the 12 players in our team, but we also know what awaits us on the other side: the best players in the world.”
Delighted with the way his players handled difficult terrain, Bjorn added: “I’m in no rush to draw conclusions.
Tomorrow is a completely different situation.
Tomorrow individual performances are important, and this is different.
It’s great to be on the field with a partner when things are going well, but when you’re on your own, then you’re tested to the max as a golfer.
This is the message that you have to send to the players, that you have to be in the best shape tomorrow.
Now they leave their partner behind and they have to play as well as they can.”
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk, the captain of the opposing team, hopes that his players will play better in the singles than they did with the partners, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself was on both sides of such comebacks on the last day: he was on the winning team at Brookline, then on the losing team when Europe achieved the “miracle of Medina”.
“I remember every word,” he replied when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, was able to encourage his players before the final day.
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow and we would like to start with some quick wins, like at Brookline, like at Medina.
When inertia develops in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on those midfield matches.
We created our match and ordered the players as we would like, you know, we’re trying to create a little bit of magic tomorrow.”
Thomas has been tasked with leading the fight: he will face Rory McIlroy in the main event, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the second half of the programme.
“I chose this group of players in that order because I think it covers all the topics,” Bjorn said of the singles lot.
Germany's New Warship Delayed Again
Germany’s newest naval frigate was supposed to be commissioned in 2014 to replace aging Cold War warships, but that won’t happen until next year because of faulty systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The entry into service of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg frigate class, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quotes a military spokesman.
The vessel was supposed to be introduced to the maritime forces in 2014, but problems arising after delivery have affected this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships that the Navy ordered in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
It is assumed that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, with a range of anti-aircraft and anti-vessel missiles, as well as stealth technologies that ensure a low radar, infrared and acoustic footprint.
Other important features will include longer maintenance periods; it should be possible for the new frigates to leave on two-year missions without returning to the original port.
However, the continued delays mean that these state-of-the-art warships, which are said to enhance Germany’s maritime strength, will already be obsolete before they enter service.
The unlucky frigate F125 was discussed in the press last year when the German Navy officially refused to take over the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the builder after delivery.
Not much information is available about the reasons for the refusal, but German media cited a number of crucial "software and hardware flaws" that would have made the warship useless on a combat mission.
The software flaws were especially important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, only half of the crews on the older Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, the ship was found to be far too heavy, which reduced its performance and limited the Navy's ability to add future equipment.
The 7,000-ton ship Rheinland-Pfalz is believed to be twice as heavy as the ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty mechanisms, and the price of the entire project, including that of crew training, became a cause for concern.
It is said to have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) from the initial price of 2.2 billion euros.
The problems of the newest frigates take on special importance given the latest warnings that Germany’s maritime power is waning.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defense committee in Germany’s parliament, admitted that the Navy “began to run out of ships that can be sent on missions.”
The official said the problem has grown steadily over time as old vessels have been decommissioned without being replaced with new ones.
He lamented that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates had entered service in the Navy.
National Trust Spies on the Secret Lives of Bats
New research being conducted on a Scottish Highlands property aims to reveal how bats use the environment to hunt their prey.
It is hoped that the findings will reveal new things about the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help future conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will look at common dwarf bats and pygmy bats, as well as eared bats and water bats from Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed in key locations around the property to track bat activity throughout the season.
The NHS team and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
Specialized audio analysis of all recordings will estimate the frequency of sounds made by bats and what species emit certain sounds.
A habitat map and report will also be produced to create a detailed, scaled-up picture of their behaviour in the environment.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation consultant for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as creating lawns, and what is the best way to maintain forest meadows for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined considerably over the past century.
They are endangered by construction and development work affecting their nests, but also by habitat loss.
Wind turbines and public lighting are also risks, as are fly traps and some chemical treatments for building materials, as well as attacks from domestic cats.
Actually, bats are not blind.
However, because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to accurately identify insects and obstacles on their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, is thinking very seriously about bats.
They have ten trained experts, who periodically carry out surveys, control nests and sometimes carry out rescue missions.
The organisation has even created Scotland's first and only bat reserve, on the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of Scotland's ten bat species are found.
Estate manager David Thompson says this is ideal territory for bats.
“Here at Threave, the area is great for bats,” he says.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and a perfect habitat.
But there’s a lot we don’t know about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand why they need to breed.”
It stresses the importance of looking for bats before performing maintenance work on properties, because simply unintentionally destroying a maternal nest could kill up to 400 females and offspring, which can destroy the entire local population.
Bats are protected, and killing, harassing or disturbing them, as well as destroying their nests, are prohibited actions.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official with the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help them.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about bats and we don’t know how populations evolve for many of our species.”
Ronaldo denies rape allegations as lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has said the charges against him are "fake news" and that some people "want to advertise" using his name.
His lawyers are determined to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The Portugal and Juventus striker was accused of raping an American woman, identified as Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that the footballer paid her $375,000 not to talk about the incident.
Hours after the allegations were published, in a video streamed on Instagram Live to his 142 million followers, Ronaldo, 33, said they were “fake news”.
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said in front of the video camera.
“They want to advertise using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by using my name, but I'm used to that.
I’m a happy man and everything is fine,” the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have called “an inadmissible reporting of suspicions relating to privacy,” according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz says the player will seek compensation for “moral damages equivalent to an appropriate amount for the seriousness of the act, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in an apartment at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a club, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he raped her anally, according to documents filed with the district court in Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that, after the incident, Ronaldo fell to his knees in front of her and told her that he was "a good boy" in the proportion of "99%", and that he was betrayed by that "one percent".
The document claims that Ronaldo confirmed that he had sexual relations with the accuser, but that they were consensual.
Mayorga claims she turned to police and that photos of her injuries were taken at the hospital, but she later accepted a plea deal outside the courtroom because she was "terrified of the possibility of revenge" and worried she would "be publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman is now seeking to cancel that deal because she continues to be traumatized by the incident.
At the time of the alleged attack, Ronaldo was about to transfer from Manchester United to Real Madrid. This summer, he was transferred to the Italian giant Juventus, after a transaction worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain would ‘regret’ the loss of carmakers
Britain would “regret forever” if it lost its status as the world’s leading automaker after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, where Toyota’s Auris and Avensis brands are manufactured, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will stop at our plant,” Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s chief executive, said in a statement.
Other UK automakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have said they fear leaving the EU without a deal on cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, says that after Brexit, it will close the Oxford plant where the Mini is produced for a month.
The main concerns are created by what manufacturers call supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line operates on the “fix on time” principle: for custom-made cars, parts arrive at 37-minute intervals from UK and EU suppliers.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, border problems could arise, which industrial manufacturers say could cause delays and a shortage of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than one day’s inventory at its factory in Derbyshire, the company says, so production would be halted.
Clark said May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "accurately calibrated to avoid these delays at the border".
"There has to be an agreement. We want to have the best agreement, which will allow us not only to enjoy the success of the present, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
“The evidence from not only Toyota but other manufacturers shows that we need to be able to continue to use what has been a very successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota could not say how long production would have to stop, but warned that higher prices could reduce the plant’s competitive capacity in the long term and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the head of the United Union at the factory, said members are increasingly concerned: “Experience has taught me that after they disappear, these jobs don’t come back.”
A government spokesman said: "We have created an accurate and credible plan for the future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, White House says
Donald Trump’s high-level meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed for another week” as the fight for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein is overseeing special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump’s aides and Russia, and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Rumors of Trump firing the deputy attorney general, jeopardizing Mueller’s independence, have been circulating in Washington circles for months.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of suspending the president through the 25th Amendment to the US Constitution.
Rosenstein denied this report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, and reports say he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced for Thursday with Trump, who was at the United Nations headquarters in New York at the time.
Trump said he would “prefer not to” fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump called for a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, which again delayed a vote in the Senate.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “It may be this week or it may be delayed by a week, taking into account all the other things that are happening now in the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see and I always like to keep the press up to date.”
Some reporters would dispute this claim: Sanders had no press briefing at the White House since Sept. 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the reduction in the number of briefings was not caused by antipathy to TV reporters, who like to show off, though he added: "I don't deny that they like to show off."
Then, he suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
“The president attends more question-and-answer sessions than all previous presidents,” she said, adding without mentioning any evidence: “We looked at the numbers.”
"There will be more briefings," Sanders said, but "I think it's much better that the press has the opportunity to ask the questions directly to the president of the United States, not to me.
We try to do this most of the time, and you can see that we have done this many times in the last few weeks, and discussions with the president of the United States will replace press briefings when it is available.”
Trump usually answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences given exclusively by him are rare.
This week in New York, the president demonstrated why this is happening, having an impromptu, sometimes bizarre, appearance in front of assembled reporters.
A State Secretary at the Ministry of Health has written to EU employees at the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland about Brexit concerns.
The Secretary of State has written to EU employees working at the NHS branch in Scotland to express his gratitude on behalf of the country and his wish that they remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent the letter with less than six months to go before the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already committed to bear the costs for applications to receive permanent resident status for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the withdrawal have continued, with decisions expected to be taken this autumn.
But the UK government has started to prepare more and more for a different scenario, in which there would be no agreement to leave the EU.
I know this is a very stressful time for you.
For this reason, I want to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues in the European Union and beyond have valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and also benefit the patients and communities we serve.
You can consider Scotland your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering a blow to the head
Tennessee State Tigers defender Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury on Saturday in a match his team lost to Vanderbilt Commodores 31-27, Tennessee's Mike Organ said.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the strike occurred shortly before the break.
“It got to the line and it just collapsed,” Reed said.
Abercrombie was put on the oxygen mask by the physical trainers and medical staff on the line before he was placed on a stretcher and transported off the field for a thorough evaluation.
A Tennessee State representative told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had recovered from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details yet on the type/extent of the injury" and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when it occurred.
Abercrombie, a student in Year 2, is in his first season at Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
On Saturday, he managed to do five tackles in total before leaving the match, reaching a total of 18 tackles throughout the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher judicial stamp duty when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will pay a higher judicial stamp duty when buying a property in the UK, with the extra money to be used to help the homeless, according to new Conservative Party plans.
This change will neutralise the success of Corbyn’s efforts to attract young people with the right to vote.
The judicial stamp duty will be applied to non-taxpayers in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher court stamp duty rate when buying a property in the UK, and the extra money will be used to help the homeless, as Theresa May is due to announce today.
The change will be seen as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract young people with the right to vote, by promising cheaper homes and targeting high-income people.
The higher judicial stamp duty will be applied to individuals and legal entities that are not tax payers in the UK, and the additional money obtained in this way will be used to support the Government’s efforts to help the homeless.
The surcharge, which is added to the current judicial stamp duty, including the levels raised two years ago for the second property and properties purchased for rental purposes, could reach a value of 3%.
The Treasury expects this change to add up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
Around 13% of newly built properties in London are bought by non-residents in the UK, which leads to rising prices and makes it difficult for those who want to buy their first home.
Several prosperous areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend much of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the judicial stamp duty to help young people buy their first home.
He accused major construction firms of keeping property prices high as a result of buying land without using it, and called on Theresa May to drop taxes on affordable homes in order to solve Britain's "house problem".
Corbyn has announced a number of attractive real estate reform proposals, including rent controls and an end to unmotivated evictions.
It also wants to give councils greater powers when it comes to building new homes.
Theresa May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my prime ministership to fulfilling the British dream of a better life for every new generation.
And this means to remedy the existing problems in the real estate market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not fair that people who do not live in the UK, as well as companies based abroad, can buy homes as easily as hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has become far too distant, and living in undignified conditions is far too real.
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to be Scotland's national team manager"
Jack Ross, manager of the Sunderland football team, said his "ultimate goal" was to become, at some point, manager of Scotland's national team.
The 42-year-old Scot is enjoying the challenge of "reviving" the northeastern club, which is currently ranked 3rd in the Premier League, with a three-point gap to first place.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after last season's return of the St. Mirren football team to the Scottish Premiership.
“I wanted to be a member of the national football team, but as a player.
We made it to the national B team and that's it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
“But I spent much of my childhood watching Scotland at Hampden with my father and always wanted to come back.
But I will only have this opportunity if I succeed as the club’s manager.”
Ross' predecessors as managers of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former club manager Alloa Athletic said he was not thrilled to be the successor to such established names at such an important club, having turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“The only thing that concerns me and that could affect my success is the question ‘Can I help this team get back to the Premier League?’
"There is no doubt that the structure and facilities at this club allow him to be in the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not easy to get her there, but I think the only thing that would make me feel like a successful man is to contribute to the club’s return to the Premier League.”
Ross has only three years of management experience, after a stint as assistant manager at Dumbarton and another 15 months spent as a member of the Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa recover after relegating to the C division and managed to save St. Mirren from relegation, helping the team win the championship title the following season.
Ross said he feels better now than in his entire playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was a decisive moment,” he said of taking over the management of Alloa.
“I really thought I fit the role of manager more than the player.
Maybe it sounds strange, because we had a good period, we were winning well and we had a few successful moments.
It’s hard to be a player.
You have to do a lot of things and repeat them weekly.
I face similar situations as a manager, in terms of stress and pressure, but I feel it’s the right role for me.
I’ve always wanted to be a manager and now that I can do that, I feel like it’s the right thing for me in my entire adult life.”

This summer’s heatwave has led to an increase in revenue in UK pubs, but putting more pressure on restaurant chains.
According to figures, pubs and bars saw a 2.7% increase in July, while restaurant revenues fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, CGA’s business consultancy, who conducted the survey, said: “The consistent heat and England’s participation in the World Cup over a longer period than expected contributed to a pattern in July, similar to the previous month, when pubs had up to 2.8 per cent more customers, while restaurants had a longer period.
The number of fewer customers by 1.8% in the restaurant industry in June decreased even more in July.
Pubs and bars that only serve drinks have recorded a much higher profit than restaurants.
Pubs serving food have also experienced heat losses, but not as high as those in restaurants.
It seems that people went out to the city just to drink.
Beverage sales at all bars and pubs increased by 6.6 percent this month, and food saw a drop of 3 percent.
Paul Newman, representative of RSM, which provides services in the hospitality industry, said: “These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Weather conditions and the impact of large-scale sporting and social events remain among the most important factors contributing to sales associated with the OOH advertising market.
It is not surprising that restaurants continue to record losses, although the 4.8% year-on-year drop in sales will add to the current cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food industry operators and only time will decide whether the more moderate temperatures recorded in August will bring better news."
Total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the reduced number of newly launched locations.

One in five children has a secret account on a social network that they hide from their parents
According to a survey, one in five children, some as young as 11, has a secret account on a social network that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 middle school students revealed an increase in “fake Insta” accounts.
The news has raised fears about posts with sexual content
20% of students said they have a “principal” account that they show to parents
One in five children, some as young as 11, create an account on a social network that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 middle school students revealed a rapid increase in “fake Insta” accounts, referring to the Instagram photo-sharing platform.
The news has raised fears about posts with sexual content.
20% of students said they have a “principal” and “clean” account that they show their parents, but they also have other private accounts.
A mother who accidentally discovered her 13-year-old daughter’s secret account noticed a teenager’s post asking to be “raped.”
According to research by the UK-based company Digital Awareness and the HMC (Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference) of independent schools, 40% of 11-18 year olds have two profiles, and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
HMC director Mike Buchanan said: “It’s alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces that parents and teachers don’t have access to.”
Eilidh Doyle to be ‘Voice of Athletes’ on Scottish Athletes’ Commission
Eilidh Doyle was elected as the non-executive director of the Scottish Athletes’ Commission at the governing body’s annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland’s most decorated track and field athlete, and Ian Beattie, the president, described the change as a great opportunity for those making decisions about the sport to take advantage of the vast experience it has gained internationally over the past decade.
“Eilidh enjoys respect throughout the community of athletes from Scotland, the UK as well as around the world and we are confident that Scottish athletes will benefit significantly from his inclusion on the committee,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I am delighted that I will be able to represent the athletes and I hope to make a real contribution and help the way sporting activities are carried out in Scotland.”
The American-born athlete, who won the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Games, in addition to the four gold medals she won at the Olympics, is now a frequent commentator on the BBC, having suffered a transient ischemic attack.
She wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me that only time will decide if I will recover or to what extent.
It was a titanic job, but I completely recovered, I learned to walk again, and today I do agility exercises!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!”
A breast pump ad comparing women to cows divides public opinion online
A breast pump company has caused public opinion to divide online with an ad comparing breastfeeding mothers to milking cows.
To mark the launch of a pump that aims to be “the world’s first silent, wearable breast pump,” consumer technology company Elvie has launched an ironic ad, inspired by a music video, to showcase the freedom the new pump offers breastfeeding mothers.
Four real moms dance in a barn full of cow hay to a song that includes lyrics like, “Yes, I’m milking, but I don’t have a tail” and “If you haven’t noticed, these aren’t ugliness, but my breasts.”
The refrain goes on: "I pump, pump, suckle the baby, pump, pump, pump the milk from the girls."
However, the ad, posted on the company’s Facebook page, has sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has been the subject of mixed reactions from those who have viewed it, many of whom say it exposes the “horrors” of the dairy industry.
“It was a very bad decision to use cows to promote this product.
Like us, they must remain pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their children are stolen only a few days after birth,” one person wrote.

Another person commented: “It’s understandable how traumatic it is for both the mother and the child.
Of course, why not use them to promote a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added, “An extremely inappropriate advertisement.”
Other people defended the ad, with one person saying he thought it was a "hilarious" ad.
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I would have bought one if I was still breastfeeding.
The pumping really made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little off, but I took it as such.
But the product is brilliant," one person wrote.
Another person commented: “It’s a funny ad targeting moms who use the pump (often at work or in the toilet) and who feel like ‘vacuums’.
It’s not an ad that praises or judges the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the group of women reveals that they danced with discreet pumps inserted into bras.
The concept behind the campaign is that many women who use the breast pump say they feel like cows.
But the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and discreetly fits into a nursing bra, giving women freedom of movement, the ability to hold their children in their arms and even go out on the town while using the pump.
Ana Balarin, partner, consultant and developer in design at Mother commented: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves such a bold and challenging launch.
Comparing breastfeeding mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight the challenges of using a breast pump and present, in a fun and real way, the incredible feeling of freedom that the new pump will give.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has hit the front page.
During the presentation of fashion designer Marta Jakubowski at London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the podium while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children have been secretly transferred to a refugee camp on the Texas border.
The number of detained migrant children has increased, although the number of people crossing the border each month has remained relatively the same, largely because the rhetoric and harsh policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to place children with sponsors.
Typically, many sponsors are undocumented immigrants themselves and fear they will jeopardize their stay in the country if they apply to take on children.
The risks increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors, as well as other adult family members, must register their fingerprints and that their data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs enforcement official, told Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who asked to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
“About 80 percent of people who are sponsors or family members of sponsors are living in the country illegally, and a large part of them are foreign criminals.
That means we will continue to look for those individuals," Albence said.
To speed up the process of processing children, authorities have introduced new rules that require children to appear in court one month after detention, rather than 60 days as the previous standard required, according to shelter employees.
Many will plead the case through a video call, and not in person before an immigration judge, to apply for lawful resident status.
Those deemed ineligible will be deported immediately.
The longer children remain in custody, the more they can become restless or depressed, which can lead to violent reactions or attempts to escape, according to shelter employees and reports issued by the system in recent months.
Lawyers said these concerns are heightened at a larger unit, such as Tornillo, where there is a possibility that signs indicating a child has problems are not observed because of the size of the unit.
They added that transferring children to refugee camp without giving them enough time for emotional preparation or to say goodbye to friends could cause them trauma, which many of them are already suffering from.
Syria calls for US, French and Turkish military forces to withdraw immediately
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also urged Syrian refugees to return home, even though Syria has been at war for eight years.
Moualem, who is also acting prime minister, said foreign military forces were in Syrian territory illegally under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that "the situation will be properly managed."
“They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions,” he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that “the war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have been uprooted from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "this sacred struggle until we remove terrorist groups and illegal foreign presence from all Syrian territories."
There are about 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Kurdish and Arab forces in Syria that oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
Also in the war-torn country there are more than 1,000 French military troops.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said conditions were right for their return and accused "several Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears", prompting the refugees to keep their distance.
He added: “We have asked for the support of the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return.”
“Political influence is being brought into an issue that should be purely humanitarian.”
The United States and the European Union have issued warnings that they will not support reconstruction in Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition on ending the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a demilitarized zone in the Idlib region to drive out the last group of rebels has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement helped avert a large-scale assault by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement has "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that the military action will target jihadist groups, including those on the Nusra front, which have links to the Al-Qaeda network and which "will be eradicated".
Staffan de Mistura, the United Nations envoy, hopes to meet soon in a first meeting of a new committee made up of members of the government and opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem outlined the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the committee's activities should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and issued a warning about interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
If we were to follow this logic, Trump would be re-elected in 2020, unless the impeachment procedure or scandals end his term as president sooner, which a large part of the liberal audience hopes will happen.
In this case, it would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic end to a presidential term of office of all time!”
So far, it seems that the audience is still interested in the subject.
Since 2014, prime-time audiences have doubled on CNN to 1.05 million and nearly tripled on MSNBC to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, in prime-time, Fox News is watched, on average, by 2.4 million people, compared to four years ago when it was watched by 1.7 million, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" recorded a record audience, with 3.5 million people watching it in the evenings when important news was broadcast.
“This is a subject that appeals to the public because we can’t understand it,” said Neal Baer, the producer of ABC’s drama “Reserve President,” about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after a catastrophic attack on the Capitol building.
Nell Scovell, a comedy writer with extensive experience in the field and the author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride through Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
“He said, ‘Because it makes me laugh,’” Scovell told me.
In chaos, entertainment is harnessed.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the action in Washington could determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, whether immigrant families can be made whole, and the state of the global economy.
Changing the position is a luxury that only the privileged public can afford.
However, you’re not just an informed citizen when you get to the sixth hour of watching the debate by a panel of experts on how Bob Woodward uses “deep background” sources for his book, “Fear,” about the $15,000 ostrich leather jacket of The Paul Manafort.
I will never look at Super Mario in the same way again.
“A lot of what he does feels like you’re watching a reality show and he feeds you topics every night,” said Brent Montgomery, executive director of media group Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the show “The Pawnbroker’s Aces,” about the constantly changing cast and the daily twists of Trump’s “Kim” (triggering a fight with the Professional Football League).
You can’t afford to miss an episode, because you’ll feel like you’ve fallen behind.
When I went to visit Mike Fleiss this week at his house on the northern shore of Kauai, outside it was 27 degrees and it was sunny, and he was sitting inside watching MSNBC and recording from CNN.
He could not get out of the television, especially as Brett Kavanaugh was to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was to be decided.
“I remember doing some unusual shows in the past, and people would say, ‘This is the beginning of the end for Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was a joke, but they were right.”

Overwhelming external financial resources for the tightest midterm elections associated with the House of Representatives
As a result of a realignment of electoral districts, resulting in two incumbents running for the same office, it is hardly surprising that Pennsylvania’s 17th electoral district enjoys overwhelming financial resources.
Thus, the new suburb of the Pittsburg district brought the Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won, in another district, the special elections last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents Pennsylvania's 12th electoral district, which significantly overlaps with the 17th.
The electoral maps were reconfigured after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were not constitutional, with district boundaries manipulated in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the 17th new electoral district triggered a competition in campaign finance between major party funding bodies, the Congress Committee for the Campaign of the Democrats (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in a special, high-stakes election held in March for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
For more than a decade the office was held by a Republican, and President Donald Trump won in this district by a difference of 20 points.
According to political commentators, the Democrats enjoy a slight advantage.
The U.S. considered penalizing El Salvador because of its deal with China, but then gave up
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Trump had a welcoming meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners evacuated the Trump Organization’s leadership team.
State Department officials have decided to call U.S. heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama following “recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan,” department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But sanctions were considered only against the state of El Salvador, which received about $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for narcotics control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included financial aid cuts and visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high rate of unemployment and crime.
As domestic meetings progressed, officials in North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to continue a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from being routed to the United States.
But by mid-September, administration officials made clear they wanted to continue the conference, effectively ending any review of sanctions on El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to address the conference, scheduled for mid-October, wanting to highlight the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three U.S. ambassadors returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without receiving any new harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman for John Bolton declined to comment on details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations only if they remain anonymous.
Their reports were corroborated by an external analyst, who is a close associate of the administration and who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
The study of history
The next thing that could happen is Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on President Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, of which there is now solid evidence made public.
Mueller is also reportedly directing his investigation into the existence of a plot between the Trump campaign and Russia over the attack on the U.S. election.
If Congress changes, Trump will face accountability within the body, even as he prepares to appear before voters and possibly a jury of his peers.
There are many possible situations, and I do not want to suggest that a Trump “fall” is inevitable, which is also true for his counterparts in Europe.
There are choices that all of us on both sides of the Atlantic must make and which will decide the length of the investigation.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to stage a coup against Hitler, only if the West opposed him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and thus lost the opportunity to avoid the years of massacre that followed.
The course of history depends on such critical moments, and the inexorable march of democracy is hastened or delayed.
Americans are facing some such critical moments right now.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since it was reported in this newspaper that last year he suggested secretly recording the president and speculated about his incompatibility with the role of president.
Rosenstein said the Times report was incorrect.
“How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation regarding Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or correct or if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will have a long winter.
But I don’t think we will fail, after the lesson we learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew of Czechoslovak origin who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy residence.
He survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to light Sabbath candles on the swastika table.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Rangers player Graham Dorrans is optimistic about Rapid Vienna
On Thursday, Rangers will be the host team for Rapid Vienna, knowing that victory in the Austrian match, after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G of the European League.
A knee injury did not allow midfielder Graham Dorrans to play this season until a 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use this result to their advantage to achieve better performances.
“It was a good point for us, given that Villarreal is a good team,” the 31-year-old said.
“We started the match thinking we would get a good result and we won a point.
We probably could have scored in the end, but overall I think the tie was a fair result.
I think they were better in the first half and we were better in the second.
On Thursday, it will once again be an important evening for Europe.
With a little luck we will get three points, but it will be a difficult match, because they had a good result in the last match played. However, having the support of the fans, we will surely feel even more motivated and we will have a positive result.
Last year was clearly a difficult one, given my injuries and the changes at the club, but the situation is better at the moment.
The team is good and the guys really like to be here; the training is also going well.
Hopefully we will persevere, we will leave behind what happened last season and we will have good results."
Women suffer from insomnia due to retirement savings.
Despite the fact that survey participants clearly knew how they wanted to be cared for, few people talked to family members about it.
About half of the people who participated in the Nationwide study said they were talking to their husband or wife about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t initiate this conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance company Nationwide.
Here's how you can get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to provide the care you need if you don’t make your wishes known in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how you will receive care, as these choices could be a significant factor in determining costs.
Involve your financial advisor: your financial advisor can also be of real help in paying for these expenses.
Your financing choices for long-term care may include a standard long-term insurance policy, a mixed cash life insurance policy to help you cover these expenses, or you can insure your own well-being – as long as you have the money.
Put your legal documents in order: you come to meet legal problems.
Obtain a medical decision-making power of attorney to appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that health care professionals respect your wishes if you can’t communicate them.
Also, consider making a power of attorney regarding your financial resources.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your invoices are paid if you do not have the necessary capacity to do so.
Don’t forget the small details: imagine that an elderly parent of yours has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about his medications and allergies?
Write these details down in a written plan to be prepared.
“And it’s not just about the financial side. Can you tell who the doctors are?” Martin asked.
“What are the medicines?
Who will take care of your dog?
Make a plan for all of this.”
A man has been shot several times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle as he walked home from a night in the city.
The victim, aged 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police officers described the incident, which took place at 2:30 a.m., as "random shooting."
The victim was unable to see his attacker.
The injuries did not put his life in danger, and police called for witnesses to testify.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck Indonesia's Palu on Friday, according to authorities, and the death toll is expected to rise.
Due to the disruption of communications networks, disaster authorities were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the provincial capital of central Sulawesi, which lies at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi, with a population of about 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating 40 years of existence when it was hit by the tsunami and earthquake.
Donggala is a regency that stretches along a coast with an area of more than 300 km in the northwest of Sulawesi island.
The Regency, an administrative region that lies below a province, has a population of about 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture activities are the focal point of the province's economy in central Sulawesi, especially the Donggala coastal region.
Mining activities for nickel are also important in the province, but are mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Management Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
Also in 1996, a tsunami hit the western part of the Donggala Regency, causing the deaths of nine people.
Indonesia is in the Pacific Ring of Fire, an area of intense seismic activity.
Here are some of the earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004 – On December 26, a powerful earthquake off the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them from Aceh.
2005 – A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of the island of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck the south of Indonesia's most populous island, Java, triggering a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009 – A 7.6-magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale occurs near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale struck one of the Mentawai Islands off the coast of Sumatra, triggering a tsunami up to 10 meters high that destroyed dozens of villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: A low-intensity earthquake occurred in the Pidie Jaya regency of Aceh, causing damage and panic as people remembered the devastating 2004 earthquake and tsunami, which resulted in a large number of deaths.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people were killed by the collapsed buildings.
2018: Several powerful earthquakes occurred on the tourist island of Lombok, causing the deaths of over 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded under rubble.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on violence charges.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and was involved in a domestic violence complaint and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is in police custody at the Mat-Su unit, awaiting trial, and is being held on a $500 bail-free bond, according to KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, declaring himself "100% innocent" when asked for a plea, according to the network.
Palin is facing three counts of class A offenses, meaning he could be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with a class B crime punishable by one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been accused of such a crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with violence against his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is pending in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, being involved in a domestic violence crime claim and possessing a gun while intoxicated in connection with an incident.
According to his girlfriend, he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin came under fire from veterans groups in 2016 after her son’s violent behavior was linked to post-traumatic stress disorder he suffers from after serving in Iraq’s military.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of people killed
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and telecommunications networks are damaged and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The quake struck off the central province of Sulawesi, which lies northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
There are videos on social media showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore.
U.S. Attorney Seeks Death Penalty for New York City Terrorist Suspect
The New York federal prosecutor's office wants the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people, a rare punishment that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a rented Home Depot truck to carry out an attack on a bike lane on the West Side of Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and cyclists on his route in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed the eight victims and “intentionally” caused serious bodily harm, according to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty, filed in New York’s Southern District.
Both charges can receive a death sentence, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts that include eight counts of murder in support of organized crime, typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and premeditation", prosecutors said, describing Saipov's execution as "heinous, cruel and depraved".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, suffering and loss to the families and friends of the following individuals: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last trial of a capital punishment case in New York's Southern District.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last capital punishment in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, two husbands executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, an Uzbek citizen, showed no regrets in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators he was pleased with what he had done, according to police.
Saipov told authorities he felt inspired to carry out the attack after looking at ISIS videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
According to the police, he asked to fly the ISIS flag in the hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to all 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the public defenders who represented Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
“We believe that the decision to impose the death penalty, instead of accepting a life-imprisonment plea with no possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all those involved,” Patton said.
Saipov's defense team has previously asked the prosecution not to apply the death penalty.
A member of parliament who is part of the Conservative Party argues that Nigel Farage must be at the forefront of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage has vowed to “mobilize the civilian army” during a protest at the Conservative Party conference.
The former UKIP leader said politicians should "feel the pressure" from eurosceptics, following a statement by a member of Parliament Theresa May who suggested he should be at the forefront of negotiations with the European Union.
Peter Bone, a Conservative MP, said at a demonstration in Birmingham that the UK “would have come out” by now if Farage was Secretary in the Brexit campaign.
But May’s challenge to the deeply divided camps was accentuated by members of the Conservative Party joining another protest against the city’s withdrawal from the European Union.
The prime minister is trying very hard to ensure that his compromise plan, the so-called Chequers plan, is carried out properly, facing attacks from those who support leaving the European Union, those who want to stay in it, as well as from the European Union.
The allies stressed that she would continue to try to strike a deal with Brussels, regardless of the consequences, and would force the Eurosceptic and Labour Party to choose between her offer and "chaos".
Bone said at the pro-Brexit Leave Means Leave event in Solihull that he wanted to "give up the Chequers plan".
He suggested that Farage should be part of the team and be given the responsibility associated with the negotiations with Brussels.
“If things were run by him, we wouldn’t be in the European Union,” he said.
The Conservative Member of Parliament, the representative of the Wellingborough constituency, added: “I will support Brexit, but we must abandon the Chequers plan.”
Referring to his opposition to the European Union, he said: “We have not fought in world wars to be servile.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone denied suggestions of a change in public opinion at the 2016 vote: "It is not at all true that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the Union."
Andrea Jenkyns, a member of the Conservative Party who supports Brexit, was also at the demonstration and told reporters: “I just want to say this: Madam Prime Minister, listen to people’s voices.
“The public does not agree with the Chequers plan, the opposition will not vote for it, our party does not agree with it, nor do our activists who go out and support us, first of all, in the elections.
Drop the Chequers plan and start listening."
In a message targeting Theresa May, she added: “Prime Ministers who keep their jobs are the ones who keep their promises.”
At the rally, Nigel Farage said politicians should be put in a position to “feel the pressure” if they are about to give up on the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“It’s a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They are trying to betray Brexit and we are here today to tell them that we will not let them do that.
He added: “I want you to help us put pressure on our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
“We are mobilizing the civilian army of the country that brought us victory in Brexit and we will not give up until we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, supporters of staying in the European Union marched through Birmingham ahead of a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small group of activists held up banners reading “Conservative Party Against Brexit” after the group’s launch this weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party, laughed at members of the Conservative Party and the security issues they faced in the party's application at the start of the conference.
“These are the people who are telling us that they can deploy IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus plus plus, for the digitization of customs procedures, for free and unrestricted trade in Ireland,” he added.
“It is a farce.
“Brexit does not bring any benefits,” he added.
Warren plans to seriously think about running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would seriously consider running for president after the November election.
According to the Boston Globe, the Democratic senator from Massachusetts spoke on Saturday about her future during a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, a Republican House member who was co-chair of Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She has been at the center of speculation that she could beat Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was the 36th meeting of eligible citizens using the city hall format since Trump took office.
One participant asked her if she was going to run for president.
Warren responded that the time had come for “women to come to Washington to solve the problems of our badly affected government, and that includes having a woman at its head.”
A suspect has been arrested in the case of the death that caused the death of the player Sims from the LSU team
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, announced Saturday that a suspect had been arrested in the case that caused the death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at an ET news conference at 11:00 a.m.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying the man in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
“Wayde Sims was shot in the head, causing his death,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told 247sports on Saturday.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was at the scene, that he was in possession of a weapon, but also that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into police custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 1.98-foot-tall junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games, being 10 times in the starting lineup last season and playing an average of 17.4 minutes, with 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins world title after his team helps him win against Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that orders from the Mercedes team would play a key role in the race.
Standing first in the standings, Bottas had a good start and nearly beat Hamilton, defending his position in the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to stop boxing and left Hamilton at the tail of the group, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes stopped at the pit stop one lap later and came from behind Vettel, but Hamilton managed to move forward after several schemes that forced the Ferrari driver to leave the interior free after making a double move to defend at the third corner.
Max Verstappen started the race on the back row of the carriage and was in seventh place near the end of the first lap, on the day he turned 21.
He then took the lead for much of the race, aiming for a quick finish and trying to overtake Kimi Raikkonen and take fourth place.
He eventually stopped boxing on lap 44, but could not increase his pace in the last eight laps, with Raikkonen remaining in fourth place.
“It was a difficult day. Valtteri did an exceptional job all weekend and behaved like a real gentleman, letting me pass in front.
And the team did an excellent job to get the win against Ferrari and to achieve this double,” said Hamilton.
Terrible body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein on Saturday at a rally over her insistence that she did not facilitate the "leaking" of Christine Blasey Ford's letter, which accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, commenting instead that what is happening in the Senate has shown people to be “bad, immoral and liars.”
“The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that happens in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and evil and immoral and liars,” he said.
“When you see that they published and leaked information and then they say they didn’t do it.
They're not responsible.
Do you remember?
When I asked Dianne Feinstein if she facilitated the “leak” of the document?
Do you remember her answer? She said: umm..here we go?
Uh... no.
I didn't do that."
Well, wait a minute.
No, we didn't," he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter detailing allegations against Kavanaugh by Ford in July and was “leaked” in September, but Feinstein denied that the “leak” occurred from her office.
“I did not conceal the allegations concerning Ford, and it was not I who facilitated the ‘leaking’ of her story,” Feinstein told the committee, according to the Hill newspaper.
“He asked me to keep it private, and that’s exactly what I did.”
But her denial doesn’t seem to have gone down well with the president, who commented during Saturday’s rally: “To be honest, it was terrible body language.
“Maybe she didn’t, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing the defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested Democrats use the allegations to achieve their own ends.
“They are determined to take power in any way possible.
Notice the wickedness, the immorality, they don’t care who they hurt and who they have to destroy to get power and control,” the president said, according to the website Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars win 5-3 over Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee’s Stars paid for Friday’s Elite League loss, winning against the Belfast Giants in Saturday’s return match with a score of 5-3 in Dundee.
The Giants had a two-goal lead with Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied the score before Dwyer brought the Giants back to face the opposing team.
Francois Bouchard matched Dundee's score before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals secured their victory.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's players, who had regained ground by beating Dundee 2-1 on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giants winning their last three games.
Dwyer's opening performance was triggered in the fourth minute, 3:35, by a pass from Kendall McFaull, then David Rutherford passed decisively to Beauvillier who doubled the team's lead four minutes later.
In a match that began so dynamically, Sullivan brought the host team back into the game in the 13:10 minute, before Matt Marquardt gave Cownie the opportunity to score for a draw in the 15:16 minute.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead before the first half, when he scored his second goal at the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard again equalized with an impressive goal in the 27:37 minute.
Later in the second half, Cownie and Charles Corcoran helped Nielsen to a lead for Dundee for the first time in that match, thus ensuring the team's climb to 5th place in the standings midway through the last half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will host Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller has died after taking off a plane carrying hundreds of passengers during an earthquake.
An Indonesian air traffic controller is considered a hero, dying after ensuring the safe take-off of a plane carrying hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a powerful earthquake rocked Sulawesi island on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
There have been several strong aftershocks in the area and many people are trapped under the remains of Palu city.
Although his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the control tower of the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu, which was shaking heavily.
It remained in place to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, would take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the air control tower when he noticed that it was about to collapse.
He died later at the hospital.
A spokesman for Indonesia’s air navigation service provider said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News Australia.
I've prepared a helicopter to transport him from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he passed away this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“We are saddened by this news,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, with the national disaster management agency saying access is limited in the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"We believe the number will increase because many victims are still under ruins and we have not had access to many of them," agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
Waves up to six meters high devastated the city of Palu, with a joint funeral to be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute, an ambulance brings victims.
It is almost impossible to find drinking water.
All the mini-markets are robbed."
Jan Gelfand, director of Indonesia’s International Red Cross, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will find on the ground.
It’s already a tragedy, but it could get worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the national army: “Please work day and night to carry out all evacuation operations.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was rocked earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now says a person is missing after a plane crashed into a lagoon
The airline that owned the plane that crashed into a Pacific Ocean lagoon in Micronesia has now said one person is missing, having previously said all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that a male passenger had been missing since Saturday afternoon.
She said she was trying to find the man, along with local authorities, hospitals and investigators.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional passenger details, such as age or nationality.
They used the local boats to retrieve the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
On Friday, authorities said seven people were taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained at the hospital on Saturday and all were in stable condition.
It is not yet known what caused the accident and the exact order of events.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane missed the runway and ended up in a lagoon near it.
Some witnesses believe that the plane passed the end of the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had reached a very short distance from the ground.
“It’s a very good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and other passengers managed to cross the water, which had reached the waist, and reach the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also said the flight attendants panicked and screamed and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby to renovate a wharf jumped to the rescue, using an inflatable boat to ferry people to shore before the plane sank 30 meters (30 feet) underwater.
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in PNG-registered airline accidents over the past two decades, but none of them included an Air Niugini plane.
An analyst presents the chronology of the night in which a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, prosecutors wrapped up their plea deal for a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman to death in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert witness in information analysis.
He presented to the jury how he used mobile phone footage to piece together the actions of 29-year-old Quinton Tellis as well as those of his victim, 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett said she received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she was killed, contradicting her previous claims, according to the Clarion Ledger newspaper.
The moment the data came out that his cell phone was with Chambers when he said he was with his friend, Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was called into the witness box and confessed that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked Tellis if he told the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he "lied because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis stated that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Cell phone records indicate they'd known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact details from his phone.
“He erased it from his life,” Hale said.
According to the schedule, the defense will begin its final pleading on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the jury to decide at the end of the day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop music trio wants to change the negative way hip-hop music is seen, with the help of positive-messaging songs.
The High Breed, based in Bristol, claims that hip-hop has stopped delivering political messages and addressing social issues as it originally did.
They want to go back to their roots and make hip-hop conscious to be popular again.
A recent revival of artists such as The Fugees and Common has been observed in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
A New York nanny is suing a couple for firing her after she received a “racist” text message.
A New York babysitter is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after she accidentally received a text message from her mother complaining that she was “still a person of color.”
The couple denied they were racists, saying she sued them for "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed dissatisfaction when she learned that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she showed up on her first day at work in 2016.
“NUUUUU! STILL A PERSON OF COLOR,” Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After realizing the blunder, Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice, stating that the nanny, who is African-American, had not performed her duties properly and that she had expected to receive a nanny of Filipino nationality, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for the day’s work and sent home with Uber.
She now sues the couple for severance pay and demands $350 a day for six months, the period she was supposed to live with them and carry out her work, despite the fact that this was done without a contract.
“I want to show them that they don’t do such things,” she told the Post newspaper on Friday, adding, “I know it’s about discrimination.”
The couple denied claims that they were racist, saying it was normal to fire Maurice because they feared they could no longer trust her after they had offended her.
“My wife sent him the wrong message.
He's not a racist person.
We are not racist people,” Joel Plasco, her husband, told the Post.
“But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you’ve wronged, even if by mistake?
The newborn baby?
Let's be serious."
Calling the trial an “extortion” action, Plasco said his wife will be born in two months and is in a “very difficult situation”.
“Do you really want to take revenge on a person in such circumstances?
This is not the case,” added the banker.
While the trial is ongoing, public opinion has accused the couple on social media, judging them for their behavior and logic.
Editors of Paddington’s story feared readers would not be able to identify with a talking bear, according to a new letter.
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book’s acceptance, said of the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time before it’s published.
It's very funny now, after seeing that Paddington has had huge success."
She said her father, who was a cameraman for the BBC before he was inspired by a toy bear to write the children's book, would have been optimistic about the rejection of his work, adding that the 60th anniversary of the books' publication was a "sweet-bitter" after he died last year.
About Paddington, whom she describes as “a very important member of our family,” she added that her father had a low-key pride in his later success.
“He was a pretty quiet man and didn’t like to brag,” she said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was like having a kid who had a hit: you’re proud of him, even though it’s not your hit.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although it was his creation, based on his imagination, he always used to give Paddington credit."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye over the phone
Upon landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“Nad called frequently to tell me it was very serious and that he didn’t think he would survive,” Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I got a call from Nad telling me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And that's exactly what I did.
I said, “Tashi, my dear, I love you very much.
We'll be together soon.
I'll join you.
The effect of the drugs given by the doctors to keep her heart pumping blood was beginning to diminish and to leave her body.
He had died a short time ago and the organs were beginning to stop working.
I had to sit there and wait, aware of everything that was going on.
I couldn’t scream or scream because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to control myself."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, mourning the death of his daughter, boarded the plane, along with other passengers, who did not know what he was going through.
“No one knew,” she said.
“I kept my head down and the tears wouldn’t stop flowing.
It’s hard to explain, but during the flight I had an overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
I knew he needed love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Two grieving women place various messages on a bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who have lost their loved ones to suicide are trying to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place various messages on a bridge in Wales, many of which are motivational and include phone numbers to which people can call for support.
Sharon Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
Davis, 45, lives in Lydney and says his son was going to be a promising cook with a contagious smile.
“Everyone appreciated his smile.
They always said his smile changed your mood."
However, he gave up work before he died because he had reached a very unhappy time in his life.
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after taking his own life.
Davis said, "I keep thinking you're going to have a domino effect."
She created the messages “to let people know that they can call someone or talk to someone, even a friend.
Get out there, you need to talk to someone.”
Kelly Humphreys, Davies' longtime friend, lost Mark, her 15-year-old partner, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t tell me he wasn’t feeling well or that he was depressed,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, I noticed that his attitude had changed.
He was in a deplorable state on Christmas Day when the kids unwrapped their presents and he didn’t even look them in the eye.”
She said his death was a huge trauma for them, but they must overcome it: “It caused immense pain within the family.
We're devastated.
But we have to go ahead and fight.”

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is at stake as the Federal Bureau of Investigation begins its investigation.
“I thought if we could get something similar to what he was asking for — a limited-time, small-scale investigation — we might have a little bit of unity,” Jeff Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the commission was about to “disintegrate” amid a partisan standoff.
Why didn’t Kavanaugh and his Republican backers want an FBI investigation?
Their reluctance is entirely due to the time factor.
There are only five weeks left until the Nov. 6 election - if, as expected, the Republicans have poor results, their attempts to place the one they want as the winner in the country's highest court election will be significantly weakened.
George W. Bush has repeatedly appealed to senators to persuade them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and through whom he met his wife, Ashley, Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI finalizes the report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to make a difference in a tie and confirm it at the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean fugitives dwindles under Kim
The number of North Koreans fleeing to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea's unification ministry, said last year about 1,127 people fled the country, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the key factors were tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs levied by those illegally transporting people across the border.
Pyongyang has not made any public comment.
A vast majority of the fugitives from the north are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul officials say more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two sides of Korea.
China considers migrants to be illegal rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still practically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for several talks on denuclearization negotiations.
This came after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed, in general terms, to work together for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused U.S. sanctions of causing a lack of progress since then.
“If we cannot trust the United States, we will not be able to trust our national security, and in such situations, we will not be the first to unilaterally disarm,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi describes Brett Kavanaugh as “hysterical,” saying he is incapable of serving on the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the Democratic minority in the House of Representatives, described Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh as "hysterical" and said his temperament was inappropriate for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments Saturday in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t help but think that if there was a woman in this situation, she would have been declared ‘hysterical,’” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied allegations that he sexually harassed Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and losing his voice due to emotions, while discussing his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned Democrats on the committee, calling the charges against him “a grotesque and coordinated character assassination,” organized by angry liberals that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh’s testimony has shown he cannot serve on the Supreme Court because he has shown a bias against Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and with the way he attacked the Clinton family and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi deviated from the point when asked if she would try to suspend Kavanaugh if he was confirmed and if Democrats would win a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I just want to say this: If he’s not telling the truth in front of Congress or the FBI, then it’s not appropriate, not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court he’s in right now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaugh’s possible rulings against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case because he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh ignored the question of whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
“It’s not the right time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, ‘Wow, how wonderful!’”
And women need to be able to handle it.
It’s justified diatribe, there are months and years of accumulated anger, and he can’t speak without bursting into tears.
“We cry when we get angry,” Gloria Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s unusual, do you?”
She continued: “I received significant help from a woman in an executive position, who told me that she also cried when she was nervous, but that she developed a technique whereby, when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, ‘You might think I’m sad, because you see me crying.
I'm nervous."
And then it goes on.
I thought it was a brilliant thing."
Tears are allowed for the exteriorization of anger, partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of the clearest memories from one of my first jobs, in a male-dominated office, where I began to cry because of inexpressible anger, is that I was grabbed by the back of the head by an older woman, a cold headmistress whom I always felt a little afraid of, and she took me to the stairwell.
“I never want to see you cry,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
I think you're sad and they're going to be glad you got that feeling."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democrat in Congress in Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in the presidential election.
In 1987, when Hart was caught having an extramarital affair on a boat called Monkey Business and retired from the race, Schroeder, extremely frustrated, thought she had no reason not to run for president herself.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she says with a laugh, 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone referred to the situation as "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Because the campaign was nearing its end, she was behind in fundraising and swore she would not enter the race if she failed to raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found out that some of her supporters who had given the men $1,000, they were only giving her $250.
“Do they think I’m getting discounts?” she asked.
During the speech in which she announced that she would not officially launch a company, she was so affected by the emotions – as a result of the gratitude for the people who supported her, the frustration caused by the system and the fact that it was so difficult to raise money and target voters instead of delegates, but also the anger caused by gender discrimination – that she lost her voice.
“You would have thought I had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalls of the media’s reaction to her.
“You would have said that one of my sponsors is Kleenex.”

How can the US-China trade war benefit Beijing?
The salvos that heralded the start of the trade war between the United States and China have been deafening, and while it appears to be a long way to go, the feuds between the two countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, issued the first warning earlier this year, imposing tariffs on key imports from China, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation came this week with new tariffs affecting $200bn (<0xC2><0xA3>150bn) worth of goods, effectively taxing half of all goods from China entering the United States.
Beijing has retaliated each time, most recently imposing a tax of between 5 and 10 percent on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods.
China has warned that it will respond to every blow from the United States, and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economy will take a step back in the near future.
For Washington to withdraw, China must agree to its demands, but publicly ceding to the United States would be far too humiliating for Xi Jinping, China’s president.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards right, U.S. pressure on the trade war could support China positively in the long run, reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick policy decision taken in Washington or Beijing could lead to an economic collapse in both countries would in fact be more dangerous than what has been expected so far,” said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher focusing on Asia at the Center for New American Security, an expert group.
Syria is ready for the return of refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild the country ravaged by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
During his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country was improving.
“Today, the conditions on the ground are more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by the terrorists so that things return to normal.
The existing conditions allow for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they have been forced to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures targeting their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since war broke out in 2011.
Six million people who continue to live in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that conditional assistance or aid from countries sponsored by the insurgency would not be accepted.
European team wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup after defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National on the outskirts of Paris, France.
The United States have now recorded their sixth straight European win and have not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe returned to first place after the team led by Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored 14.5 points, needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who put incredible effort into much of the tournament, sent the ball from the initial shot in the water to the 3rd hair from the 16th hole, yielding the match to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari has performed incredibly well in all four rounds, becoming one of only four players with a 5-0-0 result since the current tournament format was introduced in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth lost in the 5th and 4th holes to Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
World No. 1 Dustin Johnson lost in the 2nd and 1st holes to Ian Poulter of England, probably his last Ryder Cup match.
A Ryder Cup veteran who has participated in eight editions, the Spaniard Sergio Garcia, has become the player in Europe with the most victories, recording an average of 25.5 points in his entire career.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help myself.
It's been a rough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm extremely happy that I was able to win the cup again.
It’s a team effort and I’m glad I could be of help,” Garcia said excitedly after the European victory.
He hands over the baton to his countryman, John Ram, who defeated Tiger Woods, an American golf legend, in holes 2 and 1, at the individual game on Sunday.
“I’m very proud to have beaten Tiger Woods. I used to watch his matches when I was a kid,” said Rahm, 23.
Woods has lost all four matches in France and now holds a 13-21-3 record at the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, who won 14 major titles, being surpassed only by Jack Nicklaus.
All weekend, the American team made a real effort on the golf course, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played extraordinarily throughout the tournament.
Team USA captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance by his team: “I’m proud of them, they really tried.
This morning, there were a few moments where I put pressure on the European team.
I had a tough fight.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played well.
I will work with the PGA of America and our Committee for the Ryder Cup and we will move forward.
I love these 12 boys and am proud to be their captain.
We must give them due respect.
They played better than us.”
