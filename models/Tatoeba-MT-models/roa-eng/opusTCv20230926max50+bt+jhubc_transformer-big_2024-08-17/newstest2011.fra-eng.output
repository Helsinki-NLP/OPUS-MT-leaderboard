What's going to happen? CSSD doesn't know Voldemort or pastry in Prague.
The newly elected CSSD councillors in the capital will apparently have to overcome a real language barrier to understand each other at the municipal council level with their old and new ODS colleagues.
The daily Actualne.cz "tested" the new members of the municipal council belonging to CSSD, namely whether they know the argot that was born in recent years in the town hall, when it was the partners of the current coalition who ruled in Prague.
The coded vocabulary that the Prague political cream set in motion during the previous era of Mayor Pavel Bem describes some of the personalities, situations, and causes of the metropolis.
It was with surprise that it was discovered that the newly elected do not understand very well the terms known.
At least they say so.
"Who is Valdemort?"
"I really don't know."
"I'm a young man in Prague politics," Lukas Kaucky, the culture's choice, said in a test of the "godfather" vocabulary.
And as for the veteran politician, elected Karel Brezina reacted in the same way.
For example the meaning of "golf hole".
"That's the only expression you're offering me that I'm using."
Otherwise, I don't use the arg<0xC3><0xB4>t.
From the vocabulary, whose expressions were published by the daily Aktualne.cz in June of this year before the pre-eectoral congress of the ODS, the editorial staff chose 6 examples, with priority given to those related to the Prague City Hall.
The socialists had to explain the meaning of "Voldemort", "the biggest golf hole in Prague", go to the patisserie", "beef nerve", "betrayal of the capital" and "enlist".
Three of the elected officials agreed to the quiz, the fourth - Antonin Weinert, who is to lead education in Prague in the future - promised first an interview but then did not pick up the phone.
The fifth elected Petr Dolinek outright refused the test.
"I don't care at all about these things and how the representatives of citizen democracy have fun: I will not give my opinion."
"I am currently dealing with how we will understand each other as part of our programs," he said.
As we have already heard, the elected Lukas Kaucky would apparently not recognize in the above legend, that it is the influential Janousek on the entrepreneurs and friends of the former mayor Roman Bem.
"Voldemort" says nothing to Kaucky and the only expression he guessed in the test is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
“This is the Blanka tunnel,” Kaucky said, adding immediately, “But I know it from the newspapers.”
“I’m going to have to pay for a language course,” he jokes.
Not only the matador Karel Brezina but also Lukas Plachy, the chosen for the environment, know that the golf hole is the Blanko tunnel.
The two Social Democrats know who Voldemort really is and Lukas Plachy knows where to find the character - he thinks of the meaning of "going to the bakery".
"It's, I think, about going into a company," Plachy is ready to guess that this is the headquarters of the Janousek companies.
On the same tone Brezina recalls that he draws his knowledge rather from newspapers and not from any vocabulary he would use.
According to the candidates for the tests there is no argot lexicon in social democracy.
“I’ve consulted with colleagues and it appears we really don’t have something like this.”
“We call ourselves names, but sometimes we use abbreviations and symbols,” says Peter Hlinsky, president of the Social Democratic Party, which party members call Hulda.
“I was called Briza at school but I don’t know if my colleagues call me that,” Brezina said.
The daily newspaper Actuel.cz tested the name and it works.
The elected Weinert is Papy for the members of the Party or the less friendly Petit vieux, the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to him before the elections by scams during the sponsorship of the party, is nicknamed "the little toy".
The nicknames are also the only ones that the Social Democrats admit to using within the party.
It seems that Hulinsky does not much like to hear Hulda, but the daily Akutel.cz has recorded another nickname for this Prague president.
"Doctor of truncheon law" apparently recalls that Petr Hulinsky obtained his title of doctor of law JUDr. at the police academy of Bratislava.
The government wants to reduce the torture of "witches", published a brochure.
In Burkina Faso, women declared witches have common traits.
Rather, they are part of the older generation, for example, unable to work for health reasons, are free and have no children.
The one who becomes a "witch" is isolated so as not to threaten the rest of the village.
“Man very rarely has this destiny.”
“Nor are we judging young women in good health because they participate in work and give birth to children,” says a sister who works in the capital of this West African country, Burkina Faso, in a special institution of more than 100 women who have been rejected by society.
The local government decided to intervene against this unusual "social measure".
He edited a brochure that should help limit witch-hunts.
There's a "hic" in the case.
“More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso cannot read,” warned the daily Die Standard about the drawback of written education.
The accusation of witchcraft is common in other African countries.
In Ghana, neighboring Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemma, a 72-year-old woman died after being tortured by three women and a man and then burned with oil they had sprayed her.
The BBC server relayed this information.
Criminals say it was the evil eye.
According to their version, the oil that is used for ritual anointings has ignited on contact with the woman.
The oil ignited, it is said, when the team wanted to "chase the evil spirit" of the woman.
The isolation of "witches" is approved by people of all levels of education.
The daily Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: “Human spirit eaters have always been a danger,” he says.
While Burkina Faso is working to reduce the witch-hunt, the Gambia has seen the President himself take part in it as recently as last year.
"The Gambian President Dzammi, after the death of his aunt, launched a wide-ranging witch hunt which, it seems, would have participated in his death and would have tried by black magic to kill the President as well."
“Shamans from nearby Guinea have come to the rescue and brought to the presidential farm in Kanilai, under the protection of police and the President’s personal guard, men and women randomly selected from villages in The Gambia,” Amnesty International said in a statement.
On the farm the imprisoned people had to drink a potion made of plants with hallucinogenic effects that caused in addition to other effects on the kidneys and intestines.
Two prisoners did not survive.
On the international pressure it is about a thousand people who were released.
Bakal's tenant: The stoves are heating up, he signed a higher rent.
An imposing elderly man walked out the door of the Byty RPG company's customer center from the "coal baron" Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of apartments for rent in the Czech Republic.
He was carrying under his arm a file with three new leases for three apartments: his own, that of his daughter and his son who is serving a sentence.
Deregulation has increased the rent for these three people.
Instead of paying 3500 the son will have to pay from next year for a 2+1 apartment of second category 4100 crowns.
“And there is no hot water and the heating runs on solid fuel,” points to his son’s new contract the man who has the power to sign.
"But I signed it anyway," he explains, half angry and half resigned.
The citizen association of apartments BytyOKD.cz, which described the new rental conditions as "immoral and indecent", advises tenants not to sign and wait until December 7, when a notice will be published to explain the method to follow to claim.
But man reacts to this with a gesture of the hand.
"One says that, the other says something else" frowning.
The Ostrava region becomes the laboratory of deregulation.
After the New Year, this is what awaits most apartments in the Czech Republic whose rents do not correspond to the market price.
For this reason, Aktualne.cz has decided to personally visit the "laboratory".
The RPG waiting room on Havirovska street is one of the four in the Ostrava region and is already full on Tuesday at 09:00 a.m.
Right next to the door stands a guard from a security company with a device to call customers.
A special button, "rent 2011", is lit on the touch screen.
One press and a paper with a number comes out of the device.
You don't have time to read your number "157" as your number is already starting to light up on the big screen under the waiting room top.
In a fraction of a second, it's your turn.
After a short time, an old couple arrives to inquire about the rent, but the new rents do not seem to concern the people in the waiting room.
The majority of people have come to solve common problems as everywhere - request for repairs, events concerning insurance and others.
In the Ostrava region, people from more than 44,000 apartments in the RPG portfolio have been receiving mail with new leases in their mailboxes since about mid-November.
RPG Byty offers them rent increases of 15 to 38 percent.
The special window for new rents has been open to the public since 18 November.
"It's been running for almost a week, so it's still on trial," answers, after a moment of hesitation, the employee behind the counter when the client introduces himself as a journalist.
The deregulation and former miners’ apartments of Bakal are a very sensitive local subject.
The deputy speaker of the parliament and native of the Ostrava region Lubomir Zaoralek of the Social Democrats reported on this fairly consistently before the elections and it now fills the local newspapers.
“Twenty years after them, I want a new floor.”
"They didn't even change me a put...n of board in the toilets, relieves himself in introduction the man mentioned.
However, they are mostly, according to employees, retirees who come to be sure that they will receive a discount on the new rent price if they sign now as promised RPG in a special offer.
This is a rebate of half the amount of the rent that will be received by other tenants who have signed their new contract before December 15.
But the "deregulation" window on Havirovaska Street is really not overwhelmed by questions.
"Of the 360 customers who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came for rent," the employee said at the counter.
And yet RPG puts both on its website and in the showcases of individual interviews on rents when necessary.
If the two parties do not agree on the rent, an independent court will make the decision.
"This is not about threats but only about informing about the unique and legitimate way to act legally," RPG said on its website.
"No one is going to go to court here," one of the RPG Byty employees thinks, and the man in the street in front of the customer center agrees with her.
“I have 13,000 kroner to retire and I have 5,000 kroner left to eat, I don’t have enough to go to court,” he says.
The employee suddenly feels uncomfortable.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaoralek in the media is asking that no one sign and so people are waiting," she said.
Rent regulation ends in the Czech Republic with the beginning of 2011 and the increases, according to RPG Byty, are an economic necessity.
"And, moreover, the current rents still do not reach the level necessary for the simple maintenance of the fund for housing," recalls Pavel Klimes, director of the residential portfolio of the company RPG Byty, that it is precisely the negligence of the fund for housing that makes the tenant angry is the main reason for the increase in rent.
However in 5 years between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able with rents to invest in apartments 4 billion, in four years from 2011 to 2014 this should make 5.2 billion.
The large screen hanging from the ceiling in front of the upholstered armchairs in the waiting room on Havirosvka Street, however, repeats some information indicated in red.
“The rent increase in 2011 is 15 percent and concerns no less than 31,200 apartments or more than 90 percent of RPG apartments.”
“And it will always be at most 7.50 Czech crowns per m2 per month,” the screen reads.
The 38 percent increase concerns only 400 apartments in the RPG portfolio.
"In these cases, it is an increase of a very low sum of 19.66 Czech crowns per m2," adds RPG.
Next year the rent will remain the same for 2600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not cause a radical but gradual increase over 4 to 8 years.
It adds other commitments: all the money from the rent increase (see graph) is returned to the apartments in the form of heating savings - new windows and heating.
Those who sign the agreement on the rent increase have priority.
The nursery school is also part of the offices understood by the architects.
the Avriopoint office building in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch. Design.
No one could have expected that it also houses a mini kindergarten with everything you need - colorful walls, imaginative furniture, toys and finally a miniature playground on the terrace.
Since October of last year, children of Arch. design employees can go there.
The architectonic project company Arch. Design., whose workshops have produced a large number of constructions in Brno, has imagined its mini enterprise nursery school since the first drafts of the Avriopoint building.
It employs about 90 people, mostly of child-bearing age, and it was important to it that women architects and project managers could quickly return to work.
Along with reduced time work contracts, kindergarten is a bonus offered to its employees by the company Arch. Design. as part of its social program.
Builders and architects thus have the opportunity to combine caring work with care for children.
It was the employees of Arch.Design. themselves who designed this nursery school and with the support of the management they were able to obtain an endowment from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The mini-kindergarten is financed by the European Social Fund through the Human Resources Operational Programme and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the funding (up to 2.8 million Czech crowns) they were able to buy equipment and appliances and after two years ensure qualified personnel as well as the start-up.
After the use of the funding endowment (two years) the company Arch. Design. has the obligation after 3 years to operate the mini kindergarten on its own funds.
The preparation of the project took a year and it was the company Economy rating that helped to apply for staffing.
Child care is provided by qualified staff, all day a nurse and kindergarten teacher take care of the children. children can go to kindergarten without age limitation but they are more than three yearsoldfor the most part.
As it is a "mini kindergarten" there can only be 5 children present at the same time, but during the day there are more who replace themselves.
The operation of the school is flexible according to the needs of the parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use this school without regard to the hierarchical position.
Although this is individual care and education, the mini kindergarten curriculum is comparable to that for pre-school education.
The children are not just playing there, but quality teaching is also guaranteed - from the beginning to the preparation for school benches English is taught.
The class is equipped not only with imaginative toys and games but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children in society creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can at any time control their child and not have the stress of a delay to pick up the children at a school far from the parents' workplace.
Parents therefore use their working time in the most productive way.
It is not surprising that a natural relationship of loyalty is created between the employee and the employer.
Arch.Design is thus listed among the companies that offer a bonus of choice for the recruitment of new employees and that are friendly to the family and through this program strengthens HR marketing.
The bone house still fascinates after 100 years. Take a look inside Gaudi.
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric saurian, the staircase looks like a dinosaur spine and the balconies look like open fish mouths.
This is how the Casa Battlo house in Barcelona by the architect Antoni Gaudi is.
Due to its organic forms, the house received from the locals the nickname of Bone House.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stones, fragments of tiles and mosaic, facade reminiscent of scales and everywhere present curves, this is all that is epic for Antoni Gaudi's Art Nouveau.
The front facade of the house unfolds its dream lines, its pleasant colors and textures that recall nature and animals.
During a more detailed observation we see the geometry, the rhythm and the order thought with precision.
At night the facade of the house becomes even more dramatic and is lit in such a way that the impression of brightness of the colors is reinforced.
The winding and twisting of the shapes also appears in the interiors with the same measure.
The wood copies in waves the window frames, the balustrades, the decorative elements of the doors, the eyelet and the slats.
The Battlo house, which stands in the Eixample district on the Passeig de Gracia shopping street at number 43, was born from the construction of an 1877 house by the architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The reconstruction took place over two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a wealthy entrepreneur, first insisted on demolishing the old building and building a brand new one but quickly accepted Gaudi's idea of an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
But the idea of Casa Battlo as a multi-unit house was not conceived by Gaudi alone.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It is precisely on his project that the decorations for an apartment of representation of the owner of the building and the use of the mosaic for the facade were born.
Other artists and creators have also worked on the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade.
The joint work for the plans of Casa Battlo began with a successful cooperation between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the construction of Gaudi's Casa Mila and the Park Guell in which there are other works of Gaudi.
The locals nicknamed the house hot just after it was finished because of its organic shapes "the Bone House".
Others, in view of the specific mechanism of opening the windows have called it "the house that yawns".
It is said that at the top of the building there is a sword similar to that of St. George the patron saint of Catalonia.
Other sculptural elements of the building contain hidden religious motifs.
Gaudi thought for the house a unique system in its time of central heating,with ventilation vents and typical fireplaces.
Their inclination of 45 degrees seems strange.
During the creation Gaudi absolutely did not comply with the construction guidelines of the time and did not let himself be hindered by them.
At the beginning of the construction he obtained from the city the permit to build, knowing, of course, that the data on the reconstruction plans were so vague that two years later during the finishing the city council was horrified and asked for modifications.
For example, members of the city council did not like the building pillars impinging on the public sidewalk.
There was never any modification, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the call of the city Josep Battlo asked (and obtained satisfaction) the authorization to rent the two highest floors.
The owner moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a common living room and on the third a bedroom and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The entire six-storey house is shared by a staircase that leads to an independent roof terrace.
All right angles and straight lines were cancelled by the basic elements of the reconstruction and replaced by curved walls.
Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> also worked on the modern concept of linking spaces.
The common part can be completely connected by opening the doors of the living rooms and the high society can communicate comfortably or limit themselves to the private space for more intimate interviews.
The house with the reconstruction of Gaudi received besides new facades a non-traditional roofing and two floors more.
Gaudi’s play with light is also impressive, blue and white glazed tiles with which the inner courtyard is decorated and with the skylights.
The two-color play gives maximum light in all floors of the house.
It was enough simply to bet on the principle that white reflects more than the dark which on the contrary absorbs the rays of the sun.
The Casa Battlo which was inscribed in 2005 in the Unesco World Heritage Fund can be visited by everyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and splendid apartment accessible to the public.
The owners decided to take this step in 2002 on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous designer.
They continued the visits as they found it to be a lucrative venture and they expanded the scope of the visits to the common areas and attic including the roof terraces.
The entrance ticket to the monument is really cheap and costs 16.50 euros; students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist cards have 20 percent discount.
The sum is still above the price of entry to Gaudi's other buildings in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its fantastic turrets, you must quickly find a comrade among the inhabitants of the building and visit the house completely.
How to choose a mattress and a box spring: women have other criteria than men.
No ostentatious frame, but rather the quality of the surface reserved for sleeping, so the mattress and the box spring give a real basis for a good bed.
They must of course complement each other harmoniously to please a concrete user.
During the choice several things are decisive,: weight, height, age, state of health as well as the sex of the owner.
The type of interior in which we are going to place the mattress and the box spring is also important.
A typical example?
For example in the country house where one does not sleep continuously latex mattresses are not appropriate because they "warm up" gently.
In addition, they have a higher weight than standard polyurethane mattresses.
It is necessary to return them frequently.
If they do not also have enough ventilation ducts in the heart and if they also remain on a solid board, they retain moisture. Mold can also form there.
Habit is also decisive in the choice.
Anyone who spends time abroad, where very thick mattresses with a softening layer are frequently used, will hardly feel good on a low, hard surface.
“That’s how all the hockey players who come back from the NHL complain that they can’t sleep there.”
“For their tired shoulders, feet and ribs, they needed mattresses with a softening layer of lazy foam.”
“Such mattresses are also recommended for people who suffer from diabetes who have a disorder of the nervous system that therefore misassume “information” of the joints and skin,” explains Sylva Adamczikova, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
That's why a few years ago the mattress with lazy foam conquered hockey players as well as other customers.
"Today everything is going well, Tempur, the Italian Magnifex but also the Czech Tropico have for example suitable mattresses.
You don’t have to be an NHL guy to enjoy a lazy lather.
This “miracle” simply works.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape according to the absorbed heat or adapts to the heat of your body.
Nothing puts pressure on you and you won’t turn around in the night like after a tough game.
You just sleep better.
Lazy foam also works as a protection against squares.
For the choice of mattress according to your size, add the length of the feet, about 21/34 cm.
A man and a woman of a size of 180cm therefore need a bed of 210/220 cm.
The minimum width for each for a double bed should be 90 cm or a total of 180 cm.
For single beds, for example, it is recommended to take at least 120 / 140 cm.
It is convenient in case of visit.
'However, there is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when lying on your back you should lay your hands comfortably with the elbows slightly bent. Helena Prokopova, President of the Association of Quilting and Decorators who has been dedicated for several years to the problem of healthy sleep and ergonomics of furniture and teaches it in specialized schools.
For a double bed everyone needs their own mattress and mattress, so be careful however during the purchase to choose the height of the mattress.
Otherwise you will only have to mount the box spring at different heights and this is not feasible on all bed frames.
Foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, spring mattresses at least 15 cm, so count for the shape and ventilation layer at least three centimeters.
"To the touch or sitting on the mattress you should not feel the springs," warns Helena Prokopova.
Each mattress requires a specific type of box spring.
The bed-sunk bed, when the mattress and the bed-sunk bed are united like Siamese sisters, has nothing to do in the bedrooms.
The mattresses hurt very badly; it should not be washed, which is commonly done today.
And since during the night we normally sweat from 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat it is clear that after 5/7 years, the mattress begins to resemble a large (and clogged) sieve.
For this reason, specialists refuse to advertise for a life of 25 years for a mattress or a lifetime warranty.
But all to his but.
And for this an experience advice from the sellers: for a mattress of 120/140cm, give up, for the coating of the mattress, hygiene or washing but instead add a protective mattress that you can easily remove and wash.
And even if nowadays it is common to manufacture coatings with zipper for the whole set, that is to say that after opening one has two parts (for washing and the size of the washing machine it is very important!) otherwise the manipulation for large models (and for a single person) becomes when they are removed a fight between a light weight and a heavy weight on a ring.
Do you have a rigid board in your bed instead of a box spring?
No way!
Maximum for a bed intended for visitors for one night only.
However, equip the board (if there are no) with ventilation holes and use the spring mattress with a minimum height of 15cm with bag springs (from Germany Taschenfederken) and a ventilation layer.
A polyurethane mattress should not be part of a bed of this type.
For single-position slatted beds with 14/18 slats, latex mattresses or so-called sandwiches (perhaps the combination of latex and coconut), are the ideal but it will always be better for you to have a mattress with more slats, 28 and above, where the slats are lined up in the lower part of the possible kidneys and thus stiffen.
For mattresses with several positions it is not necessary to take a spring mattress because it does not respond to changes in position.
Next to the adjustment of the rigidity of the slats, it is also possible to install what is called a shoulder cradle.
This is a special connection of the slats that makes it possible to press or even tilt the slat so that the shoulder of the sleeper "fits in" well.
For men who have "shoulders as wide as their backs", this is really an important thing.
This thing is already considered by mattress manufacturers who for "males" have begun to use a softening area at the level of the shoulders.
But they also think about women - they again offer them a softer surface at the hips.
For the most difficult customer there are winged or platelet bed bases with what is called a multi-force suspension.
The pressure spreads to more points and diinuates the tension.
But of course, be careful, as soon as you use a bad pillow (large and inflated with air) on good mattresses and box spring, the "plus" disappears.
The basic rule is a simple pillow: the pillow must support the head and its tips must reach only the shoulders, so that the shoulder muscles can rest.
The recommended size is 50X60 cm which Scandinavians prefer per exmple.
When lying on the side, the pillow should level the height of the shoulders (with the shoulder cradle of the box spring or the softened area in the mattress).
Modern mattresses still have something in common with the first ones based on straw and herbs.
Manufacturers still use natural materials or mixtures.
The trend is also towards organic mattresses.
Petroleum-based raw materials, from which polyurethane is made, are replaced by natural oils, such as soybean oil.
Almost all known manufacturers use soy.
“The term ‘organic’ for mattresses means that the heart is made from natural products,” says Petr Vasicek of Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used for mattress coverings; one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can add micro-capsules that develop fragrances of the forest or lavender.
There are differences between men and women.
While the extract of birch plants so that the mattress coating absorbs heat and cools the body, "cools" the man, the coatings "warm" women.
The red pepper extract accelerates blood circulation and is therefore warmer for the weaker sex.
The current favorites?
Mattresses made from cold foam (it has more pores with a disturbed cellular structure so more breathable than standard polyurethane and has more elasticity.
The combination of different stiffnesses of cold foams gives polyzone mattresses that know precisely where the head, lower back and feet are.
You will pay a quality mattress from 7000 crowns and more.
Those that are characterized by their health parameters have less VAT and are taken as instruments for health.
In the Czech Republic, Gumotex took first place.
Saving for the mattress and the box spring is not easy.
From time to time we can have as part of special actions on the part of manufacturers or producers two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, Magniflex offers Duofreeze mattresses with Memory memory foam sewn to the coating for 11990 crowns.
Of course, you can take the second one for free.
The era of lazy or viscoelastic foams with an open cellular structure and great thickness was started with the Tempur material at a "cosmic" pace.
It started as a material for NASA because astronauts were suffering from the start-up of huge load factors.
The Tempur softens in the heat and hardens, on the contrary, in the cold.
It therefore adapts perfectly to the warm human body and distributes optimal pressure to it.
It is therefore ideal against bad sleep and for an increase in comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses but also for health products, such as special foot cushions that relieve the legs and venous system.
For example, Czech manufacturers use EucathermC or Twinsaver foam or the same type.
Devices to track people are increasingly in demand by parents who want to monitor their children.
The fear for their child leads more and more people to think about monitoring them through a GPS.
The system, set up at the beginning to search for cars, can also be used to track the movement of people and help in some cases, such as that of little Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is currently as big as a matchbox but will soon be the size of a watch.
The case of little Anicka moved a large number of people and they began to look for ways to better protect their children.
Even if the price is to disturb their privacy.
“We are trying to tell everyone that this is not espionage but just another way to decrease the likelihood of another tragedy,” says Petr Pilin of MAcro Weil, one of the providers of tracking devices in the Czech market.
"I admit that there may be cases of misuse of such devices, such as putting it in the bag of a person who is not aware, but I have not yet encountered such cases."
“The majority of people are customers who actually buy the product for safety reasons,” Pilin adds.
According to him, children should always know for what purposes "the box" is used and how to use it in an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bockova points out that if the child does not want to wear something like this on him, he will get rid of it.
“And even the smallest ones can show great creativity when it comes to purposely getting rid of something when they don’t want to be under control.”
“Mobile phones, which can cut themselves like these tracing devices, have already led parents to long waits,” Bockova says.
According to her, the fact that this type of device can help in case of aggression is very questionable.
"If it is a prepared abduction, the perpetrator will do everything to ensure that the child does not have an electronic device that can locate him."
“Right now, it’s the phone.”
"As soon as the tracking devices are developed, they (criminals) will also look for them because the sale will be supported by an advertising campaign."
“In such cases the criminals will always be ahead of the police,” says the psychologist.
She admits, however, that such devices can help during an unprepared assault by a pedophile.
According to Robert Cech of RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both cars and people, having this type of device can help, even if it is destroyed in the event of an assault.
"The device can be set to be in regular transmission after a specified period of time."
"In the event that the device is destroyed, it remains the last position of the person concerned."
“The more expensive devices also have an inclinometer that immediately signals the position of the person who has slid and is lying down without moving,” says Cech.
According to him, so-called smart mobile phones that are equipped with a navigation system can offer a comparable service after having formatted it with a special software.
The problem with current tracking systems is that it is either a device similar to those worn as a pendant the size of a matchbox or smaller telephone devices.
We can always lose them.
According to Pilina of the company Macro Weil, this is why tests are currently being conducted to make devices that look like common digital watches.
"This will have the advantage that the potential aggressor will not be able to recognize the tracking device."
“Or he’ll realize it after a while, which will have given the police a little bit more time,” he adds.
Whether the tracing device is developed in the form of a bracelet or pendant, it will always use the same technology as when tracing cars.
It is a combination of position acquisition systems using GPS (which is commonly used in auto-navigation) and a mobile phone function that alerts a vehicle's current position.
The army has so many detonating cords that it could go around the Czech Republic with them, but it can only last two years.
The army bought for 445 km of cords used for explosives.
Already last year the Ministry of Defense had bought 224 km.
The army has reserves for 225 years.
The problem is that the life of the cords is two to four years maximum.
The army bought detonating cords from the public limited company STV Group for 40 million crowns.
The General Staff gave as a reason for the purchase of a huge amount of detonating cords to MF DNES that soldiers use 60 km per year.
According to the reserve calculations to be held by the army pyrotechnicians, which MF DNES contacted, it appears that even generals, officers with a command, secretaries or household personnel should have an explosives exercise every year.
Alexander Vondra, Minister of Defence and Vlastimil Picek, Commander of the Army are no exception.
Only to argue the army's annual consumption of 60 km of detonating cords.
This distance corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even if that were true, the army reserves could support it for 10 years.
If on the contrary it would be true that for the basic training of each of the new professionals it is enough at most 2 m of detonating cords, as the experts say, this means that the army with its new purchase has ensured - with also the consumption of special units and engineering - reserves for the 225 years mentioned.
Yet the soldiers of the Rapid Response Brigade recently complained to Minister Vondra that they have almost no ammunition for their handguns and that shooting sessions are limited because of the need for money.
There's no mention of the lack of body wash.
"And I don't mind if they buy such a large quantity of detonating cords from us."
“And that’s their decision and they really know what they’re doing.”
“For us the army is a good customer that we strive to please as traders,” says STV Group’s Chief Commercial Officer Jan Decky.
Jan Pejsek, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defense, argues that hundreds of kilometers of detonating cords have been acquired because the army will have these "ammunitions" in reserve for 10 years.
Jan Decky of STV Group reports, however, that the lifespan of the detonating cords and pyrotechnics of the police and army is only four years.
“If they are perfectly stored in the depots, it can even go up to four years,” says one of the two, who does not want his name to be published in view of the criticism of the army.
The life span passed, each munition must be tested to see if it remains intact and does not threaten the life of the soldier.
However, these tests are not free and still cost money.
The other argument of the ministry is a discount due to the quantity for 445 km of detonating cords.
"They cost us 60 percent less than last year's supply of 245 km," said spokesman Pejsek, who interprets the advice of buyers of the defense ministry.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of the detonating cords of the police pyrotechnicians that neutralize the munitions of the Second World War or those after the Soviet army, does not exceed 1500 meters.
And the police always order only the necessary amount of ammunition to be used before the end of their life.
This has been established for the safety of pyrotechnicians and in order to be able to obtain more flexibly more modern and reliable types of detonating cords.
The Ministry of Defence is now facing major problems in neutralizing tens of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Pact era, when the 200,000-strong Czechoslovak army was preparing to move towards the Rhine.
What awaits in a few years this Czech army that MF DNES contacted: neutralize hundreds of kilometers of old detonating cords that it buys today "cheaply".
To this day I take advantage of contacts that I have obtained through the contests.
The franchise sale of his hotel helped Lukas Pytloun for the place of winner of the competition of the best Individual Entrepreneur.
The winner of last year’s Best Individual Entrepreneur competition was 28-year-old entrepreneur Lukas Pytloun.
His journey to success is like a movie.
Lukas Pytloun loved to travel.
And abroad, he realized that in Liberec there was a lack of a quality hosting site at a reasonable price.
From his savings on what he had earned when working abroad and with the help of a bank loan he bought a small building of 5 apartments half demolished.
Knowing that he was still a student in his third year of graduate school, it was a brave move.
"The relationship between the quality and the price of accommodation in our region made me want to do something," says Lucas Pytloun.
He began to rent the first reconstructed apartment to foreign workers.
He reinvested the profit in the building that he transformed into a boarding house with 54 beds.
Since then, his entrepreneurial action has allowed him to open in Liberec 4 pensions, two restaurants of style and two hotels with a total capacity of nearly 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year, another one of the same quality arrived.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrova U Tise where we sold our franchise concept and other candidates for the Pytloun hotel franchise have come forward," the number 1 entrepreneurs of last year.
"And for the sale of the license for the commissioning of a large-scale hotel the victory in the Entrepreneur of the Year competition served well," Pytloun adds gratefully.
The victory brought him more popularity and to be known in Liberec and its surroundings.
“People recognized me in the streets, often congratulated me and, I must say, it was very pleasant,” he recalls.
It recommends participation in this competition to all those who are trying to do something.
It is not necessary to win but any opportunity to be visible is good.
He says that he uses to this day his contacts and knowledge that he could not have obtained in any other way.
"With those I met through the contest I started to have business relationships regularly.
According to him, the fame related to the success also had an impact on the employees.
And he's about 70.
"I especially see their loyalty and pride in being committed to something that has generally been recognized."
“This is by far not the only result of my personal work, but the result of good work from all of us together.
“Only my name is pushed forward,” says Lucas Pytloun modestly.
I wish my successor a better year than the one we had at Farmet.
The euphoria of victory was quickly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the winner's sense of purpose Farmet has the worst moments behind him.
The one who came to Slovansky dum for the first place of the contest for the Firm of the Year organized by Vodaphone last year is Karel Zdarsky the owner of the company Farmet.
The jury rewarded the efforts with which it transformed a tooling workshop in Ceska Skalice into a firm with a turnover of 100 million crowns.
"I can say that the award not only encouraged my colleagues but also increased our self-confidence in the fight against competition," says the winner of last year's competition.
At the beginning of the history of the company Farmet there was a desire to do something useful.
And so when the state proposed to Karel Zdrasky's father to rent the small workshop as compensation after the confiscation of property by the communists, he did not hesitate for a long time, refused a career in a firm where he worked at the time, and created a company with a few comrades in his father's entourage for the manufacture of plastic bathtubs.
Not long after they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
After eighteen years, it became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
The company was known even in the non-specialized public after the success of the competition through the media.
“Not only did our customers start to really get to know the Farmet brand better but also the foreign partners who started to realize that they were collaborating with a company that achieved the greatest success in its home country,” says Karel Zdarsky.
But the past year has not been spent at Farmet alone in the euphoria of victory.
The assessment of the company was based on the economic results of 2008 and part of 2009.
2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering machinery.
At the height of the crisis, which did not really affect citizens, companies were forced to stop their investment projects and begin to limit their purchases of new materials and technologies.
“Of course, we did not escape this situation.”
“The turnover fell by 40 percent, and we had to limit our production and even lay off,” explains Karel Zdarsky.
A viable society must know that from time to time unpopular measures must be taken.
But they managed the situation properly and retained beneficial results even if they were inferior to those they had before the crisis.
At Farmet, however, they continued uncompromisingly to invest in research and development.
"We built a training and research centre with the endowments, strengthened the company's presentation in international trade fairs and won the main awards in national exhibitions," says Zdarsky.
Everything suggests that the crisis is behind them.
The figures of affirmations go up and with them the number of employees also.
"To the new winner I wish this pleasant feeling of victory but in a calm atmosphere," said Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation that removes senseless regulations.
The Absurdity of the Year investigation is for the fourth time a part of the business clan.
Some absurd regulations have been removed.
The unsatisfactory winner of this year's Absurdity of the Year survey was the requirement to bring into the offices documents that public servants can obtain online.
More than a third of the 4,000 voters voted for it.
For example, the social affairs administration requested a paper extract from the commercial register, whereas the grievor can obtain it in two mouse clicks.
It changes because of the investigation.
"The Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer ask for the trade register extract for insurance payment checks," said Jana Buranova, a spokeswoman for the Czech Social Insurance Administration (CSSZ).
Bringing out all the regulations and decrees that companies and entrepreneurs must fulfill in the Czech Republic and getting rid of those that are absurd is the meaning of this year’s Absurdity contest.
This survey is again this year for the fourth time a part of the business clan organized by Hospodarske noviny and has even greater popularity.
If last year 3,000 voters came forward, this year at least 4,000 have cast their votes.
And it is not surprising, there are in our country the most diverse legal obligations that only slow down the company, and,this, more and more.
"We may have a lot of paperwork to fill out for the top tax returns in the world," says Karel Havlicek of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of entrepreneurial activity has become a proclaimed goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared to the rest of the world, the situation in the Czech Republic is not improving at all.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic is in 74th place in terms of conditions for the company, 8 places more than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year competition was first established in 2006 and continues each year according to the same scenario.
Anyone can report every year on the administrative and bureaucratic absurdities from April to the end of September, the last time before the contest closes.
To account there is the website www.firmaroku.cz. Then, the organizer of the contest chooses seven candidates for the "anti-prize" and lets the public vote during the month of October on the site www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and on www.ihned.cz.
The Absurdity that received the highest number of votes is declared the winner.
Until the last investigation last year, it was a hundred, or more exactly 105 regulations and decrees that lost their meaning of existence.
The remarks are sent by the entrepreneurs but also the professional unions and the professors.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, therefore among the nominees is for example the obligation that the maintenance vehicles of highways and expressways pay tolls, or that contractors with twenty employees, repaint two offices and two toilets every two years.
The list of the seven proposals is published on the competition website.
The proclamation of the contest, which always begins at the beginning of November on Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of a happening in which personalities from political and public life regularly participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, Director of the Association for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises of the Czech Republic or Petr Kuzel, President of the Czech Chamber of Commerce, attended the highlight of the competition.
"Economic prosperity cannot work when the state puts jacks in the legs of entrepreneurs and for this my goal is to remove, every year, at least three dozen paragraphs that today only complicate the business," said Martin Kocourek, the Minister of Industry and Trade.
The effort to suppress absurd decrees is not a sword in the water.
In 2007, what did not please people was the obligation of entrepreneurs to declare three days before at the office for the sole proprietorship at the place where the company is located, the intention to go to an exhibition or pilgrimage with a stand.
This obligation was removed with the amendment of the Individual Enterprise Act.
The second most popular requirement in 2007, which was to declare a 30-day service trip for a foreign employee to the Labour Office, was removed with the enactment of the so-called Green Card Act.
And everything is ok until the third session of the contest.
The Absurdity of 2009 was the ruling for physiotherapists to have a large mirror in their office, a refrigerator and two automatic scales.
This was changed by order of the Ministry of Health last year—the requirement to have a refrigerator was removed.
A new category rewards socially responsible firms.
Ecological, humanitarian, training or sports projects are evaluated.
The novelty of this year's Hospodarske Noviny competition, which has already existed for 5 years, is the category called the Responsible Firm of the Year 2010.
The aim of this competition is reasonable and fair business support.
"We want to support companies that monitor their company's impacts on the environment and conduct a socially responsible activity," says Patrick Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile operator, the firm Vodaphone, which is the guarantor and promoter of this contest, as in the case of the contest for the rebel of the year.
For this first year of this subcategory of the competition of the firm of the year 2010, organized by the firm Vodaphone, have registered the companies that have no success with a single long-term goal for the company.
The adventure of each of them is rich of inspirations and an independent article would be to edit.
Although the purpose of their business is different from each other, their support and foresight activity can be considered as the denominator of their efforts.
For one of the cases, this concerns people with disabilities and the personal or health problems of their employees.
Among the fourteen finalists for the entire Czech Republic is the Prague software company Et Netera which supports the creation of informal sports teams of their employees who then participate in a number of tournaments in different sports disciplines.
Another example of a firm responsible for the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo which has been the main contributor to the endowment fund that sponsors children with disabilities for 17 years.
The old paper factory in Podebrad, which employs more than 70 per cent of its employees, has been awarded the title of Responsible for the Central Bohemian Region and placed third in the region in the competition of the firm of the year organized by Vodaphone.
In Olomouc, it was MiRyz Soft, a financial company, which won for introducing flexible working hours and even decreased up to 35 hours per week on average and, this, without, proportionally, decrease in salary.
The jury also awarded her the title because she prioritizes buying from Czech manufacturers, supports a DIY activity in the nearby environment and cares about the environment.
“We strive to recycle as much as possible so that our business activity and administration have the least impact on the environment,” says Miluse Ryznarova, the company’s executive director.
the company responsible for IT Enlogit of the Usti Region also thinks about the health of its employees and has set up for each laptop an ergonomic chair and keyboard, encourages their work at home and uses the catering services of a local protected factory for its actions.
"We also support the Man in the Shadow Foundation, which helps the local Roma community," says Ondrej Suchy, the company's representative.
In the last rank, also for its activities, is a company of Washing and cleaning of the Karlovy Vary region, which participates in the retirement insurance of its employees in the form of bonuses above standards.
"In our society we contribute to food, transport, increasing skills and leisure," says Joseph Strapac of the bruntal construction company Czasch, winner for the Moravian-Silesian region.
All regional finalists for the Vodaphone Firm of the Year competition were automatically entered in the Responsible Company category, who had completed the attached questionnaire for registration and returned it to the organizer by August 15.
Incomplete or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were removed from the contest by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the firms in competition had not answered the questions, they could not participate in the competition of the Responsible firm but were not disqualified from the "main" competition the Firm of the year of Vodaphone".
"Independent entries are not possible because this is a sub-category of the main competition of the Firm of the Year," explains Karel Goldman of the organizing agency Bison & Rose.
At the Land Fund in Plzen, police made arrests during a public competition
In the Land Fund building in Plzen, anti-corruption police have made arrests in recent days.
The detectives handed over the handcuffs to the local entrepreneur and real estate trader Lubos.
The latter had tried to manipulate a public tender for the settlement of a request for restitution in such a way that the land proposed was obtained by a specific candidate.
The latter was to pay Lubos G. half a million crowns.
"At the moment I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting a person for insider trading in the context of a public tender and competition," Plzen Prosecutor's Office chief Antonie Zelena told the Pravo newspaper, knowing that it is forbidden to provide more explanations because the investigation is ongoing.
The police released the 46-year-old entrepreneur after 24 hours.
To know how it could influence a public competition, one can only speculate in view of the very little official information.
A question from Pravo, the spokesperson of the Land Fund Lubomira Cerna said that the police officers had actually made an arrest in Plzen at a separate workplace and this during the public competition.
"It was a customer and not an employee," she said.
The public competition according to Cerna has as its real name "Call to propose rights for the transfer of land according to the Land Law" and is set up when several beneficiaries of the right manifest themselves.
“These people are proposing, as part of the appeal, a higher value of their rights to restitution that must be settled before the value of the land is announced.”
"According to the proposed rights, a ranking of the buyers is set up and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who proposed the highest rights," the Fund spokesman explained.
Lubos G. had, of course, the information concerning the persons who had registered for the appeal and since he himself was also a beneficiary because he had bought a large number of rights to restitution, he had offered to the candidates on the ground not to participate in the competition.
And he was probably cashing in by withdrawing.
Which would explain why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his arrest.
Lubos G. had contacts well above the standards at the FdT (Land Fund).
It was included in the case of former FdT chief Vaclav Sankot, who was prosecuted for editing land for which the decision to set up a building had already been published.
For example, Lubos G. had obtained land for the construction of public communications, specifically in the place where the access road to the industrial area of Borske Pole was to be built.
Later he exchanged it with the town hall for a building in the historic center of the city whose value is far superior.
The town hall was forced to accept because otherwise it risked endangering the construction by blocking the land.
Households will pay an additional one hundred crowns monthly for housing.
From January, households will have to pay a supplement not only for all types of energy but also for water and sanitation, heating supplies and in some places rents will also increase.
From January onwards, families will have to draw up to a hundred crowns a month more than they do now.
Electricity increases by 4.6 percent, gas by almost 2 percent more expensive, in some localities you will have to pay up to a tenth more for the supply of water, and in many places central heating supplies will also be more expensive.
The increase in electricity is expected to be around 100 kroner per annum more for apartment households than at present.
However, all suppliers have decreased electricity prices given the sensitive development to encourage the manufacture of renewable energy, including photovoltaic cells.
The gas increases moderately but of course at the time when people need it most to heat and therefore have the greatest consumption.
We can therefore also count a hundred crowns more.
Although electricity and gas are increasing throughout the Czech Republic, the change in the price of central heating differs from city to city.
It is mainly the larger municipalities that plan the price increase.
For example households in Pardubice or Hradec Kraloce will pay from January for central heating almost 50 kroner more per month, families in Liberec will pay more than 1000 kroner annually.
For the inhabitants of Prague is preparing an increase of 9 percent for water and sanitation in case the city increases infrastructure rents.
If the rents do not change the pragmatists will pay an additional 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague will still be among the lowest in comparison with the whole country.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sanitation are increasing by 7.4 percent.
Rent prices will rise significantly, for example, in the 450 thousand apartments rented from January, that is to say at the end of the regulation.
For example, the company CPI Byty, which owns almost 2,500 apartments in Usti nad Labem, has decided to increase it up to 100 percent.
Those who do not agree with the new increase in rents will be brought to court by the company.
Regulated rents paid by people in nearly 300,000 apartments could rise by 10 percent next year.
Czech children get drunk with rum and fernet. Beer is no longer fashionable and acts very gently.
Fernet, rum, vodka and exceptionally also the best brand of whisky are stolen from parents.
These are drinks that most often bring those who get drunk, who are not yet fifteen years old, into the hands of the doctor.
Children who are treated in the hospital for recidivism are no exception.
This results from the experience of doctors who encounter cases similar to the admissions of children's departments of hospitals.
"Beers or wines are no longer fashionable because it takes time to be drunk."
"The trend is really towards strong alcohols," Ludek Pelikan, head of the children's department at Horovice Hospital in central Bohemia, told Pravo.
"When they manage to chip a bottle of papa in the closet, it is sometimes whiskey but it is the fernet and vodka that prevail.
“Vodka has this advantage that they can mix it with fruit juice and so not smell it,” explains the head of the department.
Eva Jurinova, spokesperson for the Motol hospital, also agrees.
"It's usually rum or fernet."
"It is now alcohol in fashion, especially in elementary schools."
"In some cases it was slivovice that they brought back from the house," Jurinova added.
According to the Head of Department Pélikan, seeing drunk children between the ages of thirteen and fourteen at hospital admissions is a normal phenomenon.
Before working in Horovice since last year, he was in Motol where he practiced pediatrics for ten years, where ambulances brought schoolchildren from the surrounding area completely drunk.
"A young girl was hospitalized like this four times
"She began her career at the age of twelve when she was brought with 3.5 per thousand alcohol in the blood with in addition a mixture with ecstasy," described the doctor this particularly important case.
"She was at the Holesovice Exhibition Centre at a party."
"What's interesting is that it didn't seem strange to the mother that her daughter was absent for 48 hours," the head of the department said.
It is precisely the parents' unselfishness or their extraordinary tolerance of the fact that their offspring indulge in drinking that is the main cause of the development of children's alcoholism.
According to specialists, however, we do not talk about dependence, in its strict sense, for children.
"Under the term alcoholic we mean a chronic dependence on alcohol for several years with all the phenomena that result from it but that is not found in children."
"In those who use alcohol repeatedly, it is rather a significantly unfavorable socio-familial background," explained the Head of Department Pélikan.
According to spokeswoman Jurinova, about forty drunken children were hospitalized this year until mid-November in the pediatric clinic in Motol.
Only cases with severe intoxication requiring hospitalization are included in the statistics.
Drunk children who are after emergency care taken home by parents or the police are not counted.
In addition to the cases of children sitting down and drinking a bottle of alcohol after school, according to Pélikan there are three seasonal waves that can be counted on: the day of the witches, St. Sylvester and the end of the school year.
"Either they drink out of spite after bad results or on the contrary they celebrate the beginning of the holidays."
"Of course I experienced the witches' day an admission of 7 drunk children at once," said Pélikan.
The drunken child who spent the night in the hospital undergoing rehab under medical supervision is paradoxically in a better position than the one who returned home and suffers the next day from the "hangover".
The morning headaches caused by dehydration and lack of glucose are eliminated by an infusion of glucose and nutrients that the body needs.
"They are better off for this because they have a great night and then a sweet awakening and nothing hurts them."
“They’re just amazed at where they are,” Pelikan adds, knowing that from time to time this spoils the patients’ good mood at least with the bill to pay for their care.
Ambulance transport and intensive care bed hospitalization can go up to tens of thousands of kroner.
“From time to time, I applied this as a means of education by telling these children how much their drunkenness cost and that they could spend the whole summer in seasonal work to repay a single evening,” Pelikan added.
However, according to him, the health insurance companies in their regression management, which should recover from the parents the burdens related to care, do not treat the cases of drunken children.
Two L-159 aircraft are for the first time in foreign hands in Spain.
Two L-159 aircraft of the five in all, against which the Ministry of Defense exchanged transport aircraft Casa C-295M, took off on Tuesday for Seville in Spain where the aircraft manufacturer Casa-EADS is based.
This is the first time that aircraft of this type have become the property of anyone other than the Czech army.
However, they have been abroad as part of exercises or demonstration flights.
These are two-seater versions of the L-159T1 that were until now in service in the Czech army and were in flight condition.
The three remaining aircraft are single-seat versions of the L-159.
These are currently stationed at Aéro Vodochody and the commercial intermediary - the firm Omnipol - took them into account last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the press department of the Ministry of Defense, the physical departure of Vodochody's planes is currently unknown.
“The single-seat L-159 aircraft planned for the exchange were taken from long-storage aircraft without causing additional charges or investment for the Ministry of Defence.”
"The two-seater L-159 T1 was exchanged in the state," he told Pravo Pejsek.
He added that the army will not be left without two-seaters since the ministry signed in May 2009 with Aéro Vodochody an agreement worth 200 million crowns for the transformation of four unused L-159 single-seaters into two two-seaters.
The army took delivery of the first aircraft in July, with the second scheduled for delivery later this year.
According to Pejsek EADS has committed to introduce the aircraft in the equipment of some countries of the Alliance.
"The contract clearly states that the one that takes into account the L-159 aircraft is EADS and that they will be used for the training of pilots from NATO member countries."
"It is therefore the business of the one who is considering how to achieve this," Pejsek said.
Hospodarske noviny announced some time ago that the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159s for a Casa aircraft and the purchase of three more aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns was approved last year by the government of Mirek Topomanek.
The Ministry of Defence did not issue a call for tenders and contacted EADS directly.
the direction of the defense argued then that the exchange assures a future export of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought 72 aircraft from Aéro Vodochody and used only 24, wanting to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa aircraft is likely to have legal implications.
However, the European Commission has filed a complaint against the Czech Ministry of Defence with the European Court of Justice because the aircraft should have been selected in a European-wide tender and in no case by contacting a manufacturer directly.
The army has already taken delivery of three Casa aircraft, the last one is expected to arrive at Prague Kbely airport in two weeks.
An index finger longer than the ring finger is a sign of low cancer risk
Men who have an index finger longer than the ring finger have a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday by the British magazine Cancer.
This may depend on the level of the male hormone testosterone.
“Our findings show that relative finger length serves as a simple test of prostate cancer risk, especially for men before age 60,” said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help determine which men should get tested for prostate cancer, including by combining it with genetic risk or other aggravating factors such as a family health history, Eeles added.
During the period 1994-2009 she followed with her colleagues in Britain more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time nearly three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the study participants had the index finger of the right hand shorter than the ring finger.
For them as for the 19 percent of those who had fingers of the same length, the same probability of prostate cancer was found.
In the case of those who had the index longer than the ring finger, however, the risk fell to 33 percent, for men before age 60, the decrease in risk reached 87 percent.
The length ratio of the two fingers mentioned - formed during the prenatal period - indicates in particular different levels of sex hormones to which the child is exposed in the womb.
A lower testosterone corresponds to a longer index.
Previous research has shown that it is testosterone that helps the development of prostate cancer.
Professor Vacla Paces, a renowned Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, told CTK that he is aware of the study but does not believe that the relationship between finger length and cancer is "fully demonstrated".
The Czech Republic is under snow, the D1 and D5 motorways are closed.
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is covered with snow this Thursday morning.
On the roads and sidewalks, there is mostly compact snow, the bailiffs worked all night in many places.
The D5 motorway is closed in the morning between the 89th and 93rd kilometre in the direction of Rozvadov due to several truck and car accidents and the D1 motorway in Brno in the direction of Prague suffers the same fate.
The dispatcher of the Central Automobile Club (UAMK) told the news
In the 91st kilometer a truck was injured, in the 93rd two heavy trucks collided, the accident caused injuries.
Several cars also ended up in the ditch.
The problems are also on the D1 motorway at 185 <0xC3><0xA8>me kilometre in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks were hit by it.
Drivers should exit just after Brno at the 190th kilometer or go through Brno and then enter at the 182nd kilometer in Kyvalka.
A line of cars of several kilometers was formed at this place.
Also on the D11 motorway, there is an accident and, this, just on arrival in Prague.
In Prague, there is a layer of snow several centimeters thick, thermometers indicate - 7 degrees Celsius.
Lines of cars are created for example in Prosek, Sterboholska street is also blocked.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
Trams are lagging behind, for example on the line between Charles Square (Karlove Namesti) and Peace Square (Namesti Miru).
At eight o'clock in the morning the crisis staff of Prague has yet to meet.
The railways and the airport are also experiencing problems.
The Czech Railways have already had to remove because of the snow 7 links of rapids.
The lines for example from Prague to Kralupy or from Prague to Beroun have problems
Travellers should monitor the current situation.
The Ruzyne airport has been closed since Wednesday 11:00 at night until 5 am.
Most of the roads in South Moravia are already rollable but with increased vigilance.
On the road to Vyskov, three side roads are impassable, on the road to Brno there are beginning to be gusts of snow in places and on the road to Blansko the chains are mandatory to pass certain communication routes in the places placed above.
The Vyskov region was among the most affected places.
So far the axes are closed: Rusinov-Slavkov, Bohdalice-Kucerov and also Saratice-Milesovice
To clean them you may need to send snow plows and snow cutters.
It is not yet possible to estimate when they will be rolled.
On the road to Hodonin caution is de rigueur in the White Carpathians region.
On roads that are, with regard to the protection of nature, maintained only by the spraying of inert products, there is still a layer of 5 centimeters of snow warns CTK.
In the Czech Republic, it fell between two to 10 centimeters of snow; it fell the most in northern Bohemia, with, often, up to 18 centimeters of snow.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, up to 15 centimeters of snow fell.
Snow cover is gradually disappearing in the Czech Republic.
Americans have a new “smart weapon”
The U.S. military has sent a new “smart” weapon, known only as the XM-25, to Afghanistan.
The generals believe that this new automatic rifle will have an influence on the conflict there with the Taliban and “will change the game” for their benefit.
The new weapon is like a super accurate cannon
Its projectiles are guided by laser with an accuracy of a few meters.
The special 25 mm ammunition developed for this rifle and containing a highly explosive, works in fact like small grenades.
The munitions can be programmed in such a way that they will explode in contact with the target but also at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
It can therefore be used against an enemy who hides behind an obstacle, a wall or a ditch.
He is also not protected from above and when a deadly rain of steel splinters falls on him, it can put him out of action as well.
According to Richard Audette who took part in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon that uses “smart” technology.
The soldier essentially uses it in such a way that he finds the target, sends him a laser beam that determines the distance, thus obtaining a precise point of sight, according to which he corrects his site sight and presses on the trigger.
"Let's say you aimed at 543 meters."
“When you press the trigger, the weapon charges and fires at the distance of 543 meters plus or minus 1, 2, 3 meters,” Audette said.
400 jobs relocated
Fujitsu Group moves its subsidiary from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
Next year in July, 400 employees will transfer their workplace to Astro Park, which is currently located in the office building on Mareinbader Square in the Bad Homburg region.
The Japanese group Fujitsu relocates its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As stated on Wednesday by the giant specialized in the manufacture and maintenance of computers, next year in July, the workplace of 400 men and women, located so far in the Marienbader square of the city of Bad Homburg, will be transferred to Astro Park, a huge office complex located on Lyoner Street in the Niederrad district of Frankfurt.
A spokeswoman for Fujitsu said that in the medium term, the group should bring together 100 other jobs still scattered so far in the region.
The rental offer was extremely attractive, and the open-plan offices at Astro Park are more suited to the way employees work.
In Bad Homburg too, Fujitsu was just tenant.
Managing director Bernd Wagner said: "Frankfurt-Niederrad is a prime location for us with outstanding infrastructure."
He says the connection to the airport is just as important to a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of a major company within the region yesterday aroused the joy of the winners and caused the disappointment of the losers.
The head of economic affairs for the municipality of Frankfurt, Mr. Markus Frank (CDU), said that once again, a "global player" had been conquered.
It is an "extraordinary profession of faith relative to the place of implantation".
Fujitsu is well suited to the city and its location is an important boost for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Mr. Michael Korwisi (the Greens), regrets Fujitsu’s decision.
Management informed the municipality of this intention at an early stage.
"It goes without saying that we have offered our help to this company," Korwisi said.
However, friendly relations could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer against the owner of the building in Place Marienbader.
In the end, the economic reasons would have been decisive.
It is now a matter of preventing such an exceptional place from remaining unoccupied for a long time.
"I hope that the owner and landlord of the building will be cooperative."
Ten years ago, the Town Hall Square building, used until now by the Fujitsu company and the nearby "small vertical", as well as the rest of the buildings of Marienbad Square, were part of the controversial construction project of the spa.
The result of a joint project of the municipality and a private project developer, a new entrance to the city was created between the station and the Town Hall, which attracted much criticism, not only because of the impressive layout of the surfaces that used to be partly parking, but also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment rating and advisory firm Feri, the computer manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as Fujitsu, the computer manufacturer still associated with Siemens at the time, moved into the buildings.
In 2006, the German Frankfurt-based specialist Immobilien-Chancen acquired the buildings occupied by Fujitsu at the same time as the Morgan Stanley real estate fund. A year later, these buildings were sold to the Spanish company Falcon Real Estate Investments SA based in Madrid.
The Tokyo-based Fujitsu Group considers itself to be the world’s third largest provider of IT products.
For example, it makes computers and servers available to businesses and also provides the essential service.
Its branch in the Rhine-Main region is one of the largest in Germany: Fujitsu certainly has many more employees in Munich.
The branch, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, leaves Bad Homburg to settle in Frankfurt-Niederrad. The other subsidiaries present in this site are Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
For this, 7000 square meters have rented in the Astro Park building.
This twenty-year-old complex, whose name recalls its star-shaped plan, houses, among other things, the headquarters of the Confederation of the Electronics and Electrotechnical Industry.
Expulsion of the server by Amazon - Threats against Mr. Assange
Wikileaks is getting more and more difficult.
The Internet service provider Amazon has expelled from its servers the site specializing in the disclosure of confidential documents.
Perhaps this attitude hides the political pressure that has been put on them after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
The founder of WikiLeaks, Mr. Assange, is apparently staying in England.
In the United States, the Wikileaks website is under attack with ever greater force.
The group of cyber-activists "Wikileaks" no longer has access to its server hosted so far in America and is now looking for a host in Europe.
Meanwhile, prominent U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman has called on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is wanted by Interpol, is likely staying in Britain, according to newspaper reports.
"Wikileaks excluded from Amazon server."
"Freedom of expression in the country of freedom," said Wednesday (local time) the cyber-activists behind the revelations via the social network Twitter.
Shortly before, the cyber company, Amazon, had removed the Wikileaks documents from its servers.
After the release of the secret diplomatic memos, the cyber-activists used Amazon Web Service (AWS) in order to achieve the greatest number of access to documents.
On Twitter, Wikileaks continues its revelations: “Great, our dollars are now being spent on caring for people in Europe.”
When free speech is a problem for Amazon, “they should stop selling books.”
CNN, citing Liebermann’s office, reported that Amazon banned Wikileaks from using its servers after an investigation by Sen. Joe Lieberman’s staff.
The chairman of the Senate committee for the protection of the territory had threatened the Amazon site to orchestrate a boycott against it, reported the British newspaper, "The Guardian".
“I would have liked Amazon to take this action sooner given WikiLeaks’ previous releases of classified information,” he said.
At the same time, Mr. Liebermann called on other countries to refuse the use of servers by the platform.
"WikiLeaks is acting in an illegal, monstrous and unscrupulous manner, and in so doing, is endangering our national security and endangering lives around the world," the independent senator said in a statement.
"No company aware of its responsibilities, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks disseminate the contents of the stolen documents."
WikiLeaks founder Assange, who is wanted by Swedish authorities on suspicion of rape, is on Interpol’s wanted list.
According to the London newspaper The Independent, the 39-year-old Australian lives in Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where he is.
The cyber-activist has consistently described Sweden’s lawsuits against him as intrigues orchestrated by his critics.
WikiLeaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that threats had been made against the site.
"Calls have even been made for the murder of Julian Assange."
That is why Assange is particularly concerned about his safety, Hrafnsson said.
This is also why the founder of Wikileaks continues to hide.
Hrafnsson was clearly reacting to statements made in North America.
In America, former Arkansas Republican Governor Mike Huckabee demanded that those responsible for the WikiLeaks revelations be prosecuted and executed for treason.
In Canada, adviser to Prime Minister Stephen Harper said on television, ironically, that Mr Assange should "be killed" and that Mr Obama could "use a drone".
Meanwhile, a controversy has erupted between the White House and Mr. Assange.
Robert Gibbs, a spokesman for US President Barack Obama, called it “ridiculous and absurd” that Assange demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hilary Clinton if she was responsible for the order given to diplomats, and recently disclosed, to engage in espionage activities.
“I don’t know exactly why we have to deal with the opinion of an individual who owns a website,” Gibbs says.
“Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than the claims of a website.”
The U.S. government is now completely testing the protection of its databases.
According to a White House statement, Mr. Russell Travers, deputy director of the Center for Counter-Terrorism, was named responsible for fighting the leaks.
Mr Travers is tasked with putting in place the “necessary structural reforms” made necessary after WikiLeaks’ disclosure of the diplomatic cables.
The White House also has the will to verify the means by which the entire administration exchanges and protects information.
In addition, the U.S. government has announced that it wants to take care of the safety of dissidents and activists should they ever be threatened by Wikileaks revelations.
"We have made every effort to get in touch with them," State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said.
“We are ready to protect them if necessary.”
The University of the Ice
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice confectioners are prepared for the best seasons of the year.
The three-day initiation course for future glaciers was very successful and attracted visitors from all over the world.
By the way, where did all the ice come from?
The glacier and the ice machine.
The glacier, that is to say in German the somewhat old-fashioned ice confectioner, manufactures the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of ice-making.
The ice turbine removes the ice cream from the refrigerated display case with a spatula, places it in the waffle, and then starts selling it.
To find out, one does not need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about ice, can not avoid "Gelato-University" of the Italian firm Carpigiani.
The manufacturer of ice cream machines founded the Ice University in 2003 so that the ice creams released from its machines everywhere meet the high Italian ideals.
The three-day initiation course for future glaciers was very successful and attracted visitors from all over the world.
Special chocolate ice cream classes are also offered over several days, and hands-on sessions are held in the private ice cream parlor.
In the midst of the mid-40s crisis, a number of people are dreaming of a new career, others are simply risking their burning desire on the smooth ice.
This time, 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia to Hungary.
Jacky, an art education teacher from California, is a fan of the Slow Food movement and wants to offer a quality European product in the future in the country of Industrial Ice.
Anke from Berlin is a business management consultant and she wants, after a few years, to get something unique out of this nerve-racking job.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening a ice cream shop in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil would like to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian housekeeper came because her children love Italian ice cream.
The master glacier Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal characteristics of perfect ice.
Not only good taste, but also silky suppleness and good consistency are decisive.
However, Luciano does not forget during the training the icing on the cake of the national and, in general, southern superstructure: "Italian ice cream is simply the best: and then it still retains a hell of a dose of romanticism."
The first step in manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano pours the basic ingredients, such as milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixer that heats everything to 85 degrees thanks to an electronic program, then immediately cools to four degrees.
He then opens a tap installed on the machine: a pasteurized base white cream comes out, the foundation of all kinds of milk ice cream.
The trainer is immediately assailed by the question: Is it possible to make ice using only natural substances without stabilizer?
How can one give free rein to the personal pleasure of experimentation?
Mr. Luciano warns against being misled by the spirit of the time.
The one who only talks about ice cream "made from natural ingredients", may have nevertheless used stabilizers: most often a natural product, for example, guar seed flour obtained from guar bean.
It is obviously possible to make ice without using a stabilizer, only it must be sold within 24 hours, otherwise it collapses and the customer will not crunch anything other than ice pellets.
Some modifications of the basic mass are allowed.
This becomes more exciting with the aromas.
Master Luciano establishes the difference between the ingredients that one acquires in the fruit or confectionery department of the supermarket.
In addition, there is powder and pasta.
"suppliers will all try to pass you dozens of flavored ingredients."
"However, you should just try."
Either in the recipes of fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or in ice creams made from the white base mass which, by adding eggs, becomes a yellow cream and is, when cocoa powder is added, the basis of all possible desserts to chocolate.
Now all participants in the course must move on to the use of ice machines.
Luciano invites them from time to time to make four kinds of ice cream: vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla flavor or other natural ingredients.
The different kinds of fruit ice cream are also subjected to the same experience.
More aromatic substances, more fruit purees: from the point of view of taste, this is not absolutely better.
The hazelnut ice cream does not necessarily have the taste of nuts, when it consists largely of hazelnuts.
The kiwi ice cream, very popular, is made from the group using more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
“Only a well-balanced mixture can give the taste of an ice cream,” says Luciano.
Ice making is a calculation exercise: if you use peach puree with a lot of sugar, you need to reduce the amount of sugar in the basic recipe.
A sugar supplement is needed for lemon ice cream.
Luciano presents an apparatus with which he determines the sugar content of the different types of fruit (winegrowers use it to measure the degree of Oechsle in grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make the calculations easier.
The manufacture of ice no longer requires, as in the past, as much physical intervention.
It is not only the automatic manufacturing machine of the basic mass that helps.
There is also an apparatus in which the mixture of ice available is simultaneously beaten to make it unctuous and brought back to negative temperatures.
Despite all automations, slight breakdowns are not excluded.
Brazilian Gustavo dabbles in fruit puree from head to toe and thus splashes his fellow students when control of the colossal mixing bowl eludes him.
Master Luciano is of the opinion that "such an incident is likely to occur during each course: it is only a matter of time."
Controllers in an ambiguous position
According to some sources, the industry experimenting with the cultivation of genetically modified plants has formed a nucleus of the European Food Safety Authority.
This accusation is now made by the Testbiotech expert group which is considered an independent institute for the assessment of the consequences of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we've got a lot of information," Christoph Then, director of Testbiotech, said in Munich on Wednesday.
There are reports that the chairman of the EFSA expert group on genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and other EFSA experts are under contract with the Ilsi lobby group.
The latter is funded by groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé or Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper has been instrumental in the development of the EFSA test requirements for genetically modified plants and is therefore clearly in a conflict of interest situation, according to criticisms made by Mr. Then.
The provisions drawn up correspond verbatim, by paragraph, to the positions taken by the Ilsi pressure group and thus bear the mark of the industry which, in essence, would be controlled by the authorities based in Parma, Italy.
This is already the second time that Testbiotech has denounced a conflict of interest.
A high-ranking EFSA official recently joined the Swiss agri-food group Syngenta unconditionally or without a transitional period, changing sides in the process.
Not long ago, even the Central German Radio (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) revealed the existence of personal relations between the EU control authority and the industrial lobby, which aroused the suspicions of both the German Federal Environment Agency and MEPs.
However, EFSA does not admit the existence of any conflict of interest.
One view is that all reliable data is used, including industry data, as long as it is of good professional quality.
Experts working on behalf of EFSA are not prohibited from making contact with this sector of activity.
But they should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper admits that he works for the U.S.-based International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI).
This body sees itself as a neutral forum bringing together experts from the fields of science, industry and policy, among others, to assess the risks of biotechnology without being in the balance of a lobby.
In this case, independent experts such as Mr. Then disapprove of the fact that genetically modified plants are accepted without any feeding trials in animals and that the impact of these plants on the environment has not been tested.
"We want to know what, for example, the impacts of GM maize cause in the field," says Mr. Then.
The current practice is to test only isolated proteins and not the whole genetically modified plant, which does not allow reliable results to be obtained.
"If you don't look for the risks, then how can you find them?" asks Mr. Then in an accusatory tone.
This is also the view of Mrs Angelika Hilbeck.
She has been conducting research in genetics since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich Polytechnic.
In this region as in the United States, and now also in Europe, the industry sector is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists.
Therefore, there are hardly any researchers who are not related to societies.
In the view of the companies, the critical studies would not be published.
Hilbeck says that "industry controls safety research."
The trace of stone
Uli Gsell bought it, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday afternoon, she was standing in front of the Stuttgart train station with her tube on her back.
There was a Manifest.
It was snowing.
The story is known: In September, the excavators had come and started demolishing much of the north wing.
The world of Stuttgart was no longer the same: Several thousand people demonstrated against the S21 project, the transformation of Stuttgart Central Station into an underground station that will cost several billion.
Much of the wing was in ruins when the protests brought construction to a halt.
Broken into 6000, 7000 pieces.
The Muschelkalk (shell limestone) of Crailsheim, a soft and rough cobblestone badly built between 1914 and 1920.
Mr. Gsell is a 43-year-old sculptor living in Ostfildern.
He found some fragments of it.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
He enthusiastically declares: "a modest and cheap rock, simple and terrestrial."
He said that when he sawed it off, he smelled cigarette smoke.
He still doesn't know what he'll do with that fragment.
The rocks have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The traces of the stones from Stuttgart lead to a former ammunition depot of the French army in a forest near T<0xC3><0xBC>bingen, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
This 44-year-old man trades in old stones.
He bought all the stones from the demolition in Stuttgart.
“It would be a shame if they were crushed or if they disappeared into the landfill,” he said in his office in a hut that was once a guard post.
He says he was subjected to insults and threats when in September newspapers reported that he had bought the rest of the north wing from the demolition company.
But he negotiated for days with opponents of the S21 project.
And he explained to them that there was nothing he could do to oppose the demolition.
And if it takes place, then the most reasonable thing would be to continue to use the stones.
About 200 opponents of the S21 project subsequently took away one of the stone parallelepiped weighing on average 80 kilos whose value is between 6.50 and 14 Euros.
Some keep it as a souvenir in while also hoping to be able to return it during a reconstruction.
Rongen had acquired 500 tons, 25 full loads of a truck.
About half is still crammed into the forest, the rest having long since been sold.
Owners of gardens, landscape gardeners, Individuals.
They came from everywhere and took everything that could get into the trunk and the trailers.
These Stuttgart scandal stones have long since been transformed into "M<0xC3><0xA4>uerle" or limitations of herb beds.
"By the way, this stone is nothing special," Rongen said.
"had not been this political component."
He gets into his all-terrain car, goes around his vast 20-hectare empire.
He studied law and dropped out, and later began to study biology before becoming interested in computer science and eventually becoming a careerist.
And a stone lover.
It stores 40000 tons.
He's amassing treasures all over Germany.
He claims that he is the greatest merchant of ancient stones.
He's holding back.
Artfully carved sandstones are laid on the snow.
"They used to be part of the Marienbr<0xC3><0xBC>cke bridge in Dresden."
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, he says enthusiastically.
"My favorite stone."
He takes the path that goes up through the forest.
It shows a pile of finger: Red sandstone, formerly part of Karlsruhe station.
And so on.
"Nice travertine."
The parallelepiped was once part of the grandstand of the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow of stones and stories, the travertine of Cannstatt from the police prefecture, the reddish granite from the cathedral of St. Blasien, the tuff from the hospital of Heilbronn.
What work, what effort, what sweat!
When Mr. Rongen thinks that once the stones were hand-carved and moved using simple hoists and ox carts, he becomes quite respectful.
"It would be a scandal if such a heritage were to be torn to pieces."
He did not become rich, much less rich.
But the quarry now employs 14 people, and stonecutters, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glassblower and a gardener have settled in the forest.
“We work hard, but it’s rewarding,” says the waste recycler.
Soon, he must go to Cologne.
There are stones to save, too.
The struggle of talents to conquer high potentials
The counter has a large turnout.
16 students are jostling to buy salmon rolls, tomato sauce and white food.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen invited design and mechanical engineering students to a workshop.
As part of a kind of contest of ideas, they must talk business about the car of the future with the designers of VW, and, by the way, get to know the firm Volkswagen.
Nowadays, many companies do not hesitate to go hand-to-hand in the competition to find better brains and to engage, like Volkswagen, in a multifaceted cooperation with universities.
Their mission: Recruit the most gifted graduates as much as possible in the amphitheatres before they arrive on the job market and are wooed by others.
And since universities do not publish statements about the performance of their students, we try to identify exceptional talents in the context of practical projects and retain them.
On the second day of the workshop held at the Technical University of Brauschweig, the automotive group is honing its skills.
A young lady from the staff department shares pens, candy and cards with the Volkswagen logo.
She talks about the schedule of professional internships and student jobs to young talents; she shows them the paths to access the group's premises.
Nico Selle from the Technical University of Braunschweig is responsible for the project with Volkswagen.
For him, there are reciprocal advantages for both parties: "Students come into contact with this industrial sector and gain experience."
“As for the Volkswagen Group, it can get to know the students, take a closer look at the serious candidates and appreciate those who come into play as collaborators.”
According to Mr. Saddle, such cooperation is unusual.
What is new is the offensive with which we seek to attract students.
"In the past, the focus was more on the professional project," says Selle.
The struggle for the conquest of the new graduates will become much more bitter.
In many sectors, companies can no longer recruit their employees by sorting through a variety of candidates.
But they must boast of their reliability and above all woo the highly skilled workforce.
Graduates from the engineering fields are in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the German engineering association VDI, more than 40,000 engineering positions remained unfilled in October.
And according to VDI's forecasts, the vacuum for engineering positions will widen further.
Roman Dykta is on a talent hunt for KPMG, an auditing, accounting and consulting firm.
It organizes expensive events aimed at recruiting talent, such as the KPMG-Race cruise race, a kind of paper rally where competitors must find their way using GPS coordinates.
The company will send eight promising students next year to travel the U.S. in this way.
Participants can visit KPMG's subsidiaries and get to know the company.
The person who has to take part is decided in advance after two selection procedures.
Only the cream of the crop of the many candidates will fly to the United States.
According to Mr. Dykta, the means used for the pursuit of high potentials in universities are increasingly important.
“We want to emerge from the pack through the cruise race.”
"For us, a simple cruise was too little"
For the talent hunter Mr. Dykta, the account seems to be there.
“Until today, we have stayed in touch with everyone who took part in a similar action last year.”
"Some of them are about to finish their studies and want to send their requests to our company soon," he says.
Apart from the direct accommodation carried out on campus, small and medium-sized enterprises proceed in a quite conventional way by participating in trade fairs where they engage in brain-hunting.
"We try to reach graduates by participating in trade shows."
"For example, at the solar technology fair," says Ms. Sitha St<0xC3><0xBC>be, human resources director at Solarworld, a manufacturer of photovoltaic panels.
This Bonn-based company employs around 1500 people in Germany.
Ms. St<0xC3><0xBC>be was aware of the issue of succession.
Currently, 35 positions are being advertised on the company's website.
“Right now, it’s very difficult to fill vacancies.”
“It’s expensive and takes a lot of time,” he said.
Another way to establish contact is through university professors.
Solarworld has established cooperation with various higher education institutions, for example, the University of Freiburg.
"Professors indicate that the student has the opportunity to carry out professional internships or write his graduation project with us."
Expensive advertising campaigns are advertised among solar specialists.
This is why the company tries to advertise by highlighting other qualities: personalized atmosphere, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
"Often a large group can't do that," says St<0xC3><0xBC>be, chief of staff.
Money has long ceased to play the leading role in job search.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good promotion opportunities are the other determining factors.
According to a study conducted by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld is ranked 55th among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The institute is an annual honor roll for German employers.
To this end, it questions employees on their degree of satisfaction with their work and its context while looking at the framework conditions of employees.
The Chief of Staff, Ms. St<0xC3><0xBC>be, hopes that this placement will enhance the company's image among job seekers.
"I think candidates rely mostly on external evaluations with respect to a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from DEBA (Deutscher Employer Branding Akademie, DEBA) advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer by applying a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients to show more authenticity.
And, according to Mr. Kriegler, that means first and foremost taking internal action.
“The best way for an employer to make themselves attractive is through their own employees,” he says.
This is called, according to the jargon used in the sector, the internal image strategy, that is, the creation of the employer's brand image within its own workforce.
"Satisfied employees are the best messengers."
When employees are treated well and identify with the company, they advertise their employer to friends and acquaintances on their own.
“It’s like playing in an orchestra,” says Kriegler.
Obama puts a brake on new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of the southeastern U.S. state of Florida in the coming years.
The Washington government issued a ban an equivalent ban and thus permanently reversed its initial plans.
Even off the Atlantic coast, new drilling remains prohibited for the time being.
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar made the announcement Wednesday.
The explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig in April is at the origin of this strict ban, which must remain in force for at least the next five years.
Faced with this accident that claimed the lives of eleven employees and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and this sector of activity, had indicated that he was willing to authorize the realization of new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
Proponents of this solution thus want to reduce the dependence of the United States on foreign countries in terms of the supply of oil.
The question of who is responsible for the devastating oil spill in golf is not, to date, definitively resolved.
The British oil group, which is facing claims of compensation of several billion, is at the center of the accusations.
A commission of inquiry set up by Obama is due to present its findings in December.
In October, Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar lifted the drilling freeze decreed after the explosion of the platform.
As a result of this decision, various oil groups immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With tighter controls and tougher safety guidelines, Obama and Salazar want to prevent another catastrophe.
The competent supervisory authority, which has discredited itself after many accusations of corruption, is currently undergoing in-depth reforms.
At the same time, Mr. Obama announced that he would eliminate the lucrative tax niches of the gas and oil groups.
The industry is now publicly warning that the supply flow in the Gulf would be significantly lower than it has been so far.
"The government's objective is to put a brake on the rapid growth of the oil and gas sector," according to the result of a current survey carried out in the sector by the audit firm BDO, before the drilling ban pronounced on Wednesday.
Moreover, the American Enery Alliance deplores the uncertainty that characterizes this sector: "No one knows what exactly will change with the regulation."
Investments in new support projects have been postponed until further notice, to the detriment of growth.
Ogoni country is dry
The water flowing in the rivers is oiled brown; it gives off a smell similar to the one that exists in the gas station: Due to a leak, billions of liters of crude oil have destroyed the Ogoni country in Nigeria.
Men live off theft, corruption and oil refining.
Celestine Akpobari has good intentions.
"Don't exhaust yourself," the environmental activist tells reporters to calm them down: "You still have enough oil mud in front of the water lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian tried to photograph a young man sunk in muddy water up to his chest, as well as the greasy trail that surrounds him: This scene looks almost beautiful in the rainbow-colored splash of water.
One cannot notice that the subsoil is full of brown layers of crude oil.
On the bank of the Bodo-Jetty River, Esther Badom reports that she once collected shrimp in whole buckets here.
But in the meantime the calm waters have completely dried up.
Five years ago, a huge amount of oil gushed out of an oil pipeline that exploded in the huge swamp.
Fishermen living in the nearby small town of Bodo now have to row for six hours to reach the fishy waters: The Ogoni country located in the heart of the Niger Delta is considered one of the most polluted regions in the world.
The full extent of the ravages is evident when one walks through mangrove swamps crossed by streams.
Instead of clear water, the motorboat splits brown water, and whoever dips his hand in it removes it all covered with oil.
The small roots of the mangrove emerge from the ground like sticks of licorice. Isolated palm trees sadly let their palms hang down.
We search in vain for the clouds of birds, as we usually find in wetlands: As soon as the outboard engine stops, a ghostly silence falls on this paradise of yesteryear that looks like a gas station by the smell it emits.
"What is happening here is a war on the environment," says Celestine Akpobari with a sad air: "Our life is characterized by a permanent danger with regard to health."
The comparison of wars is made.
The region where the Ogoni live has been a besieged battleground for decades: More than 60 years ago, the first European explorers entered here; the first resistance was organized in the 1980s by the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa. This was later executed. In 1993, the Shell group had to stop its production activities in this region because they had become very dangerous.
Even today, the return to the Ogoni country is forbidden to this company: While more than 2 million barrels of black gold are pumped daily thanks to more than 5000 drilling wells and 7000 kilometers of pipelines in the entire Delta region, three times as large as Switzerland, the oil fields of the Ogoni country are untapped, because the situation there is too large.
Every few hundred meters stand in the water of steel trestles like bizarre sculptures: The heads of boreholes are very affectionately referred to as "Christmas trees".
They are up to 50 years old, most are eaten by corrosion to the mark.
Akpobari believes that a drill head of this nature breaks from time to time in pieces, because a constant flow of crude oil flows into the water.
According to experts, more than two billion liters have been dumped on the ecosystem in 50 years: Each year, the amount of oil equivalent to that which flowed into the sea during the accident of the super-tanker "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago off Alaska, one of the largest environmental disasters in the history of mankind.
Who should bear responsibility for persistent environmental pollution? the answer to this question divides the actors.
For the Shell Group, sabotage and siphoning of oil pipelines are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution, while environmentalists consider drilling head explosions and drilled oil pipelines to be the main causes.
In 2008, the American researcher Richard Steiner criticized the Shell group for applying essentially less stringent safety standards in Nigeria than anywhere else in the world: Only the rate of pipe failures is "even higher than before".
Some forms emerge from the mangroves in a place that, seen from afar, looks like an abandoned workshop, full of camboulis and installed in the open air: They are completely naked and covered with camboulis up to the neck.
A fire sparkles under one of the many barrels that sometimes connected to the pipes, sometimes scattered for no reason on the site must be spotted: a small clandestine refinery.
The crude oil is heated in the barrel for several hours, says Michael, the team leader.
At first, gasoline enters a container by passing through pipes, then, at the end of the pipe, kerosene drops fall and diesel is finally obtained.
This is how Michael and his four collaborators produce four 300-litre diesel drums daily: "This brings us 34,000 Naira", about 22 dollars.
Delta residents are taking advantage of the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil-producing country in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
Illegal refiners can sell at a lower price than the ridiculously low one of barely 40 cents per litre of Diesel: Because they acquire their raw material for free.
This is offered by the "protectors" who put the network of oil pipelines in breach throughout the country of the Ogoni. According to experts, the country loses in this way at least 16 million liters of crude oil throughout the Niger Delta.
Only a very small part of the temporarily stored raw material is illegally purified: Organized crime networks that also include high-ranking politicians and military members, load the lion’s share in tankers and sell it on the world market.
Activist Akpobari considers the debate over whether to attribute the environmental catastrophe or rather subversive activities to the population or the lax mode of production to be purely academic.
“If oil companies were not perceived as intruders and if the foundations of fishermen’s lives were not so deeply destroyed, there would be no sabotage, no theft and no illegal refineries.”
In the meantime, however, the Ogoni's relationship with Shell has deteriorated so much that it was only a matter of withdrawing from the group. "perhaps operators with other nationalities, such as the Chinese, will prove to be better."
Then Michael gets nervous.
"It's high time you got out of the way," announces the sturdy oil worker.
“Soldiers can appear at any time.”
If the illegal refiners are surprised by the special units of the armed forces, they will certainly not be arrested, but at most they will offer them bribes.
Even the soldiers, mostly from the north of the country, want to enjoy the raw material like all Nigerians.
"In every way, this damn thing has brought our country down to a very low level," Akopori said.
Investigators discover construction faults in A380 engines
The A380 clearly suffers from a major safety problem.
While examining an aircraft that made an emergency landing, investigators discovered a possible construction defect that can lead to “catastrophic reactor failure.”
The airline Qantas now wants to file a complaint against the manufacturer of the reactor.
At the beginning of November, the passengers of the Airbus belonging to the company Quantas had been visibly more fortunate so far: During the investigation it conducted, the Australian authority in charge of aviation safety found that the reactors of some A380 aircraft presented a serious safety problem, and it warns against a possible lack of construction.
This potential failure could lead to serious consequences: It can cause fatigue cracks and leaks in the connection of the oil pipe, said in a statement published Thursday by the ATSB administration.
It could have led to a "catastrophic failure of the reactors".
These are the engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce and equipped with 20 aircraft of the A380 series.
The Airbus of the company Quantas, which had to land urgently on November 4 in Singapore, is among them.
The Australian airline has now launched legal proceedings against the British reactor manufacturer.
She filed a legal complaint with an Australian federal court based in Sydney, giving her the opportunity to take further legal action against the company.
Quantas director Alan Joyce said his company would seek damages in connection with the incident in early November.
Parts came loose and the bearing surface was damaged during the engine fire.
According to Rolls-Royce, it is the oil inflammation that is causing the damage.
After this incident, at least 40 reactors now need to be replaced worldwide.
Australian investigators have announced that further safety-related tests will be carried out on the superjumbos that are also equipped with the reactors in question.
The safety recommendations are the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, ASTB spokesman Martin Dolan said.
The security issue is considered to be of sufficient importance to inform all concerned.
Following the emergency landing of its aircraft, the airline Quantas grounded its entire A380 fleet for a week.
Singapore Airlines has temporarily grounded three of its 11 A380s.
As a precautionary measure, Lufthansa has replaced the engine of an A380.
The double-deck aircraft is the largest airliner in the world.
Snowfall across the country causes chaos in transport
Germany all covered in white: In one night, snow fell on almost the whole country.
Chaos reigns on all roads, trains and planes are immobilized.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
Winter makes Germany shiver: By freezing temperatures, almost the entire republic is covered with snow on Thursday night, which leads to chaos in many localities.
In the north and east, the snow cover reaches 15 centimeters in places.
Traffic is severely restricted on several highways and on many roads.
On the national A7 in Flensburg, the winter service staff worked permanently, but they could not cope with the snow that kept accumulating.
In addition, violent gusts swept the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Office for Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (DSH) expects tidal waves to occur off the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein with water levels up to 1.2 m above normal.
Snowpacks on motorways and federal roads have caused serious problems in Saxony.
This is why the Meteomedia bad weather warning centre announced the violet alert level was announced in Saxon Switzerland: in fact, this is the highest level.
In places, 30 centimetres of fresh snow fell and the strong, cool winds dispersed.
Several trucks and cars were stuck there at night.
Even in the state of Saxony-Anhalt, police authorities have reported serious disruptions on the roads.
On the A2 motorway, snow and wind caused traffic disruption and traffic jams.
In Thuringia, snowfall hit the A4 and A9 motorways.
According to the Deutscher Bahn, serious disruptions to rail traffic have occurred in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are: snow on the railways, fallen trees on the railways, catenaries or destroyed needles.
In Saxony, interregional transport between Leipzig and Nuremberg had to be interrupted.
In Sallfeld, Thuringia, an ICE train bound for Munich had to interrupt its journey.
Firefighters and paramedics had to supply the train’s 165 passengers with blankets, food and drinks.
Winds of snow swept the roads.
Snowfall has resulted in numerous flight cancellations at major airports in Germany.
According to a spokesman for the standard and flight information, some cancellations are already announced in Munich.
A Fraport spokesman says 40 flights have already been cancelled in Frankfurt am Main.
The winter service ensures a permanent service.
It is true that passengers stuck at the airport are no longer numerous, despite this barely 400 beds are made available to them.
Accidents occurred on Wednesday afternoon on many roads.
In the evening in Ostholstein, a truck driver lost his life in a collision with a train at a railway crossing.
The driver of the train was slightly injured.
Due to the layers of snow on the roads, a similar accident occurred not far from Nuremberg: even here, a truck was grabbed at a level crossing because the vehicle was immobilized there.
The driver lost his life.
Four passengers were injured in the train, which is why the road from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died when her car barrelled on a slippery road in Aschaffenburg.
However, the meteorologists announce good news: The snow will certainly always be soft and powdery, but it will whirl in case of light gusts.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea will be plagued by strong and fast winds.
However, it is very cold, up to minus 15 degrees in places.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers.
Deutsche Bank is looking to break away from its emblem: According to newspaper reports, the financial institution is looking for buyers for its two office buildings located at its Frankfurt headquarters.
This building could bring in up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank has just embellished the headquarters of the group: The twin towers located in the Business District have been modernized; in the meantime, the bankers have had to return to their old place of service.
From now on, the financial group is clearly looking to recover the costs of renovations and is looking for a buyer for its two buildings, as the newspaper "Financial Times Deutschland" writes, citing a spokesman.
The spokesman did not give the reasons for the planned sale.
He said "we are checking if it is more interesting to occupy the buildings ourselves or sell them, and put them back on rent later".
This is how the largest financial institution in Germany has already given up its seat, shortly after.
It was only in mid-2007 that the bank acquired the Twin Towers for an amount of 272 million euros from equity holders and then rehabilitated them.
The energy optimisation transformations have, according to some indications, swallowed up around EUR 200 million.
A sale would obviously bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to information provided by the newspaper, experts in this sector of activity estimate the value of the towers, renamed in the meantime "Green Towers", at about 500 million euros.
According to the spokesman, it is not currently known whether the buildings will be sold again to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor.
Thousands of people mourn the miners who died.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people had a thought for buried miners who were declared dead as a result of several explosions at a mine.
The bodies had not yet been recovered because the safety situation of the damaged well continues to be precarious.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred at Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 minors between the ages of 17 and 62 had been buried underground.
A probe had been inserted into the wrecked well, but no trace of survivors had been found.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and other explosions that followed, no rescue team was able to descend into the mine for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and the administration had considered that the minors had no chance of surviving.
Until now, the bodies could not be reassembled.
Today, relatives and friends organized a celebration in memory of the dead.
Thousands of people had gathered under the bright sun at Greymouth in the south of the New Zealand island.
They observed two minutes of silence.
In memory of the 29 buried miners, 29 tables were installed on which names, helmets and lamps could be seen.
Photos and personal effects, including clothing and surfboards, also had their place.
The flags were flown at half-mast in front of all public buildings in the country.
New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told participants in the commemorative celebration that New Zealand had cherished the hope that the miners would rise to the surface.
“But they never came home.”
Mr. Lawrie Drew whose son Zen was buried in the pits said he cannot resign himself to accepting his son's death until he has seen his remains.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the commemorative celebration.
Miners of South African and British origin were also buried during the first explosion on 19 November.
Rescuers have started extinguishing a fire inside the coal mine on New Zealand’s South Island.
Police Prefect Gary Knowles told reporters that when the explosive gas masses are moved, the hot temperatures inside the mine begin to drop.
Go to hell, warrior!
Is the Splatter film an artificial film?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the limits of the ancient genre with his film, "Walhalla Rising", the fighter's epic.
What audience did Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think of while shooting “Walhalla Rising”?
A Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) with only one eye is taken prisoner; he frees himself from his executioner and, with an almost supernatural force, eliminates his opponents one after the other. This seems ideal for young male spectators looking for a bloodthirsty action, precisely because our hero is those who use brutal murdering methods, when it seems ideal for the young male spectators to be waiting for a bloody action, precisely because he is using his brutal killing methods.
On the other hand, until the end of the film, the blind man does not say a word about his real name. Even the other characters let escape, at most, at the turn of a sentence or two some terrible cries of agony.
Otherwise, nothing is said and one feasts in the incredibly beautiful mountainous landscape of Scotland that constitutes the scenery of the universe of the Vikings, about a thousand years ago.
This would be ideal plus mature filmmakers with an interest in existentialism and excellent travellings.
When a film targets several target groups, it is a pity that they are mutually exclusive.
The director Winding Refn is considered, since the release of "Pusher", his trilogy relating to the drug dealer fierce and full of style, as a kind of Danish Quentin Tarantin, but he refuses to bring a little more mood to the mainstream or introduce a little less brutality to arthouse cinema.
Most art-cinema sympathizers must experience horror in the face of the brain spreading all around and the intestines.
Action movie lovers die of boredom, when the blind man embarks, for reasons that can be freely interpreted, with a group of violent Christian missionaries on a ship bound for Jerusalem; they are drowned for an eternity by the calm and mist before the crew arrives in America and continues to be silent.
It is no wonder then that "Walhalla Rising" has not found any movie distributors in Germany and that it only exists in DVD format.
It is mainly because of the magnificent images of misery that has deserved some attention, but also because the image of a thrilling film, from time to time, hides behind a pretentious and bloody appearance.
This is not dialogue in this film, nor a coherent action, everything is atmosphere, a fever dream transformed into a film.
The spectator cannot escape it.
Refn barely gives him a moment of relaxation and slowly cuts his throat with icy images and a gloomy soundtrack, but above all with an elusive hatred that springs from the heart of the characters.
Only a young blond boy, who stands faithfully by the side of the blind man, preserves a certain innocence, all the others are animated by anger.
More than anything, the blind hero whose motives are never known, but who returns from hell at any time to fight enemies and temporarily allies by transforming himself into a warrior, is perhaps an envoy of the devil himself.
It represents rotting, but perhaps also, just for those who are, anyway, rotting.
"Walhalla Rising" is an enigmatic film that one can hate or admire, whose purpose is annoyance, enthusiasm and astonishment.
A traumatic experience.
Mysterious earthworks
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new indications regarding a nuclear program developed by Syria.
But this country refuses to take a position on this issue, let alone submit to the agency's controls.
On the night of 5 to 6 September 2007 around midnight, at least four Israeli F-15I fighter jets attacked a mysterious cube-shaped building on Syrian territory.
It is located on the bank of the Euphrates; the largest city located nearby is 30 kilometers away: it is Dair as-Sur.
His name appears in the IAEA documents, because it is about the reactor that Syria built with the help of North Korea in stone parallelepiped, hidden in a valley marked by the absence of electricity.
According to a briefing by the United States intelligence services, the CIA, dating from the end of April 2008, the current reactor, known as the nearby locality, el-Kibar, would be well suited to produce plutonium, which would make it possible to manufacture atomic weapons.
On the other hand, this technique has been valid since the 1950s.
The CIA showed a presentation video featuring blurry satellite images.
Through computer-aided animation, it indicated the probable location of each reactor component before the destruction of the plant, which represents a miniature copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
In addition, she presented the photos showing the building located nearby, or even the interior of it.
It seems that the reactor was about to be put into operation, but it was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombing, there is barely more information available than at the time, and even, with time, the mystery deepens more and more.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that prior to the attack, the CIA was certain that Syria had built a reactor in al-Kibar, but had little evidence that the country was developing “an active nuclear weapons program.”
Some intelligence agents in Europe prefer to be more cautious about this and speak only of an “alleged reactor”, even if they consider the CIA’s presentation as “plausible”.
They lack tangible evidence, as does the IAEA.
Asked how he ensured he was dealing with a nuclear reactor, a senior U.N. diplomat gave only a terse response in the summer when he said the IAEA had “sufficient documents to ask questions.”
The Syrians certainly hurriedly cleared the rubble of the “unused military building” and methodically leveled the ground.
However, in June 2008, a team of IAEA experts led by former chief inspector Oli Heinonen discovered traces of man-made uranium in Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA has received satellite images from commercial service providers showing the moment directly following the attack from a Member State, which appear to be more eloquent than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous sponsor, perhaps Israel, acquired them exclusively.
It is therefore impossible for the IAEA to establish their authenticity objectively.
Syria has always maintained that it has never carried out a secret atomic program and has not built a reactor.
Damascus maintains that the uranium found at the site comes from weapons used by Israel.
But the IAEA rejected this argument after analyzing the particles, calling it implausible.
Since that time, Damascus has refused any discussion about it, as well as about satellite imagery.
In addition, Syria does not allow the controllers to carry out a second inspection at the site of al-Kibar and denies access to the rubble of the building destroyed by the bomb.
But even Israel remains obstinately silent.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then prime minister at the time of the attack, recently said: “We will never comment on this.”
Thus, the investigation into this case has been dragging on since June 2008 without a result and is "increasingly becoming a serious credibility problem for the Agency", as acknowledged by a high-ranking Western diplomat serving at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna, which is ultimately a serious violation of the nuclear weapons ban treaty.
The IAEA considers that to make progress, it is necessary to clarify the existence of the other three facilities that must have a "functional relationship" with the alleged reactor.
To date, the inspectors have not indicated what facilities they are, what their function is, or what they are suspected of containing.
According to information published by the newspaper "S<0xC3><0xBC>ddeutsche Zeitung", they are known within the IAEA respectively under the names of Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariyah also from the names of the neighboring cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington, D.C., identified the locations and discovered a complex near Masyaf on satellite images that is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
It is possible that he is at or directly adjacent to a military base, which is exactly why Syria is denying IAEA inspectors access to the three sites.
In Vienna, it is alleged that the Syrians fear that the inspection group is in fact spies who would be sent on behalf of the United States by the IAEA to spy on military installations.
To tell the truth, it was intelligence provided by American secret agents that caught the attention of nuclear inspectors.
The IAEA has information, including satellite photos, indicating that vehicles have shuttled between the three sites and the stone parallelepiped to transport substances.
A senior Western diplomat said in Vienna that at least one of the facilities could be “used for fuel production.”
It would have “no indication of sensitive activities,” such as uranium enrichment and reprocessing; processes that are indispensable to the production of atomic weapons.
This type of reactor certainly works thanks to unenriched uranium.
Nevertheless, there are plausible hypotheses regarding the following fundamental questions: where the uranium should have come from and where the plutonium needed to make the bomb would have been separated later.
It is unknown whether the rubble, which could hide traces of great value, was stored at all three sites.
When the hundreds of trucks loaded with earth have disappeared, no one will have information on where the rubble is stored.
For the IAEA, it is unlikely that Syria had the al-Tibni salt mine, located only a few kilometers from al-Kibar, on the other side of the Euphrates, examined in 1998 to see if it could be suitable for storing radioactive waste.
In analyzing recent satellite photos taken on behalf of Jane's Intelligence Review magazine, former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley linked them to the reactor in question.
Satellite photos show, however, that Syria undertook earthworks at the three suspected sites and moved huge containers when the IAEA began demanding access to these locations.
It is possible that this was a coincidence, but it did not help to dismiss the suspicions.
It is said in the diplomatic circles that the IAEA has spent several months developing a plan for inspections to be carried out there. This plan was intended to allow Syria to preserve possible military secrets. Only the time invested shows how much interest the inspectors have in this case.
Meanwhile, Damascus has also flouted this proposal.
A year ago, if the Western diplomats in Vienna had not reported the destruction of the reactor, the urgency would not be reported for this case, says, for example, Glyn Davies, the US ambassador who for a few months has been talking about what is known as the special inspections, one of the most powerful means that the Atomic Agency has to implement its controls.
The Director of the IAEA, Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option to which I am open in the future", but he still hesitates.
This means a huge risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors and many of the 35 countries represented there have no desire to see the situation escalate.
On the other hand, as this diplomat who gives to reflect: "To this it would be useful, if in the end they do not find anything"
Love in a Time of War
It’s been going badly since Angelina Jolie made her directorial debut in the summer.
She wrote the script herself: it is a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a man of Serbian origin.
Nothing more is known about this story, but it is enough to cause discomfort.
A persistent rumor indicates that the woman, a Muslim, fell in love with her Serbian executioner during the Yugoslav war.
The Bosnian women's federations immediately protested, and in response, some planned filming in Sarajevo was moved to Hungary at the last minute.
Meanwhile, the film is shot in Hungary, but in the post-production phase, protests are still continuing in Bosnia.
According to information published in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hasecic of the women's war victims organization sent a letter to Angelina Jolie through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and demanded to meet the actress. Jolie herself is a goodwill ambassador for UNHCR.
She is not a diplomat, and a few weeks ago she suggested that these women meet with them in Hungary, but they declined.
"The meeting must be held in Bosnia," Hasecic said.
There have been no love stories in the concentration camps, and Jolie’s script says quite a bit about her attitude toward the victims.
The Guardian reports that Hasecic’s organization subsequently recommended to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights that Angelina Jolie be removed as a goodwill ambassador.
But, by the way, what kind of scenario did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received copies of its script, after some hesitation granted a filming authorization in Sarajevo, but it is not known why it did not come afterwards despite this authorization.
The young author assures herself that she does not pursue political goals with her film, that it is by making a lot of effort that she became aware of the Yugoslav conflict. She maintains that she wants to highlight the terrible consequences of the war and give the opportunity to all stakeholders to express themselves.
However, it remains vague about the content.
This is how a second synopsis of the film circulates on the Net. It is quite different: The lovers knew each other well before the beginning of the war. They meet again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to the Serbian concentration camp where the man works as a guard.
This is a big difference from the "a rape victim falls in love with her executioner" version.
That Jolie's film started long before the war, of course.
The pressure on her, Jolie says, is “unfair and based on misinformation.”
Now, only Hollywood fanatics can bring him peace: by illegally putting this scenario on the Net, like so many others before.
Let's shoot!
All is well with the Irish again.
No trace of consternation.
This is why the local team overpowers visitors from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans howl with joy against a background of strong music, they kick their feet.
Cork Baileyu-Pub in South Ireland vibrates because players throw and manage to drop table tennis balls at a distance of three meters into beer cups of the opposing team.
This bizarre show is called "beer-pong". The winner pocketed 500 Euros plus a plane ticket allowing him to go to attend in January in Las Vegas to the world beer-pong championship.
Cian Tanner is a calm individual; this subtle drinking game and the reserved computer scientist, these two behaviors really do not go well together.
And yet, despite this, the 26-year-old seeks to have fun, to turn away from the terrifying question, which will lead to the future.
The pleasure of playing in Las Vegas does not figure in his plans. In January, he will lead job interviews in New Zealand.
“I have a strange feeling,” he says.
"The native country is so far away and I have no job there."
Finally: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland, "in less than two, she got her desired job as an event project manager, perhaps a good sign," says the young man with a smile.
Due to the bleak prospects at home, two of Tanner's three sisters tried their luck abroad.
Her sister Yvonne, a social worker, lives in Sydney, her brother Colin now works as a computer consultant in London.
The situation of most of the families living on the island is similar to that of the tanners.
Experts from the Institute for Economic and Social Research say 100,000 Irish will soon be leaving their country.
They are even forecasting 200,000 emigrants by 2015.
This represents a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 million people.
If these forecasts come true, it will be a flow of emigration comparable to that which Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom during which the Irish enjoyed great ease, grief now takes its place.
The economic crisis, however, is especially affecting well-trained young Irish people, who have so far experienced only moments of happiness.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone had a job, there is excess money.
But, in the meantime, three out of ten people under the age of 30 are unemployed.
The Irish Times abundantly publishes the letters of readers written by young emigrants, who complain: "In Ireland, everything goes adrift."
“There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but the one who has the possibilities, is leaving and our country is leaving for a whole generation.”
"The last one to leave turns off the light."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Students Union, sees a bleaker future because the government is just throwing powder in the eyes and offers no prospects for young people.
“They are lowering minimum wages, but they have no strategy for creating new jobs,” says the 20-year-old student.
She sees how her classmates cling from one unpaid practical internship to another.
She states that her biggest concern is to emigrate herself in four years.
“It’s a sad and depressing thought.”
However men like Stephen McLarnon try to approach this topic positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo" which offers full support on the theme "working abroad".
"But work abroad is an extraordinary opportunity for those new to the profession to take the first steps in the professional hierarchy," says the official.
Its website shows pictures of surfers in Australia and snow surfers in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a hassle, but it also guarantees freedom and fun.
For the past six months, Seán O'Donovan has known what it means to be based elsewhere.
As there was nothing left to do in Ireland for this 29-year-old engineer, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction sector in Germany.
A fashion house comes out of the ground in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he will continue to work on other projects in Hannover or Berlin.
Meanwhile, O'Donovan rarely visits his native country, as he participates in an additional job, in order to be able to complete the repayment of the credit contracted to build his house in the native country.
“The situation is already a bit crazy,” he says, crossing the threshold of his house for the first time after a long time.
“I make money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I practically don’t live anymore.”
He bursts out with an embarrassed laugh as he walks through the cold rooms.
The small house is located in a residential area with well-groomed front gardens, expensive cars of major brands are parked on the access roads.
Four years ago, O'Donovan bought the house jointly with his sister for 380,000 Euros, financed 100 percent by credit.
“These were moments of madness, without a doubt, money was easy,” he says.
Is he afraid of seeing everything fall apart because of credit?
O'Donovan thought for a moment, sipped hot tea and said, "I have no children to care for and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch."
The building engineer does not like the lamentations he often hears lately.
“No one should suffer from hunger, our situation is still not as dramatic as what we once experienced here on the island,” he said.
“Working for a while abroad is not the worst thing that can happen, maybe that’s what makes us feel Irish first.
He laughs and then talks about his father who went to England during the last great economic crisis.
“He was back after seven years, and in Ireland, life was just going on.”
This idea appeals to Cian Tanner.
Leave the future and find out how life goes elsewhere.
He already has a few years of work in London, which is why life in New Zealand shouldn't be so easy for him and his girlfriend.
But there is still one thing that worries him in recent days: the party to be organized on the occasion of his 27th birthday in Dublin.
He's afraid it might turn into a farewell party.
“Only, not a lot of emotions,” he says while sipping a long sip of beer.
“Farewell, that sounds scary.”
“Let’s call it a relaxed farewell party with a few friends, a few drinks and a few games.”
The Democratic Routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to grow, as does support for private enterprise.
Crime has become a bigger concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States in much of the region.
These are some of the conclusions of the latest Latinobar<0xC3><0xB3>metro survey taken in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been conducted on a regular basis since 1995, it tracks changes in attitudes in the region.
Two related elements emerge from the results of this year's survey, conducted in September and early October.
The first is the rather sunny mood of Latin America.
The second is the increasing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries around the South American Pacific (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% per year since 2002, support for democracy has risen from a low of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also rose in Mexico, where the economy recovered after suffering a sharp drop in output last year.
But only about half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the region, are convinced Democrats, which lowers the regional average (see Table 2).
Some 44 per cent of respondents in the region said they were satisfied with the way their country's democracy worked in practice; this is the same figure as last year but with a sharp increase from 25 per cent in 2001 (Chart 3).
Some 34% said they had confidence in their country's parliament and 45% in their government, the same as last year in both cases; but up sharply from 2003 (respectively 17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, economic problems in Latin America undermined support for democracy.
If this has held up during the global financial crisis, it is certainly due to the fact that many countries in America have experienced only a brief recession and have benefited from a strong recovery.
In addition, a social security network has helped to protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty increased only slightly in 2009 and fell again this year, to 32 percent.)
But the mood varies considerably from country to country (see Figure 4).
Brazil’s good economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, translates into a widely shared sense of progress.
This is rarer in Mexico and Central America, where the recession has been more severe and violent crime has worsened.
It is only for the second time since the survey began that more respondents across Latin America as a whole cited crime rather than unemployment as the most important problem for their country (see Table 5).
About 31% say they or a loved one have been the victim of a crime in the past year; however, this figure is down from 38% last year and is the lowest since 1995.
A more robust economic performance is reflected in the rise in support for private enterprise and the market economy: around 71% of respondents in the region say that private enterprise is indispensable for development, up from 56% in 2007 (see Graph 6).
Some 58% believe that the market economy is the only system that will make their country developed, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela are of this opinion (and 80% support private enterprise); even though their leftist president, Hugo Chavez, expropriates many private companies.
Brazil is the largest leader in the region, mentioned by 19% of respondents (up from 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged from last year) and Venezuela (9%, down 11% from last year)
But the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and most of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A dirty vote
No one expected to have a perfect general election in Haiti on November 28.
But it was far worse than the outsiders who wanted to help the country that was devastated and in fear.
Boxes of ballots and a new ballot were presented, ballots scattered in the gutters, polling stations ransacked and intimidation
The polling stations opened late at night.
Many Haitians, including many who were displaced by the January earthquake, wandered the neighborhood to find a place to vote.
Some of them eventually gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several alleged favorites, denounced the fraud and demanded the cancellation of the election.
Protests, sometimes violent, have exploded across the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the senior official in Haiti of the United Nations, considers the event as "a fairly good election in many respects".
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community cautiously stated that they “do not believe that these irregularities, however serious, necessarily invalidated the process.”
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opponents are indebted to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, is due to announce preliminary results on December 7.
The second round is scheduled for January.
All hope in the election is not lost.
The two opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rap musician, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, withdrew from their initial call for the vote to be declared void.
But there may be problems if Mr Célestin, who has little or no perceptible support among voters, is declared by the electoral authority to have reached the second round and reached the second round.
With a cholera epidemic raging, and more than 1 million earthquake survivors still living in tents, it was feared that participation would be.
In this case, many Haitians wanted to vote but were prevented from doing so due to disorganization.
Nearly 250,000 ID cards needed to vote had not yet been distributed shortly before the election.
The stakes are high.
Donors see the election of a popular and legitimate government as an important step in rebuilding Haiti.
And so, of course, the Haitians do it themselves.
The tip of the feet towards the center
In the weeks after suddenly becoming a widow, Argentina’s President Cristina Fernández benefited from a wave of public sympathy that improved her approval rating by 20 points to more than 50 percent, her highest level since she was elected in 2007.
Yet turning this into a successful campaign for a second term in an election next year could depend on Ms. Fernández, visibly in mourning, choosing whether or not to abandon the intransigence of her late husband, predecessor and former political partner, Nestor Kirchner.
And, in this regard, the signs remain confused.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to manage economic policy even after his wife succeeded him as president, used to craft budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend the extra income at will.
Fernandez’s government lost its majority in Congress last year, on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation has sunk into disarray following Mr Kirchner's death from a heart attack on 27 October.
Some of the dissident members of the Peronist movement in power rallied to Ms. Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (where a congressman punched one of his peers in the face and others accused the government of corruption), Congress does not have to approve the 2011 budget.
“I’m not going to argue,” the president said.
Currently, the 2010 budget will be implemented next year, leaving the president even more leeway to spend at will.
The economy is vastly overheating: it is likely to grow by nearly 9% this year.
The official inflation rate now stands at 11.1% but many private estimates and union wage demands, see this figure close to 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina feared an economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction a priority, rather than inflation control.
He refused to deal with the IMF, he harassed the private sector and purged INDEC, the statistical office, which carried out falsifications of official inflation statistics.
Can Mrs Fernández now moderate these policies?
She called for talks between private companies and union leaders.
And its officials say they want to limit next year’s salary increases to 18 percent.
The economy was boosted by high world prices for Argentina's agricultural exports.
But inflation eroded the boost to growth following a sharp devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps that is why Mrs Fernández is showing signs of wanting to restore Argentina's financial relations with the rest of the world.
This year, the government reached an agreement with bondholders who had refused a previous forced debt restructuring for which Argentina had not settled its maturities in 2001.
Now Ms Fernández seems to be edging towards an agreement with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it owes some $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have always insisted that this could not involve IMF surveillance, as is customary.
But last month, Economy Minister Amado Boudou announced that the Fund would provide “technical assistance” to design a new national consumer price index; which looks like a prelude to INDEC’s clean-up.
It is not clear whether Ms. Fernández wants to stay in politics beyond the end of her term, now that her husband is no longer at her side.
If it does, it needs to win the support of the middle class, among which Kirchnerism is very much advocated.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have ebbed.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether or not to quietly repudiate many of her husband’s policies.
Half a hurrah for China
Taiwanese voters have turned to a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother across the strait?
More than 7.5 million voters turned out on November 27, or 70% of eligible people, to elect mayors and city councilors in five urban districts, as part of what is seen as a general assessment by President Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself has become a surrogate for sentiments toward the continent, having forged innovative business ties, including a partial free trade pact, in the largest reorganization of relations with China proper since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but only just.
Although his Kuomintang (KMT) party won three of the five town halls, it failed to win a majority of the votes.
Instead, the Democratic-Progressive Party (DPP), which leaned toward full independence from Taiwan, won nearly 50% of all votes for the 45% KMT.
If this had been a presidential election, Mr. Ma would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party’s share of the vote has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP attracted voters, even with the KMT in the municipal councils.
The event unveiled most of the main topics of the Taiwanese elections, including loud-campaigning trucks and mass-gathering flags with girls dancing in minimal attire.
A mandatory assassination attempt has also been carried out.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary president of the KMT, carried out an electoral tour for a KMT candidate on the eve of the election.
A man from the crowd shot the young Mr. Lien, purely through the face, wounding him and killing a passerby.
Oddly, it was not determined whether the shooter intended to harm Mr. Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
In any case, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PDP, the murder had consequences on the election by directing suspicion on the DPP and turning voters to the KMT.
Perhaps the biggest winner in the election was China.
It was striking how absent the question of the mainland itself was.
Instead, candidates jostled with plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates China's military threat.
Thus, the KMT tends to avoid parading its ties with the Beijing government.
But this time, the DPP also refrained from fanning anti-Chinese sentiment.
It is a response to a new awareness that Chinese companies are indispensable to Taiwan’s economic survival.
Ma, for his part, demanded confirmation as to whether his China policy was acceptable to the Taiwanese majority.
The Beijing government can be expected to continue to provide trade facilities, in line with its strategy to lure Taiwan back to the fold.
China wasted no time sending a negotiator to Taipei to hold a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Admittedly, it would also like to see political integration; but let’s start from the beginning.
Better to wait for that after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has reinvented itself anyway.
Two years ago, it was going badly: its former leader, Chen Shui-bian, had been sent to prison on corruption charges.
President from 2000 to 2008, he was a provocateur in favor of explicit independence.
But a new generation of moderates has emerged under Ms. Tsai’s leadership and the PDP is making every effort to attract professionals and youth.
Ms. Tsai was hailed as a DPP presidential candidate, like Su Tseng-chang, who served under Mr. Chen.
Their party is doing its best to show that it too can engage with Beijing.
Tsai announced plans for a panel of experts to act as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided their talks can take place without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party presents a “trustworthy alternative” to Mr. Ma’s hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems exasperated by this change.
In a statement released from his cell, he said PDP candidates would have performed better if they had insisted that Taiwan is a separate country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to run for the presidency.
Even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will have a hard time choosing between its potential candidates.
The KMT needs to do an introspection of itself.
Mr. Ma's assessments were weak; despite dizzying economic growth, the KMT candidates did not want to campaign with him.
Its unpopularity seems to be largely due to unemployment and the widening gap between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesman says his cabinet and local offices will be reshuffled.
The good results of the PDP suggest that Taiwan’s support for rapprochement is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "the point of no return is already past."
Grammy nominations: jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise selected in the category "best new artist"
Perform at the request of a president, and people are required to take notice of it.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer handpicked by President Obama to perform at his Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in 2009, marked one of the surprises of the Grammy Awards this year with a high-profile nomination in the category of “best new artist.”
Considering Spalding has been a well-known figure on the jazz scene since his 2008 album "Esperanza", the nomination remains somewhat mysterious but it is consistent with Grammy Award rules that an artist should not release more than three albums prior to recording; this "establishes the public identity of that artist."
His ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", certainly marked a step forward and, given his slightly engaging vocal style, his deft hand of pop and funk and his Latin influences, it is possible to draw at least a dotted line in Spalding compared to Norah Jones's meteoric success in 2003, the closest equivalent of this Grammy Award-winning production in recent years.
Elsewhere, Grammy Award voters have rightly honored Vijay Iyer Trio’s “Historicity” in the “instrumental album” category, a trip on the invigorating thrill of a recording that was one of the top favorites last year.
Among these Iyer, "Moody 4B" by veteran saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" by keyboardist John Beasley will be in competition.
Trombone Shorty, a raspy New Orleans favorite and frequent guest on HBO's "Treme," was honored in the contemporary jazz category; which also leans heavily toward a certain fusion with the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Darcy James Argue's Wild Secret Society, familiar with steampunk, won some well-deserved recognition in the big ensemble category; competing with Billy Childs' rich chamber-jazz ensemble and eternal adventurer Dave Holland whose "Pathways" album from his live octet was a fine example of this bassist's democratic hand as bandleader.
Grammy Award Nomination: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey Lead in Classic Categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd annual Grammy Awards feature a mix of landscapes from musicians and composers from around the world.
Leading the nominations are Michael Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina," for piano and orchestra, with five "yeses"; and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse," an electric orchestral work, with three "yeses."
Among the nominees with ties to Southern California is Estonian composer Arvo P<0xC3><0xA4>rt for his Symphony No. 4, “Los Angeles,” a work that was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and opened the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The Madolin Concerto by Los Angeles-based composer Avner Dorman is also in the running for an award.
The classical nominations are divided into 13 categories covering orchestral, opera, choral and solo recordings.
A category for Classic Producer of the Year features five nominees: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Nominations for the classic album include Bruckner's Symphonies No. 3 and 4 of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey's "Dreamhouse" of the Boston Modern Orchestra Various Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrifium" of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; and "Sacrifium" of the Art of the Boston Modern Orchestra.
In the category of opera, the nominees are "Lulu" by Berg of the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House, "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Adolf Hasse of the Ars Lyrica Houston; "L'Amour de Loin" by Kaija Saariaho of the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; "The Enchanted Wanderer" by Rodion Shchedrin's BBC Orchestra and "The Enchanted Wanderer" of the Berlin Symphony.
Composers who are in place for the Grammy Awards for contemporary composition include P<0xC3><0xA4>rt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appasionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Wanderer Enchanted".
P<0xC3><0xA4>rt's Symphony No. 4 had its premiere at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a performance recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The approximately 30-minute work is nicknamed "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" was nominated for his instrumental solo performance with an orchestra.
The Los Angeles-based composer said he is soon writing the 15-minute work especially for mandolin performer Avi Avital, who played the concerto with the New York-based Metropolis Ensemble.
“I wrote it using Middle Eastern sounds and a lot of North African scales and rhythms,” Dorman said in a phone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the orchestral performance category for conducting the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Instrumental soloists nominated include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year, there are only female vocalist-soloist nominees; here they are: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucie Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category of classical mixes, soprano Jessye Norman received a nomination for her recording "Roots: My Life, My Song"
The Temecula Mosque project wins the approval of the planning commission.
A mosque project in Temecula received unanimous support from the local planning commission after more than five hours of public, often impassioned testimony.
Critics attacked the project, claiming that it promoted both terrorism and traffic jams.
But the commissioners ruled Wednesday night that the new religious center respected local laws and would be aesthetically impressive.
"A lot of good people have come to support it: Christians, Jews, Baha'is, you mention it," said Hadi Nael, president of the Temecula Valley Islamic Center, speaking Thursday morning.
"I'm proud of that, as an American citizen."
"It shows that justice prevails."
“The opposition is really minimal,” he added.
“They just have very strong voices.”
"We have good people in this valley."
The session began at 6 p.m. and lasted until almost midnight with, most of the time, people speaking for or against the center, with speaking time roughly evenly distributed, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper’s website.
“There is no more America,” one speaker wrote.
"This is another planet of monkeys with Miss Liberty dead in the sand."
“America has fallen.”
Planned Islamic centers have also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including at Ground Zero, the site of the September 11, 2001 attacks in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmoush denounced violence in the Temecula Valley.
Her congregation of about 135 families has co-existed without incident in Riverside County for years but she wanted a larger and better space than the warehouse she rented on a property shared with a manufacturer of water filtration systems.
The new 24,943-square-foot mosque with Mediterranean-style architecture would consist of two minarets and rise to 43 feet in height.
It would occupy a 4.32-hectare site on Route Nicolas about two miles east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal against this project to the city council.
An arsenic-tolerant microbe raises the possibility of new types of life on Earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacterium, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, widens the field to find new forms of life on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Although researchers have discovered the unusual bacteria here on Earth, they say it shows that life has possibilities beyond the major elements that were considered essential.
"This organization has a double capacity."
"It can develop either with phosphorus or with arsenic."
"That's why it's very special, even though it's far from a truly 'foreign' life form," said Paul Davies C. W. of Arizona State University, co-author of the report in Thursday's online edition of the journal Science.
Six major elements have long been considered essential for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur.
But the researchers found that the bacterium, discovered in Mono Lake, California, is able to continue to grow after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
“One wonders what is still possible,” said Ariel Anbar D. of Arizona State University, a co-author of the report.
The discovery is important in the search for life beyond Earth because researchers need to be able to recognize life, to know what life looks like, Anbar says.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss it, which did not divulge the details of the find, has generated widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could divulge the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
That was not the case.
The discovery "shows that, in other planetary environments, organisms might be able to use other elements to drive biochemistry and that the 'standard' set of elements, which we deem absolutely necessary for life, might not be fixed," said Charles Cockell, a professor at the Institute for Planetary and Space Science Research, Open University, Milton Keynes, UK.
Cockell wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is novel because it shows the substitution of one element to another in fundamental biochemistry and biochemical structure," Cockell added.
It was not a fortuitous discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's Institute of Astrology, who led the study, chose Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar; thus, she speculated that a microbe exposed to the two substances might be able to substitute for each other.
“Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is really similar to that of phosphorus.”
"As a result, organisms have difficulty distinguishing these elements separately."
“But arsenic is different enough that it doesn’t work exactly like phosphorus; it gets inside and sort of erases the work of our biochemical machine,” Anbar explained.
The researchers collected the bacterium known as GFAJ-1 and exposed it to increasing concentrations of arsenic to which it was able to adapt and grow.
The microbe grows best with phosphorus but the fact that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that a life form using arsenic can occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said the idea that arsenic could be replaced by phosphorus was not new; but nothing ever showed that it could work.
Arsenic was more common early in Earth’s existence, she says, so researchers have speculated that early life could have used it.
This suggests that there might be other ways to form life, not just the way life on Earth was formed in the beginning,” said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon’s research team.
The research was funded by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institute of Health.
Last two stolen show dogs found in Compton
The other two show dogs on four stolen from outside a Bellflower motel were found, Los Angeles County sheriffs announced Thursday.
The four show dogs — two akitas and two Welsh Pembroke corgis — went missing Tuesday when someone stole the Chevrolet Express pickup truck in which they had spent the night outside a Bellflower Motel 6, authorities said.
Two of the dogs were recovered Wednesday afternoon and the other two were found late Wednesday evening, Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department spokesman Steve Whitmore told reporters.
“The good news is that the dogs are doing well,” Whitmore says.
“They are in good shape.”
"They have been returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore declined to say precisely where the dogs had been found, in what neighborhood, and what the circumstances of their discovery were.
"An investigation is underway."
“We don’t want to say it,” Whitmore said.
"We follow orders."
Owners Kristina Rickard and David Peek could not be reached for comment Thursday.
They were reunited Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas at a county animal shelter in Downey.
Sheriff's deputies found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
The Akitas — Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female — were safe, authorities said.
But Bunny and Peter, the corgis that Rickard and Peek had planned to show at regional competitions this week, on behalf of the owners of the Japanese dogs, were missing until their discovery Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend as part of the AKC/Eukanuba Long Beach National Championship, where they planned to host Trace.
The other dogs were expected to compete in other events scheduled in the days leading up to the “AKC/Eukanuba” exhibition, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops on the couple’s nearly month-long dog show tour.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked into the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their van outside, right next to their bedroom window.
They took three other dogs – a Boxer puppy, a Parson Russell terrier and a Breton spaniel – who stayed with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and the corgis, with thicker fur, in the van where it would be cooler.
They opened the windows a bit, so the dogs could get some fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the van stolen at 6 a.m.
Peek said they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the corgis, fitted with a microchip implanted to identify them.
It is not clear if a prize was awarded on Thursday.
The lion is ready to blush again, the restructuring of MGM is waiting for the final green light from the court
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light to start over.
A federal bankruptcy judge in New York on Thursday officially praised the creditors’ “pre-packaged” plan that would clear about $5 billion of debt, paving the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to focus its efforts on producing and distributing movies and TV shows.
With Thursday’s decision that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, no legal hurdles remain for MGM to recover under the tutelage of Entertainment Spyglass founders Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the CEOs of what will be a lean studio.
Staff will be reduced to about 320 out of 400 initially.
MGM will not actually emerge from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase enters into a $500 million credit facility to fund MGM’s new operations and productions.
It is currently being licensed by the investment bank, which is struggling with $75 million, and is expected to be funded by mid-December.
The studio’s restructuring process began in May 2009 when investment bank Moelis & Co. was hired to advise management on how to place its finances as it could not afford to pay the $300 million per year interest.
In August, CEO Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former Enron CEO and recovery expert known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper’s attempts to resolve MGM’s financial difficulties and satisfy the studio’s more than 140 creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed at the end of 2009 to put the company up for sale.
However, the auction attracted few bidders, none of whom were willing to pay the additional $2 billion sought by creditors.
In the spring of this year, everything had to be done again as the MGM team had begun work on a restructuring plan that, after months of disagreements and internal debates, was finally approved by creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially exited bankruptcy in the following weeks, the Moelis and Cooper companies received multi-million dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already raised $1.2 million, will receive a $9.5 million payment.
Cooper’s companies, which have raised $375,000 per month for their corporate management services, will receive a “success premium” of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plans to revive MGM’s production, which has only released one film this year, and put together an annual list of seven or eight films that would be released starting in 2012.
They also plan to co-finance two films based on “The Hobbit” with Warner Bros.
The studio must make a separate loan between $265 million and $275 million to finance its share in these two films, which are to be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who holds about 18 percent of MGM’s debt, has attempted to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the main shareholder.
However, recent discussions between the two companies have not resulted in an agreement.
Tech toys to keep your gift budget in balance
Although the top contender for this year’s most wonderful toy is the iPad, followed, perhaps, by Microsoft’s video game system, Kinect, both can make a significant dent in your gift budget.
Consider that, for the price of an iPad, you can buy five $99 BMX bikes, and that a Kinect game costs the same price as 10 classic jump ropes of beads, or about 48 boxes of Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
Recently, I visited three national toy sellers - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club - to see the electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
Clearly Moore’s Law has evolved, this year’s tech toy is likely to have more force; while costing the same price if not a little less, compared to last year.
Also, while there are generally fewer new toys associated with websites, two of the more well-known of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And button battery toys are on the rise, as well as rechargeable battery toys.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise noted.)
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for 3 years and older) are stuffed toys the size of a guinea pig that sing a note when you squeeze them on the belly.
One pressure is equal to one note, and a second allows you to compose a song.
If you buy several, they will sing in harmony.
Warning: once you start to press, you can’t stop.
To combine singing with dancing, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, $60 for 2 years and over) is the best choice.
Taking inspiration from last year’s Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays turn-based games like Simon Says and can do the moon dance thanks to its innovative wheel-locking articulating feet.
Children who have tried the toy use Mickey as a dance instructor while their parents complain of a lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you will remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
He’s back (Hasbro/Playskool, $40 for 3+ years), with a backpack filled with quiz game cards designed to turn a ride in car into a session with self-correction and a valve binder.
If you’re suspicious when your child is holding your smartphone, here are three stand-alone alternatives.
The VTech Mobigo ($60, for 3 to 8 year olds) is the cheapest and easiest to use, with a qwerty keyboard, although the games do not educate as effectively as the Leapster Explorer ($70, for 3 to 12 year olds), it is the first major overhaul of the Leapster range, with a newer and brighter display.
No version is compatible with older cartridges.
The Fisher-Price iXL ($90, for ages 3-7) uses an iTunes-like system to offer games and e-books, and comes with an SD card input that lets you view family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for ages 8 and up) is a set of five blocks barely bigger than a matchbox, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to form words by placing the blocks online before time runs out, this is ideal for an impromptu spelling contest.
More and more, toys have some kind of online connection.
Based only on their presence in toy stores, the two biggest ones are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child a Club Penguin pet online, for example, you can get a Penguin Disney Club 2"Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for ages 6-12) that includes a piece marked with a hidden code.
When you redeem the code online, your child receives enough credits at the Club Penguin store for two choice items.
It can be roller skates or a Puffle toy pet.
Slightly larger than the hair at the end of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5+ years) is the latest button-stacked micro-robots.
The fake critter moves quickly over 12 vibrating silicone pastes in random directions.
It is fun to make a maze of blocks to see if she can find her way through.
It is also solid.
Ours resisted a fall from the kitchen table and even a momentary passage in the mouth of our dog.
Bringing a Softer Side to Law Enforcement in China
Tang Shenbin paced a city square like an urban sergeant in training by inspecting his nerve charges severely, issuing orders in a low voice with military authority.
He wanted the female members of chengguan—imposing law enforcement officials in China, feared and despised for their arbitrary repression and penchant for violence—to convey a certain impression to a set of spectators.
"Stand up!"
"Be perceptive!"
Show them, he says, "what pretty girls look like!"
Four girls who had barely passed their teenage years in white gloves, dressed in identical olive-colored jackets and trousers, froze at the guard.
Four pairs of black heeled shoes, aligned to the rule.
Four neat hats perched perfectly on top of hair tied by a blue and white striped knot.
"Personally, I think they look average," Tang said, disdainfully.
"The models are pretty."
More than one government has tried to refresh the image of China's urban inspectors.
One city required all new recruits to have a higher education degree.
Guangdong Province has swapped the gray-green uniforms for a supposedly more engaging blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced the lower-eyes with the strong way:: In 2009, a report reported that 50 officers had surrounded an uncontrollable snack cart by casting black glances, firmly for half an hour, until the peddler packed up his belongings and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 people in Chengdu, chose to do a big image operation.
Since 2003, the district has completed its urban street policing of 13 women, specially chosen for their appearance, body shape and young age.
The idea is to give the skinned police a softer, more feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson might have a hard time drawing attention to China’s underground urban brigade.
And for good reason, critics will say.
Unlike the police, these officers are only allowed to enforce municipal ordinances by imposing fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media portrays the news as a different reality.
In January 2008, inspectors in Hubei province beat an observer to death after he used his mobile phone to film them dispersing a protest against a garbage dump.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors, stolen and posted online, described how to effectively defeat offenders without emitting blood.
This year in Shanghai, a watermelon peddler was abandoned with a brain injury after a fight with five officers.
A video game steeped in violence, available via online download, shows Chinese inspectors trained to assault street vendors.
“Chengguan has marked the government,” China Daily, a national publication, lamented last year after yet another controversy over the tactics.
The newspaper called for a "genuine complete clean-up."
Skeptics say the approach is a long way off.
After the district made an announcement in October to find eight new female recruits, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News questioned whether women had real tasks or were just tourist entertainment.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district’s announcement required female candidates, ages 18 to 22, to have a beautiful figure and “five facial features in the right order.”
They must be above average size, either 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 inches.
Retirement at the age of 26 is mandatory.
Officers said the work was too physically burdensome for women over the age of 25.
“It’s their image that’s important,” a certain district officer told Rednet.com, a quasi-government website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they are suitable; it is the size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then come the temperament and the “inner qualities.”
Chengguan women are like flower vases, he said, adding: “In addition to being vases, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the city's district management office, does not agree with this description.
But he noted that height requirements were the standard in many Chinese job postings for both sexes.
This is the case of the requirement relating to the order of the facial features.
That it means beautiful is a matter of debate among the Chinese.
Of course, disabled or disfigured people should not apply.
“We can’t let a limping person or a hunchback come and serve here,” Zheng said.
“It wouldn’t give a good image.”
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old and has cheekbones with a finely curved mouth.
She doesn’t consider highlighting her appearance as sexist, she said.
“Do you think I look sexy in that uniform?” she asked disillusionedly.
Xu Yang, his dimpled 21-year-old colleague, says: “Our job is to present the image of the city.”
They don’t object to their mandate being limited, they said, because they have bigger career ambitions than just chasing salespeople down the alleys where they’re supposed to limit their activities.
Each morning, the team confronts a dozen traveling merchants who move quickly on foot or by bike, trying to sell as many rolls or bowls of tofu as possible before fleeing.
"Master Wang, you must go."
“We’ve told you several times already!” said Xu as a salesman fled on foot, temporarily abandoning his noodle cart.
Officers describe their duties as monotonous rather than arduous.
“It’s pretty much the same thing every day,” said Huang Jing, 20, who studies after-work marketing.
"Great routine."
One reason is that female agents do not have the power of their male counterparts to confiscate sellers' property.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male superiors.
This tends to protect them from the sudden public exposures of animosity against bureaucracy that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, revolted after false rumors spread that chengguan agents had killed a vendor.
In one night, more than a dozen police and chengguan agents were injured, 14 government vehicles were knocked over or set on fire.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But calm is not guaranteed.
Just two blocks from placid Baoguang Square, where female officers were patrolling that morning, more than 50 people gathered around the corner.
Officers confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a store, as required by regulations.
The owner of the motorcycle was yelling at the scandal.
A 15-minute standoff ensued before the officers, grim-faced, elbowed their way toward their vehicle and sped off with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator attached to the men’s team, stayed behind, his white badge flipped over to hide his name.
Like female officers, coordinators - men aged 40 or over - play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not formed in order to maintain a waxed image.
“Sometimes we fight verbally.”
“Sometimes we fight physically,” Mr. Li said in a neutral tone.
“Most of the time, it’s the audience that starts.”
Prosecutors Won't Charge Senator Ensign
Attorneys for the Department of Justice have dropped criminal charges against Senator John Ensign stemming from a case involving a former campaign aide and his efforts to secure a lobbying job for the woman's husband, the senator's lawyers said Wednesday.
The decision ends the most serious legal threat faced by Mr. Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was considered a possible Republican candidate for the 2012 presidential election until the scandal surrounding his case made national headlines last year and hurt his career.
Mr Ensign's office said he was "very happy" with the decision, the result of a year-long investigation.
The senator could still be exposed to disciplinary action by the Senate Ethics Committee.
Mr. Ensign’s lawyers stated that the Department of Justice had “reported that Senator Ensign was no longer the subject of the investigation and that he did not intend to pursue any charges against him in this matter.”
The Department of Justice declined to comment.
The announcement came as a kind of surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Justice Department, who said there was significant evidence that Mr. Ensign conspired to violate a federal criminal prohibition on lobbying.
Interviews, emails and other documents, first released in October 2009 in the New York Times, indicated that Mr. Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, get a lucrative lobbying job to win the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator’s affair with her.
Mrs. Hampton once served as treasurer during an Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political funders to find work for Mr. Hampton and then defended their rights after they hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them; in accordance with the documents and interviews.
Since Mr. Hampton had recently been an associate of Mr. Ensign, he was prohibited by law from lobbying his former employer or the Senate as a whole for one year.
Ethics experts have argued that the unusual deal between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends before the case, seems at odds with the so-called revolving door lobbying ban.
Based on the evidence that has been made public, “there appears to be prima facie evidence of a conspiracy to violate and substantial violation of the revolving door law,” said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients from an investigation by the government.
Although the department's judge declined to explain the reasoning that led to the decision in Ensign, Brand and other ethics lawyers said the department appeared to be wary of political prosecutions after a number of high-profile setbacks suffered by its public integrity section, including last year's decision to drop prosecutions against former Senator Ted Stevens.
Federal prosecutors are clearly afraid to take up arms, said Melanie Sloan, the executive director of Citizens for Accountability and Ethics in Washington, an advocacy group that has received several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
"This basically says high-ranking government officials can now assume the laws don't apply to them", she added.
Paul Coggins, Mr. Ensign’s senior lawyer, said in an interview that he received a phone call on Monday from a Justice Department prosecutor and a follow-up the next day, telling him that the department was not seeking charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign’s legal team had cooperated with prosecutors to try to persuade them that the senator, as his office reaffirmed Wednesday in a statement, “acted in accordance with the law.”
Mr. Coggins declined to elaborate on the legal arguments he had made to the prosecution.
“I’m not comfortable going into the details of my discussions with the Department of Justice, except to say that we think they made the right decision,” he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to drop an investigation following an independent complaint by the ethics group, arguing that Mr. Ensign’s parents’ $96,000 payment to the Hamptons violated federal election law.
The election commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money was anything but a gift.
NV Energy, a major Nevada company that has long supported the senator, is a company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find lobbying work.
An email sent in December 2008 showed that, after the company welcomed Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensign’s chief of staff, John Lopez, contacted Mr. Hampton and told him that he was “hammering” the Department of the Interior over a disputed issue.
Mr. Ensign also attended a luncheon with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada customer, Allegiant Air, and asked the Secretary of Transportation to set up a meeting on behalf of the airline after engaging Mr. Hampton in lobbying.
When news of the case surfaced last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned as the fourth-ranking Republican leader in the Senate.
After maintaining a low profile for several months, Mr. Ensign said two weeks ago that he intends to run for a third term in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr. Ensign was no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, said the senator hoped that the ethics committee would quickly follow the example of the Department of Justice and end its investigation.
Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada, she said.
Cheshire's call will point to Twitter
Half a dozen of them were typing in the distance in the rows of the courtroom.
They were sending every minute reports of horrible testimonies via Twitter.
In the end, the defense said there were more than 140,000 messages about the trial of the rape case and the children tied to their bed in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, the widely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of the Cheshire family in Connecticut, is expected to lead to an official end where the judge would impose the death penalty, voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already filed elements in court that outline appeal arguments, likely to occupy the courts for years.
What is provocative is that the intense reporting on the trial – as well as the widespread and widespread use by Twitter journalists – has created a “circus atmosphere”, a saturation so widespread and instant with incendiary details that the jury has been badly influenced by the passions of the public.
The application could prompt appellate judges to debate whether new technologies require new rules in courtrooms.
"I experienced this at this trial; I think there is a real danger, the introduction of new technologies in the courtrooms is undermining the human rights to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, a lawyer for Mr. Hayes, Chief Counsel.
The trial judge, Jon C. Bleue of the State Superior Court, bluntly rejected the claims in last week's ruling, saying the media was "carefully controlled" and there was no evidence that the jury was driven by passion.
But that doesn’t seem to be the last word on the issue.
Courts of appeal have recognized for decades that media coverage of notorious cases can raise questions about the fairness of a trial.
In a landmark 1966 judgment, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, arguing in its decision that there was a “carnival atmosphere at the trial” because of the media.
The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for the television show and film "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers said that the appellate courts seized to review Mr. Hayes’ conviction half a century later may be curious given the argument that new rules might be needed to manage the means of communication in courtrooms, unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard’s case.
“There is a general reason to worry about the impact of new media” in large-scale trials, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that it was arbitrarily applied.
Professor Donohue says some appellate judges might be intrigued by the idea that limiting instant communication from courtrooms could allow for fairer trials.
The Twitter case is just one of many described by Mr. Hayes’ lawyers, likely to be discussed for years; which delays enforcement.
Defense lawyers also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes was harmed when Blue J. refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them grisly photos of crime scenes during jury selection.
Some of the jurors said they were horrified by the photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11.
Defense lawyers say they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and argue that the judge unfairly expelled one of the jurors, who had been critical of prosecutors, and improperly pressured a verdict by making the unusual decision to get the jury to deliberate over a weekend.
The jurors weren't sequestered.
But their arguments about the effect of the intense media coverage of the trial could be the biggest source of interest.
They noted in a challenge to the verdict, filed last month, that the case dominated the media scene in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and the U.S. Senate.
They maintained that the computer media kept fanning the flames of emotion about the case.
“The daily jostling of media tweets, cameras and journalists in front of the courthouse,” the lawyers wrote, “resembled nothing that had been seen before here in New Haven, and perhaps even nationally.”
Their focus on Twitter system coverage is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said the claim that instant news was more incendiary than slower-delivered press releases was a luddite view that would impoverish the Court’s policy governing media coverage of future trials.
But some lawyers said appeal courts are often drawn to arguments that social and technological changes require adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayes’ lawyers insist on this claim.
In their case, they made reference to the 1966 Supreme Court decision that overturned Dr. Sheppard’s conviction because of media coverage of the trial and made it clear that they would invoke the need for new rules for new media.
“This case,” they wrote, “represents the 21st century Sheppard v. Maxwell case.”
Can civility bridge the divides?
After a campaign marked by invective and negativity, a modicum of civility erupted in Washington this week.
Is this a harbinger of genuine bipartisan forward cooperation or an illusory moment before the quick return to partisan struggle in the capital?
Tuesday’s meeting between President Obama and congressional leaders produced no breakthrough on the big issues that need to be addressed during the “lame duck” session.
But obviously, there was at least a polite discussion about the differences between the two sides as well as the recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another episode where each side wanted to score points.
Wednesday’s public meeting of the president’s deficit committee was just as civilized, despite the political differences that remain between members.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months has created a mutual respect transcending the ideological gap; but which, however, still divides the members.
This is hardly enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
The two sides are now in a period of testing and testing each other for signs of cooperation and compromise, while trying to gauge the limits of public opinion and voter patience for a renewed partisan war.
That’s why Tuesday’s meeting and subsequent comments from participants unveiled a minimum of requirements or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and Republicans are too big and too deep to suggest a rapid climate change that has existed over the past two years.
Whether it’s taxation, spending, health care or entitlements, the two sides remain miles apart.
Yet the November election had moderated Washington, at least in the short term.
“There’s no doubt that things have changed on the tone,” said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official, now with the Center for Ethical and Public Policy.
“This is inevitable after the election.
Elections arouse partisan passions, and then they fade away.
That's good."
On some issues, including those on the agenda of the lame duck session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush’s tax cuts will expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favor of that.
Both sides want to find a way to preserve some or all of it, permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, a compromise is possible on extending unemployment benefits, if only because Republicans cannot afford to give the impression that they are in favor of tax cuts for the rich, while denying unemployment benefits to unemployed workers.
After Tuesday's meeting at the White House, more optimism is hovering over a possible agreement on the issues raised during the session on the "lame duck", with the ratification of the "New START" pact.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution warns that fruitful cooperation on the most pressing issues of the blade duck session will not necessarily lead to a better understanding between the two parties when the 112th Congress convenes in January.
Instead, he says, a period of disagreement is likely, if not inevitable.
“Once the things that need to be done are done, psychology in the short term will return to one of the confrontations,” he said.
Wehner also expressed his widely shared skepticism that civility would lead to genuine cooperation.
“I consider most of what’s going on between now and 2012 as pre-show or shadow-boxing compared to the main event of 2012, he said.
The reasons for this are closely linked to the composition of the new Republican majority in the House and the voters present at the tea party that contributed to its creation.
However, Republican leaders are aware of the dangers if they go too far, they know they must try to live up to their promises to cut public spending and repeal the new health care law.
These partisan positions are already clear in the first reactions to the recommendations of the deficit committee, which include reforming the tax code and increasing certain taxes, raising the retirement age and reducing spending.
Co-chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have chosen one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and have, in their own words, imposed the deficit issue on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18-member commission to issue their plan as an official recommendation, and they have struggled to reach that number.
The greatest resistance remains among the elected representatives of the group, which suggests that there is little motivation or willingness to compromise on fiscal issues, at least today.
Galston envisions two phases in the fighting between the White House and congressional Republicans.
The first will come next year in the form of partisan clashes, as Republicans challenge Obama on budget, taxes and health care; then it will be followed by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What would be the cause of the change?
The public opinion.
There is ample evidence that, despite the partisan spirit of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want the two parties to work together.
If the confrontation leads to an impasse, as in 1995, then both parties will watch the public reaction carefully.
The one who will be judged in loss will have to change course and find compromises.
However, that would be an optimistic view.
The partisan spirit and polarization is greater today than it was in the mid-1990s, and there seems to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and congressional Republicans than there was then between President Bill Clinton and Republicans.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a more consequential election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civility exposed this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort on both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
US documents released describe Moscow as a haven for corruption
Control of the city is in the hands of a “Kleptocracy” and passes some of the bribes and protection money it collects to the Kremlin, the U.S. Embassy in Russia said in a note in February.
The police and the Federal Security Service are carrying out huge rackets that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow, he said.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses but also from organized criminal groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy – what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the “vertical of power” – takes its share as money moves up the ladder.
The memo, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted Wednesday by WikiLeaks on its website.
The note is based on sources whose names have been redacted.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow; and he is largely held responsible for corruption.
He was fired in October by President Dmitry Medvedev but there have been few signs of clean-up since then.
Luzhkov and his wife, Elena Baturina, who owns a leading construction company, have always denied corruption charges over the years; and he has won several defamation lawsuits over these charges.
In September, he said the following to a Russian TV channel, when asked about a documentary suggesting he was corrupt: “It’s crazy, it’s toss, it’s whatever.”
The Russians believe, by an overwhelming majority, that their society is corrupt; according to the polls.
But it is unusual to find the information stated in an embassy report; and it is unheard of to conceive that it would be to diplomats from a foreign country to do so.
The direct link established between the Moscow city government and crime has led some people to call it “dysfunctional” and claim that the government functions more like a kleptocracy than a government.
Criminal elements enjoy a “krysha” (a term used in the criminal/mafia world that literally means “roof” or protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior (MVD) and the prosecutor’s office, as well as through the entire bureaucracy of the Moscow city government.
"The analysts identify a three-tiered structure in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
“The FSB, MVD and militias are at the second level.”
"Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
“This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a gap in certain areas where the city does not provide certain services.”
The report says the FSB is siphoning off money from the biggest companies and police are targeting the small ones.
A source, he said, “explained that Moscow business owners understood that it was better to get protection from the MVD and the FSB (rather than organized crime groups) because, not only do they have more weapons, more means and more power than criminal groups but they are also protected by law.”
“That’s why the demand for protection from criminal gangs is no longer as high.”
The memo notes that although the collection of money is extensive, the protection itself may be uneven; even those who pay are sometimes subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly see their business closed under one pretext or another.
Medvedev has mentioned the fight against corruption several times but has admitted little progress.
The embassy's memo relays reports of men bringing suitcases, probably filled with money, to the Kremlin.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev depends on bureaucrats," Georgy Satarov, director of Moscow's Indem think tank, said in a recent interview.
“But he’s part of that bureaucracy.”
“He is not part of a political class because there is no political class in Russia.”
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of powers, corruption is inevitable.
According to Indem, the cost of corruption is estimated to be more than $300 billion a year for the whole of Russia.
The country was ranked 154th in a recent survey on the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries are ranked at least as corrupt).
The release of the U.S. Embassy memo, which was made only yesterday, late in the evening, Moscow time, will certainly stir up discontent within the Russian government; although Luzhkov may be blamed, to some extent, for Moscow’s failures, this could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to show that it is solving the problem.
Interviewed by CNN’s Larry King, Putin speculated that the WikiLeaks documents could be a fabrication and reacted angrily to the comments that U.S. diplomats had leaked by calling him Batman and bringing Medvedev closer to Robin.
"The problem lies in the fact that it is our interaction, an important factor in domestic politics in this country," he said.
“But to be honest with you, we didn’t suspect it would be done with such arrogance, such pressure and, you know, in opposition to ethics.”
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to confront the past
In a dimly lit classroom with dilapidated concrete walls of poor quality, the headmaster of Anlong Veng High School referred to the man who had built it, the last leader of the Khmer Rouge, Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
“He was a good leader; and he cared about his people,” said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as "the butcher" for his brutality, when he was at the head of the Khmer Rouge, this commander remains popular in this isolated stronghold of former Khmer Rouge in northwestern Cambodia where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure; and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live today.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, long-standing loyalty is finally called into question to Anlong Veng.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed victims to publicly confront people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed a high-school textbook that, for the first time, teaches the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of its former soldiers.
And, in July, a Cambodian court, jointly run with the United Nations, handed down its first sentence on a former Khmer Rouge member, sentencing to 35 years in prison the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture centre, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as “Duch”.
In the face of this development, anxiety has increased among the Khmer Rouge veterans of Anlong Veng; complicating reconciliation efforts and their willingness to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
“There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge but they are powerless to do anything,” said Chhang Youk, director of the Documentation Centre of Cambodia, an independent body that conducts research on the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"The situation is creating divisions within families."
During the rule of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia from 1975 to 1979, about 1.7 million people were executed or died of starvation, disease or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew Pol Pot’s government in 1979, the rest of the regime and its army fled to Cambodia’s border with Thailand.
There they launched an insurgency that lasted until the last of the movements surrendered in December 1998.
While Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary were leading the guerrillas from their base in the mountains of western Cambodia and in the jungle, Ta Mok was preparing a sequel to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace deal led to the country’s first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began defecting to the government, culminating in the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had stood his ground, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the mountains near Dangrek.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Without their benefactors, most Khmer Rouge veterans have sunk into the black misery common to rural Cambodia; and many remain nostalgic for the movement.
Although a few elite Khmer Rouge officers kept their posts as local leaders in exchange for laying down their arms, these are unskilled farmers of low rank and record.
“These people benefited from very little follow-up after the capitulation,” said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which organizes public forums across Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
“They are soaked in the regime’s agrarian utopian ideology.”
“They were raised in a setting where doing business is a foreign concept.”
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling in 1998 as a poor rice farmer.
“Life under the Khmer Rouge was good,” he said.
"Ta Mok feeds everyone."
But now life is difficult because we have to provide for ourselves.”
The ongoing Khmer Rouge court has also caused concern here.
The court is expected, early next year, to begin the trial of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The court's mandate is to try senior leaders and those most responsible for crimes, but it did not say whether it was pursuing beyond those four cases.
It would take more to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
The latest media speculation has turned to 64-year-old Im Chaem, a former district chief in Banteay Meanchey province under the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Documentation Centre of Cambodia that she had overseen the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project where thousands of forced labourers were reportedly killed.
Recently, on a scorching evening, Im Chaem was returning from field work near his wooden house on stilts, on a dirt road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun cast long shadows on the dried grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss his past within the Khmer Rouge.
If the court summoned her, she said, she would refuse to go.
“Cambodia is at peace and stable,” she said.
“If there are more prosecutions, there will be war.”
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that instability would occur if the court prosecuted multiple suspects; though experts and historians dispute this.
“Cambodia needs to dig a hole and bury the past,” he said.
But confronting the past is all Cambodia needs to do to move forward, says Youk Chhang of the Documentation Centre.
“Reconciliation in Khmer terms is about reconnecting the broken pieces,” he says.
“We have to put these pieces together so we can understand.”
The center produced the first government-approved manual on the Khmer Rouge, “A History of Democratic Kampuchea, Consisting of 75 Pages.”
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the Ministry of Education history textbooks, designed for high schools, which contained less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most of Cambodia, the youth of Anlong Veng know only a few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city’s ties to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new textbook helps students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted with skepticism when he returned home with the book to study.
“My family rejects many parts of the manual and the court,” he says.
“They are wary because they don’t know exactly how many people the court will prosecute.”
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But public forums, the manual and the courtroom are starting to have an impact, he said.
Yet the Khmer Rouge retain a powerful allure here.
In the heights of the Dangrek Mountains, a path, overgrown with weeds and strewn with plastic bags, leads to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a rusty sheet metal roof.
Pol Pot’s body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, a 31-year-old roadside cell phone saleswoman, said she didn’t know much about the man who was cremated there.
"But he has a great spirit; and many inhabitants go there to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea’s birthday and later that day she planned to walk to Pol Pot’s last resting place where she would leave a bouquet of ripe bananas in hopes of bringing good luck.
Belarus agrees to give up its stockpile of military-grade uranium
The government of Belarus announced Wednesday that it will abandon its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, an essential component for nuclear weapons; this decision is part of a surprise victory of President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials around the world.
The agreement was disclosed in a joint statement released after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met here with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov on the sidelines of a security summit.
The U.S. government had been trying for years to convince Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium and seemed to have cleared the horizon last spring.
But U.S. officials told the Washington Post that some classified operations have been conducted with Belarus over the past two months to remove 187 pounds of military-grade uranium from a Belarusian research center.
That paved the way for an agreement Wednesday to eliminate the rest of the matter of about 500 pounds, according to an official who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit, hosted at the initiative of Obama; where Belarus was excluded.
Apparently, it was beneficial to procure an invitation to the former Soviet Republic following the summit in 2012.
“I’m really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit.”
“It proves to me that this process is working,” said Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership for Global Security, a nuclear security advocacy group.
Clinton called the agreement "a very significant, important step" made by Belarus.
Obama pledged in Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials around the world within the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries have done so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At Obama’s Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said the nation would never give up its uranium.
“We kept highly enriched uranium, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially military grade uranium and low enriched uranium,” Lukashenko said.
“This is our product... We’re not going to make dirty bombs, and we’re not going to sell it to anyone.”
“We’re going to use it for research purposes, that’s all.”
Belarus got closer to the United States a few months ago; however, by expressing interest in reaching an agreement.
The first implementation to remove uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the material had been lightly irradiated, officials said.
It was loaded onto a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to a facility in Russia to be stored and disposed of, officials said.
The second operation was completed on Monday and was carried out by plane, officials said.
The U.S. government spent $13 million in its efforts, largely to replace Belarus’s research facilities with low-enriched uranium; unsuitable for weapons.
“Careful coordination and organization has been put in place to build trust,” leading to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, an energy department official specializing in global threat reduction.
According to estimates by the James Martin Nonproliferation Study Center, Belarus this year had at least 88 pounds of military-grade uranium, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus is seeking to eliminate its stockpiles by 2012, according to a joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, mainly due to Lukashenko's harsh crackdown on human rights.
But Wednesday’s statement suggested a potential revival.
“While welcoming progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognized that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remain essential to improving bilateral relations; and indispensable to the progress of the country and its citizens,” she said.
The government raised no objections to the CIA flights.
The government has raised no objections to CIA flights with Taliban and al Qaeda prisoners to Guantanamo Bay through Spanish territory, according to a telegram from the U.S. ambassador in Madrid.
This is demonstrated by the documents filtered (cables) by Wikileaks in the daily El Pa<0xC3><0xAD>s, which add that the first vice-president of the Government of that time, Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Teresa Fernández de la Vega, had requested that the Spanish Executive be informed in order to be able to "demonstrate that they exercised adequate vigilance on the foreign planes that crossed Spain".
In June 2006, after a Council of Europe report accusing a dozen countries, including Spain, of complicity in practices contrary to human rights, a meeting was held between former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council's report "surprised the Zapatero government out of the game" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no objection with regard to the theft of intelligence over Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" to avoid being "taken by surprise," Aguirre said in a cable.
The head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at that time, Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel Moratinos, informed the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give this case the lowest possible profile, even if, as it was in the hands of the judges, the Government had a limited ability to influence".
In turn, in January 2007, the prosecutor Vicente González told the Embassy that he would not block the judge's initiative to request the declassification of the documents of the National Intelligence Center (CNI) and the Ministry of Defense on the CIA flights.
"These reports contain no incriminating elements, no sensitive information," the embassy said after speaking with the prosecutor.
The U.S. has shown concern about "apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and German prosecutors" rather than declassified information from the Defense Ministry's CNI o.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle the case discreetly between governments," Aguirre said.
In March 2007, during a luncheon between the U.S. ambassador and Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, the latter commented that "even if the Spanish judges are madly jealous of its independence and will do what they consider appropriate", he had given instructions to his collaborators "to try to avoid the comments of a heated rhetoric".
The Ambassador also expresses his concern for the PP's action in this case.
“Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience suggests that PP will certainly take advantage of any indication that the Zapatero government has condoned or deliberately ignored actions by the United States that could be interpreted as potential human rights violations, even if those revelations have negative consequences for the United States government,” she said.
The parricide who went to confession complained in a network of the "depression" of being a mother
The girl was talking about the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Terreur <0xC3><0xA0> la galicienne"
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" in the network.
With this nickname that she used from an early age, she communicated with a cousin and at least one friend; both from Noia, the village of A Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a from which she originated.
The messages are from 2008.
To hear them, one must know his sentimental life, which ABC builds with the help of the testimonies of his parents.
The 30-year-old Galician girl had initiated a relationship in 1998 with Iván T<0xC3><0xBA><0xC3><0xB1>ez, an industrialist.
Their relationship lasted a year.
Shortly after they separated, it became known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his own, but his ex never let him take the DNA test.
We discovered another new boyfriend shortly after that.
The elected one was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring municipality.
With him, she lived together for a long time.
Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to survey the labor market, the little boy stayed with his partner, who even accompanied her for a week in Palma.
But according to the content of his communications, it is understood that their idyll has fractured, they have separated.
In March 2008 she was in Menorca, alone, and wrote: "Alberto is very strange and offended by the fact that I came to work there."
“When I told him, it seemed like a good thing, but of course he now realizes what it means to be with the child all day and not have the freedom to do what he wants.”
And then, she talks about a mobile message she had just received: "I want you to come back this month or you give me an address to send you the child."
Ella complains, “If he doesn’t like it, let him leave the kid with my mom, and I’ll take him when I get home,” she alleges.
In May, she talks about returning to her village: "This week I'm leaving, but I'll only stay there until the 19th, because on the 20th I have to show up at a job so I don't lose it."
She explains that if all went well, she would have taken her elder with her.
"He will stay with the right person, that is to say with me, and I will never leave him in my life with another person if that person is not my mother," dubious intention, taking into account their bad relations.
In July, there is another post.
When she slaps him, it is assumed that the child, who had arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, and he had supposedly been murdered on the 10th, died.
“Caesar is happy on one side, but he is not happy on the other.”
"On the one hand he's with me and he likes this place a little bit, but on the other hand he goes to school almost every day."
She's talking about a trip to Majorca.
"He'll be there a few hours in the summer, so I'll save the babysitter some money."
On the 17th, greetings and complaints.
"A very big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you will come."
“Alberto says he sent you I don’t know what videos in the email, you see, whenever he wants it, he finds me, shit.”
On the 30th, another: "The child is fine, he goes during the summer hours to learn Catalan.
On V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor, his current partner, there is one: "He advances me money".
On the Internet she has posts in blogs dedicated to animation and manga.
She had one of her own in the MySpace universe, now locked up, where her name was "Muki the Prison Liberator."
"Terre <0xC3><0xA0> la galicienne (epigraphe)".
The last man who lived with her, vigilante, declares his regret to feel guilty.
He doesn’t want to think that it was all over so that she didn’t tell him the fact that she was a single mother.
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica entered yesterday the provincial penitentiary of Palma, coming from the center of judicial detainees of Menorca.
The ex officio lawyer, Carlos Maceda, explained that she does not remember how the facts happened, "and she also did not intend to harm the minor".
Before she had confessed to drowning Caesar in the bathtub and deposited his corpse in a suitcase.
The defense and the prosecutor requested a psychiatric test.
The members of the People's Party would win 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of the 18-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lleida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the significant increase in votes and deputies registered in the last autonomous elections, the Catalan PP has already targeted the generals because, even if there is progress or not, the prospects are more than positive, because the number of votes that this formation obtains in these elections normally doubles that it receives in the Catalans.
Thus, the popular Catalans obtained 610,473 votes in the general elections of 2008, while in the autonomic elections of 2006, they had obtained 316,222.
Last Sunday, the CPP got 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend, desired by a diversion of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of the electorate of the PP, is maintained, analysts of this formation have calculated the fact that, if there were a general election, the CPP could go from 8 to 12 deputies in Congress, while CiU would also win four (it now has 10) and PSC would lose no more.
These calculations would find that the Catalan place is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to the popular analysis, ERC would lose one MP - he now has three - while ICV would keep one MP or win one.
But if the electoral agenda is maintained, the next meeting would take place in May 2011 for the municipal councils, where the people can also be decisive at the end of the socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in their relay at the head of the General Council of Barcelona, one of the administrations that manipulates the higher budget - 661 million euros for 2011-.
Both the nationalists and the popular ones agree that PSC could lose the town halls of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lleida and Gerona, where the socialists would not get the majority either the possibility of resorting to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Taking into account the Republican debacle, it would not be fanciful that this formation loses its representation in the mayoralty of Barcelona - it is necessary to obtain 5% of the votes.
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lleida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lleida, the PP recorded only a difference of 500 votes compared to PSC, whose mayor, <0xC3><0x80>ngel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they met several times.
The popular have also made progress in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
The PP is now present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in a maximum number of localities.
The Catalan cell facilitated thousands of passports to Al Qaida
Apart from the seven detainees in Barcelona, there were three in Thailand.
The seven Pakistanis and the Nigerien detained by agents of the General Information Commissioner of the Police of Barcelona formed a jihadist cell that, directed from Thailand, facilitated passports to different groups Al Qaida, among which "The Tigers for the Liberation of the Tamil Land" (LTTE) caused the death of 106 people in 2008 and "Laskar e Taiba" (Let), the last of which was the death of "Laskar e Taiba" (Let).
The Ministry of the Interior has given great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that with "Operation Kampai" has "been debilitated" the falsification apparatus of Al Qaeda at the international level and "therefore, its operational capacity".
Investigators calculate that the cell, in the two years it was active in Catalonia, was able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, or they were falsified and then distributed to groups that were part of the Al Qaeda criminal galaxy so that its “combatants” could cross European borders and other Western countries with total impunity.
The dismantled cell is not the only one that the jihadist network was operating in Europe, that is why in the investigations participated, apart from the Thai services, other European police units, that is why in the territory of the European Union there could be in the following days similar blows to that recorded last Tuesday night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the detention of the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade), another was carried out in Thailand, with the capture of the Pakistanis Muhammad Atharland Butt and Ehkan.
They were the ones who led from Bangkok the cell established in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of which was hit in 2009 - mainly stole from tourists passports that met the conditions marked by the so-called "World Islamic Front".
That is, the documents had to be in the name of young men between 25 and 45 years old, with a validity of several years and without stamped visas.
The investigators point out that so far no details have been found that connect the detainees in Catalonia with the attack in Bombay, even though the perpetrator of this attack, "Laskar e Taiba", was one of the groups receiving the passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it must be remembered that a few days before this attack was committed, Catalonia was sent through a transfer agency a few thousand dollars that were "invested" to buy mobile cards that were used later by the members of the "commando" who killed 106 people.
The police have seized a large amount of documentation.
PP asks Mas to suspend tax complicity
The leader of PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose to Artur Mas his conditions to support his investiture as president of the Generalitat, identical to those exposed during the campaign and which boils down to giving priority to the recovery of the economy and the lack of philo-sovereignist adventures as is the economic complicity that the nationalist leader has.
The president of the popular Catalans arrived at the appointment with Artur Mas with the security that gives the fact of having obtained 18 deputies in the elections last Sunday, a number more than enough to be loved, because the candidate of CiU requires that at least one of the formations that will exercise the oppositions abstain in the vote of the inauguration.
A possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances that the nationalists want to maintain in the Congress during the general elections, but, for the moment, the conversations that Mas has these days with the rest of the political leaders are in the Catalan key.
And as for the president of the PP, to support an investiture "it would be necessary to eliminate all the sovereignist and independenceist speeches", and the economic complicity - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the convergent leader wishes to submit even to the referendum.
The two leaders have in common their bet to lose the political apparatus of a very exaggerated autonomous administration and the elimination of the tax applied to inheritances and donations.
Details of the negotiations on the investiture of Mas will be handled by PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) – who promised a tough opposition – Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do so with Joan Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
Geriatrics says deaths were not due to 'lack of measures'
The owners of the center of Olot does not eliminate the possibility that their night nurse killed more than 11 elderly people
The leaders of the geriatric La Caritat d'Olot (Girona) yesterday offered a press conference to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal behavior of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who killed at least eleven elderly people for whom he was responsible in the meantime he worked there.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, presented himself accompanied by the lawyer of the center, Joan Ca<0xC3><0xB1>ada and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be to be able to exercise the accusation against the person responsible" for the dead but "the legality and responsibility oblige us to assume the procedural situation of civil officials".
And apart from the social discredit that the entity may suffer for not having detected in time the criminal activities of the night nurse, the great threat to La Caritat now takes the form of an important compensation that the legal representatives of the relatives of the victims already calculate.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that from that day on he did not stop killing.
The judge mentioned in the sentence that he ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former geriatric patients - which he suspected that in many cases no doctor personally explored the deceased but, given the age and pathologies of the patients, the formality took place by telephone.
Caritat, through its director, categorically denied this situation yesterday and mentioned that "the lack of measures cannot have been at any time the cause of what happened".
The lawyer of La Caritat added that "in this case there is only a hint of imprudence on the part of any other person than the accused".
The person already baptized as the "Angel of Death" confessed to 11 murders the day before yesterday and detailed that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and a month and a half later he killed a second grandmother.
In this case he caused his death by injecting him with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime he had committed with a mix of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat mentioned the fact that it is complicated to control the access of the staff of the center to medicines.
Insulin injections and the cocktail of sedatives had been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in his desire to relieve the suffering of the inmates, used to kill them.
But laboratory tests will clarify if Vila does not lie by saying that he sought for his first victims a less cruel death or on the contrary he burned them inside by giving them laundry as he has already confessed that he did with the three women he killed in the interval 12 - 17 October.
Caritat does not believe the statements of the night nurse, nor the number of murders confessed, they do not eliminate the possibility that the number is greater and justify their attitude by the different versions that Vila gave in his visits to the Court of First Instance and the lack of logic in changing the way of killing after having successfully committed eight murders.
That is why they declare that they will remain at the disposal of justice to clarify the scope of the facts.
The ECB Threat
Investors reacted abruptly yesterday to Trichet's threat that "markets should not underestimate our ability to react".
Peripheral differentials have come to a head and European banks’ shares have suffered more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we must not underestimate either the ECB's ability to make a mistake and the euro has barely registered an increment, which is a worrying signal.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market that in the same way that it collapses, it recovers, but motivated by closing short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor will be slow to lose fear.
A month ago, ECB summoned us today to withdraw liquidity measures and it will have to retract tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and those that remain.
Bundesbank demanded the completion of the public debt purchase plan because of its ineffectiveness and the elimination of all extraordinary liquidity-providing measures and leaving only unlimited access to the week.
After the Irish crisis, we hope to extend the current liquidity measures "at least until March" and keep the quarterly auction with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We hope that we will continue with the bond-buying program and even give the signal to intensify it.
If they do not meet the expectations generated, they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they continue blinded to withdraw the liquidity measures, God help us!
Just as during their May meeting in which they claimed they hadn’t even considered buying bonds and they collapsed the markets, history could repeat itself tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka Monday and Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse in the market.
Yesterday the one-year milk auction in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury issued only 500 million at 5.28% compared to 750 million at 4.81% of the previous auction.
Even so, the guys in Portugal dropped 30 basis points across the curve, and clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment after Trichet’s words.
In Ireland the figures for the Allied and Bank of Ireland hole have been published.
The estimated figures represent 10,000 million in the short term and 15,000 potential and they have a deadline until February to obtain private capital or they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after failing to detect the problem in July with the stress test, the figures are assumable in the Assistance Plan and help to reduce uncertainty.
Nevertheless, next Tuesday, the Government will have to obtain parliamentary approval of its new budget and it does not yet have sufficient support, therefore Ireland remains in a hotbed of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel moderated the tone of her speech to ease the tension before the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on December 14, in which it is necessary to find a political compromise that demonstrates that we are a union and that we all interpret the same partition.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the rest the anthem of joy of Beethoven.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity yesterday to present the plan of measures that the Council of Ministers will approve on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment ring like the four seasons of Vivaldi.
The double Trichet and ZP effect explains the fact that the Spanish Stock Exchange suffered 4.5%, double that of the rest of the European Stock Exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been rapid and radical and we are enjoying the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect, therefore we hope that this will resolve with strong demand and help dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain to ask for an Assistance Plan would be self-immolation.
They would give us a line of liquidity that we don't need, the Treasury has more than 40,000 million in available liquidity, three times as much as in March, at very expensive rates and they cut off access to the markets sine die.
Nevertheless, the strategy must continue to be that of Caesar's wife, "apart from being, appearing".
Courage, we can get out of this!
The president of Eulen will challenge the advice of Vega Sicilia requested by his sons
The storm does not stop in the open conflict within the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, founder of the group, will contest, because he considers it "null of right", the judicial council of El Enebro next 16, solicited by five of his seven sons in which they will try to assert their majority and seize the management bodies of the titular firm of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez and his sons Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s David and Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a José grant their legal battery for the new chapter of their dispute for control of a part of the group.
The founder of the largest business services holding company for companies does not seem to be willing to give in in his dispute to be present in the management bodies of El Enebro.
He was excluded from his board of directors by five of his seven sons who appointed themselves directors at the January 18th shareholders' meeting this year, the dispute of which is registered in the Trade and Companies Register.
The judicial council of El Enebro for the next 16, summoned by the Commercial Magistrate Number 2 of Madrid, has opened again the box of thunders within the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family.
The recourse to the judge to fix the meeting is, until the conflict is resolved, the only mechanism that guarantees the convocation of the meeting.
The latest move by Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira <0xC3><0x81>lvarez Mezquiriz is described by David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez as a "desperate appeal by the plaintiffs his five sons to try, through procedural cleverness, by clearly defrauding the law and abusing the right, to validate and correct the assembly radically null on January 18," according to his spokespersons.
This argumentation will be the basis for, once the assembly takes place, to be challenged considering that it is "absolutely null and void".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already tried unsuccessfully for the magistrate to convene a meeting in June.
In El Enebro, a patrimonial company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, the sons of David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the service group nevertheless solicits the usufruct on 51% of the capital, according to familiar protocols.
This case is the substantive issue to be decided by the judge after the hearing on the application for challenge for which there is not yet a reported date.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with secret weapon from Siemens
Software creates improvements on cars in real time.
As soon as Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this select world of speed was marked by surprise and success.
At first, no one took into account the options of a new team that had just arrived, despite the upward trajectory of the last seasons, last November, in the last phase of the championship they all bet on the triumph of Ferrari Fernando Alonso.
Without diminishing the skill as a driver of the champion, the German Sebastien Vette, nor the ability of the Renault engine that propels his car, in the world of Formula 1 we speak of the legend of the "secret weapon" that the multinational company Siemens has put in the hands of Red Bull to turn it into a winning team.
It is actually a powerful process simulation software that the German company launched on the market in 2007 with objectives very far from the high automotive competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computer instrument has been used to create assembly lines of manufacturing plants around the world, power stations, high-precision instruments.
The goal is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding defects and avoidable costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan’s most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the industrial division at Siemens, explains that the use of this computer instrument in its Formula 1 plant has allowed Red Bull to create and execute "in a few hours, almost in real time", the modifications, changes and improvements detected during races and tests.
Russwurm explains that the 1992 teams had an average of 10 technicians in their teams who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements to the vehicles each season.
The Red Bull team now employs 180 highly qualified young professionals who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyse and project all kinds of modifications on the cars.
The head of Siemens explained that the PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all the elements of the Red Bull cars except the engine, which is the sole responsibility of Renault.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
The changes can go from simulator virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
As the only limitation of this technological development craze is the $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend as a limit each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has set up the high-tech plant to create and produce its racing cars in a town 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings where visits, especially for journalists, are restricted.
Everything that happens there is considered top secret.
The staff for this task has 580 people, including two pilots, the champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
Red Bull’s Formula 1 hero, no doubt, is the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the energy drink brand has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other hidden protagonists, whose activity is invaluable and the notoriety zero.
The plant’s chief technology officer, Steve Nevey, says five years ago it could be argued that R&D progress in the case of race cars accounted for 50% of the wins and the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and technology represents 85% of the success, while pilots bring 15% of the added value.
Nevey admits that the Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computers, because "they are unpredictable gladiators".
HP to install 20 clean stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) has opened its first exclusive store in Barcelona in collaboration with its partner Pont Reyes.
It will be the first of a network of 20 shops between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational plans to set up in Spain over the next two years.
The company will account for this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multibrand centers such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice-president of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, gave as an example the remodeled store located on the Gran V<0xC3><0xAD>a in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with which she has been collaborating for 30 years.
The North American group has prepared a plan to implement 200 branded points of sale in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes all 20 Spanish establishments.
The first ones opened were those in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, the one in Barcelona being the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible stores, even though she confessed that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HM personal systems assured that the philosophy for the establishment of the stores will always be the same, with the support of a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and deals with the design of the exclusive furniture of the stores (with products that can be touched in an interactive way), which in Europe will hold an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of facility personnel.
Helena Herrero denied that it is a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of businesses claims to "improve the service offered to customers and SMEs in buying, assistance, after-sales and even packaging".
The Barcelona store includes a space with a world-leading pilot program that solves potential problems with HP IT equipment under warranty.
An online service connects with a technical center located in Maastricht (Holland).
“So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can often take even two days.”
"This system is designed especially for MPEs and users, because the large companies have already contracted technical assistance services," said Helena Herrero yesterday.
Sabadell bets on 'stealing' one million customers from rivals in three years
More optimistic than other executives, the managing director of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, thinks that 2011 will be a hard year for the banking sector, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the liabilities war.
In spite of this, it provides for a collapse of the interest margins, which will be tried to compensate partially with increments of commissions and the price of credit.
Sabadell expects to capture in three years a million private customers, its task to be accomplished.
Sabadell has found a way to operate for the next three years and thus be able to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will launch a new master plan in 2011 with a three-year maturity.
The objective, apart from surviving without the need to resort to FROB's public subsidies, is to gain market share by attracting one million new private customers - 700,000 if we deduct those who can leave the bank - its great task to be accomplished, because until now this bank had spoiled more SMEs and companies than the private customer.
This year it has attracted 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share for individuals is 3.5%, while for companies it exceeds 10%.
Another basis of the 2011-2013 plan is the bet on productivity, or what is the same thing, austerity, with the reduction of costs as a goal, the provocations of which will be explained by the bank when it presents the results of the exercise.
Few banks now dare to set targets and make them public, because the financial crisis has upset all the plans of the global banking sector.
Sabadell, in fact, will finalize this year its Optima master plan, established four years ago, even if initially the plan was for three years, but the market situation has determined its extension for one more year.
Clients who let the savings banks slip away will be its main focus.
During a breakfast organized by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a "difficult and transcendental" year.
The executive, in fact, thinks that the exit from the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs", which is fundamental for the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And even though he thinks the war on liabilities — which penalizes margins — is shrinking, the price of risk premiums that banks and credit unions pay for its issuances to get liquidity are already moving at the price of credit to offset the fall in margins.
“The liquidity and financing aspect is structural and will be a credit pressure factor.”
“We didn’t squeeze the tap, but the differentials are higher,” Guardiola said.
Banesto has already given orders to his network to limit long-term credit and increase the price of differentials - see CincoD<0xC3><0xAD>as of 22 and 27 November-.
He also confessed that the tendency of the banking sector now "is to increase commissions", but "there is a competitive framework".
Sabadell’s master plan is based on organic growth even if, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of carrying out corporate operations.
It is not in vain that he assures that in Spain "we will ask for greater dimensions."
“Everything will move next year,” he said.
He claims that capital requirements are “increasing enormously” and some Spanish financial entity could enter the red numbers.
And he mentions that the FROB can replace the market in raising funds in the case of new recapitalizations.
After assuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary close of the markets, he downplayed the importance of the fact that some banks are already predicting as a new liquidity crisis.
He points out that we cannot issue, but unlike what happened in June, we can get short-term funding through rest, which alleviates the crisis.
ECSC rejects the possibility of a second wave of mergers between credit unions
The Director-General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility of a new wave of mergers of savings banks and insisted again on the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is being carried out.
When the process of concentration of the Spanish savings banks began, there were several entities that assured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they were reserved for the second phase.
Nevertheless, the director general of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of the production of this new wave of operations.
"I think that most of the mergers have been carried out, we can not say that the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca C<0xC3><0xAD>vica group is a second phase, these are adjustments."
"Most of it has been completed; it is possible that instead of 17 we go to 13 or 14, but all the major processes have already been carried out under the tutelage of the Bank of Spain, which has collaborated a lot in this operation too," stressed the leader.
In statements during a breakfast of the Association of Directors and Executives of Arag<0xC3><0xB3>n (ADEA), Olavarrieta explained that the process of concentration is being carried out "at the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied with the way in which it is carried out within the deadlines that have been set in the past, not now, in the business plans with the Bank of Spain", emphat.
“The move from 45 caisses with an average asset volume of 28.500 million to 17 with 75.500 million is an unparalleled process in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% so that they are much larger to be compliant with Basel,” he stressed.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there is a series of rather unhappy opinions on the slowness of the process" which demonstrate "a lack of seriousness and meaning", because "what the Bank of Spain is doing is reminding us that we must respect the deadline before the end of the year".
The director general of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in all of Europe and "probably" in the world and he attributed a "lack of knowledge" to people who doubt it.
The leader mentioned that given the current economic situation, "we can remain very calm" with the situation of financial entities and savings banks, a system that has begun a process of concentration "very important" and "goes at the fastest possible speed".
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector has fared well from the stress tests that ECB carried out in July.
Zapatero and the German Red Line
Berlin opted to stay in the euro, but it set the conditions for the whole of the Union.
Market tensions have prompted a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero announced new adjustment methods, which range from tax cuts for SMEs, regulation of private investment agencies or the abolition of 426 euros of aid to the unemployed without professional contribution to the privatization of 49% of AENA, the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the State Lotteries.
On the other, Vice President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, joins Chancellor Angela Merkel’s criticisms of her responsibility to detach the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
It should be mentioned that Merkel’s position is not a mistake in her communicative policy.
On the contrary, it is another restriction of the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which clashes with that of maintaining the old traditions of most of its partners.
In the face of European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate on the three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, and the south would abandon the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of the Mark, even if now it seems science fiction, with a very favorable current of opinion, almost 50% of the population.
The third, a new conception of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, fiscal stringency, fines for countries that violate them, possible suspensions of payments of one of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and has been defined for a long time, so now there is no room for excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission were stimulating deficits, the German government invented a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of a divergence between what Germany thought should be done (plans of fiscal rigour and fiscal stability) and what its European partners, including France, were doing.
The Central European country’s second coup was when Merkel hardly extended the decision to save Greece.
From that moment it was the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion and the published were against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, towards the end of October, Merkel again expressed a clear position, calling for the reform of the Union treaties to make possible the rescue of a country and at the same time oblige private lenders to bear part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as it precipitated the Irish crisis and the rest.
But his proposal, although a little watered down, was approved and, in the following months, we should witness the reform process of the Union that makes these measures possible from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that she does not think she will cross.
And it tells us all that, even if now we have to take measures with which we may not be too much in agreement, from that date on the old functioning of the euro would have ended.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary zone, in which countries that break the rules will be severely punished, they may be forced to declare themselves in default and, in this case, the private sector will also bear part of the costs.
Germany signals to us that we must follow a severe path of growth with high savings and investment rates, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
An alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, like the one that presided over Spanish growth in the boom years, will simply not be tolerated.
The stakes are clear.
And it would be bad not to hear it.
It is not just a question of bringing the public deficit back to 3% in 2013.
What we are asked to do is much harder.
And what he absolutely must not do in these circumstances is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will allow greater tranquility to come to us.
And that we know how to seize the opportunity we were given, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero also heard it in this form and his double statement (the reforms promised after the meeting of the past Saturday with the big companies and the announcement of new measures yesterday) suggests that, despite Merkel's criticisms, the way has been opened to the thesis that we must put order at home.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and they don’t seem to move it.
And among the possibilities that are envisaged, one cannot exclude that of abandoning a monetary zone too crowded with unserious countries.
And in that case, Germany will always be able to tell us that she warned us about it.
Sport and the Fraud of the Law
The tricks similar to those of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax demonstrate ingenuity but not the will to escape a sanction.
The expulsion of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the November 23 match against Ajax in the Champions League has cast a lot of ink on the unsportsmanlike character of such behavior and whether both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is known, a few minutes before finishing the match (which their team was already clearly winning), both players deliberately lost time when they made mistakes to determine the referee to show them the second yellow card.
Thus, and since Real Madrid will eventually be the leader of its group, both players will complete the regulatory sanction during the next game of the play-off match against Auxerre and will be able to pass without cards to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA disciplinary committee sanctioned the team's coach, José Mourinho, with two matches and various economic sums to the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, if not rather common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, the unwritten rules, but followed, of this sport.
Part of the debate that emerged in the case is due to the fact that this had as protagonist a team of the Real Madrid entity (which in its anthem displays nobility and honor and which on past occasions has condemned to a fine to its players for similar acts) and to the provocative dramatization orchestrated, it seems, by Mourinho, which adds one more episode to his story.
In any case, the debate asks whether this type of behaviour is not expressly prohibited by the regulation contradicts the principles of sport, that is, whether with these actions a fraud of law is committed; because, indeed, they are actions respectful with the sports regulation, but seem to elude its meaning.
The question is to examine the type of damage they cause to the sportsmanship.
One of the assets that includes sportsmanship is the physical integrity of the opposing players, an aspect that with these actions has not been put at risk, that is, there has been no violent play.
Another of these assets that is alluded to with correct play is to prevent the team of offending players from unfairly taking advantage of the opposing team, which is not the case either.
However, the paradoxical fact of the action of the Real Madrid players is that it does not accommodate what is normally characterized as cheating or fraud of the law, because its violation of the rules was not carried out secretly to try to avoid the sanction, but their action precisely tried to be as obvious as possible to receive the penalty of the referee.
They were waiting and they gladly accepted the sanction.
Another issue is the type of advantage that offenders obtain from the intentional misconduct examined.
Here it seems necessary to note that one does not put in a situation of disadvantage to the rival and one does not get an advantage in the same match either, because obviously the result of the action supposes the fact of leaving their own team with fewer players.
And this is not a useful strategy for the next game either, because the club could not rely on these players.
Obviously the advantage lies in the fact that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future match.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indeterminacy, because the team could be eliminated suddenly and apart from that, with this action the players complete a penalty game and move on to the second cycle of cards, in which the suspension due to the accumulation of cards occurs with one less than in the first cycle.
So, moving up the ladder, it's not so clear that this is an advantage.
Ultimately, these actions are not contrary to the spirit of sportsmanship, which is still part of making strategic decisions that promote maximum profit from what the rules allow.
In our case, the players did not act to avoid the application of the sanction (this would indeed be a clear case of fraud of the law), but otherwise they chose rather the moment in which they submitted to it.
They made a strategic decision without circumventing the penalty or running away from it.
Even though the line between engineering and the fraud of the law is blurred, on this occasion I think we had a clear case of engineering.
The controversy, it seems to me, arises because of two factors: because there have been two self-expulsions and because of the way of transmitting the director to provoke them.
The harm caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not so much ethical as aesthetic.
Offensive offers to capture Christmas dinners for groups in BCN
The dictatorship of the calendar concentrates this year an avalanche of reservations for the days 16 and 17.
There is a proliferation of self-financed celebrations by employees who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
As the touron and the lottery, when December arrives also return the dinner of groups before Christmas that continue to be the oxygen balloon for the restaurants and entertainment of Barcelona, but that because of the crisis have resulted in an offensive te prices adjusted to be able to capture the majority customer: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros in dinners or meals, coincide the men's associations
To complete complicating the accounting, this year's calendar (as New Year's Eve falls Friday) concentrated requests in the week of December 13, resulting so far in an avalanche of dinner reservations for the peak days (the 17th and 17th) and almost nothing the week before.
Since 2008, which is the origin of difficult times, there are many companies that have eliminated group dinners for budgetary reasons.
To maintain the tradition, many employees organize them by paying from their own pockets.
Whatever the situation, they all ask for battle prices, confirms the president of Gremi de Restauraci<0xC3><0xB3> de Barcelona, Gaiet<0xC3><0xA0> Farr<0xC3><0xA0>s.
The representative of the employer, now, does not dare to predict how the holidays will be this month.
"People think a lot before booking."
“They want to go out but they pay a lot of attention to prices,” he says.
The deal will go well "for those who give quality at a good price and with good service," he adds, and recalls that customers tend to go down a notch with the crisis, so the slice around 25 euros has become the majority in demand.
In a survey in various institutions of the center we note the collapse of requests for the night of the 17th.
The Soteras group indicates that there is an authentic boom of requests for this Friday, with the pretension of spending less than 30 euros, to which they have responded by adapting their menus to the conjuncture, with complete formulas from 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another group of the most powerful, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the particularity of the calendar assumed more advance reservations, even from the beginning of November.
“We did the impossible to maintain the same prices of last year, with menus for all tastes from 19.95 to 30 euros,” they detail.
AN Grup, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 premises, remains optimistic after detecting a boom in billing since the second half and good, although concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources from the group mention that the 18th will also be a hyper-active day at the level of groups of friends who celebrate the holidays in advance.
To their six group menus they added one for Christmas, with 30 euros or more as the famous budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend 10% more than last year instead of requiring more details, like the Catalan wine made according to the Champagne method - 'cava'.
They also see the first signs of improvement in some companies re-invite their employees and the feeling that the volume of groups has increased a bit.
On behalf of the Fecasarm board of directors (which includes entities such as the Bars, Restaurants and Entertainment Association of Barcelona), its vice-president, Enric Gom<0xC3><0xA0>, trusts in the possibility of starting to see the end of the tunnel and argues that overall reservations are "animated", even if customers "negotiate as much as possible".
This is true, the hope regarding the festivities has not declined, regardless of who pays, he says.
Pakistan's nuclear program causes great concern in the United States
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at a faster rate than any other country.
The WikiLeaks leaks confirm the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. Department of State filtered through the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns caused in Washington by the Pakistani nuclear program.
Apart from the enlightening and tasty details they offer about the content of conversations and thoughts of US diplomatic representatives accredited to Islamabad, the documents reveal the fact that cooperation between the two countries in the field of atomic security, instead of increasing, is “decreased” and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons “at a faster rate than any other country in the world.”
The peculiarity of Pakistan’s nuclear program – the fact that weapons are not assembled, but are stored by components to make them difficult to destroy in the event of an attack – is one of the main reasons for concern in Washington.
This is how the ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, lists in a report before the visit of the former National Security Advisor, James Jones: "The proximity of certain nuclear facilities of the territory under attack Taliban, the dispersion of nuclear materials whose noise runs and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials".
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programs is viewed, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as proliferating and a reason to keep guard.
"Pakistan has had to hire personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the decline in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work in nuclear or missile programs," Russian Foreign Ministry expert Yuri Korolev said during a meeting with his U.S. counterparts.
The new documentation filtered through Julian Assange’s portal is the increasingly reduced cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and Pakistan’s high degree of nuclear weapons production.
A dispatch from the embassy in May, which described communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", said: "Transparency is frequently non-existent; offers of aid remain unanswered or are eliminated."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, National Intelligence Officer for South Asia, notes that "despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world."
Ambassador Patterson also asked Washington, during a visit by the head of the Army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to make it "very clear" to the official that "the Army of Pakistan must end tacit support for terrorist groups".
The Hunt for the Wikileaks Leader
Obama will count on a senior counterterrorism official to prevent further infiltration.
Interpol issues a red alert to track movements and locate Assange.
Everything about Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to be certain about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a “red alert” to “locate and track the movements” of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
This one is not new, otherwise it is dated November 20th.
And this one has nothing to do with the latest leak of more than a quarter million diplomatic documents from the United States but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
WikiLeaks founder Mark Stephens said: “The police know where and how to contact Mr Assange.
The 20th the international police force based in Lyon (France) dictated the order at the request of Sweden, but it did not make it public until yesterday, after receiving the authorization of the authorities of that country.
Thus, all 188 Interpol countries were instructed to identify or locate Assange "to obtain his provisional arrest and extradition".
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, according to the organization's explanations, consider the red notice appeal a free way for the arrest -- which the national police force must carry out -- especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case in Sweden and England.
The move outraged Assange’s lawyers, who yesterday published a letter denouncing the fact that the 39-year-old WikiLeaks founder was willing to answer questions from Swedish authorities via video conference.
They also recall that Assange sought and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which is compared to the famous Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin's head of security.
“This appears to be a hunt, not a legal persecution,” the letter said.
While the world searches for him – and in Australia his mother defends the innocence of her son – Assange continues to find himself in an unknown place, but he does not remain silent.
On Monday, he gave an indeterminate interview to the editor of Time magazine via Skype, a conversation in which he called for the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
“If it can be shown that she was responsible for giving orders to American graduates that they spy at the UN in violation of international treaties that the United States has signed, she should resign,” he said.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the resignation request “ridiculous and absurd.”
“I’m not at all sure why the opinion of a guy with a web page should interest us,” he told CNN.
Obama himself has instructed a senior counterterrorism official, Russell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama’s attempt to downplay Assange stands in contrast to the views that conservative politicians and commentators are proclaiming these days.
Peter King, the congressman who will chair the National Security Committee in the lower house from January, has asked the State Department to consider including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to confiscate its funds and prosecute anyone who provides them with contributions or assistance."
Still further along was Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, who had to reconsider his statements after saying that Assange would have to be "assassinated".
“Obama should turn it into a target and use an unmanned aircraft or something like that.”
One person who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and a possible presidential candidate.
“Anyone in the government who leaked the information is guilty of treason and anything other than an execution would be too amiable a punishment,” he told Fox.
Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s seeks peace in the ERC with winks to the followers of Carod
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposed a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s seems to have found the recipe to solve the umpteenth internal revolt inside the ERC, without north because of the loss of 11 deputies and half of the votes.
The president of the party is aware that his threat of resignation is not enough for the followers of the former leader Josep Llu<0xC3><0xAD>s Carod-Rovira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now as diluted as his liar and that this absolutely can not give him headaches that he had with other extinguished currents.
That is why the leader of Esquerra will try to win his new critics with winks that allow him to shield himself until the municipal elections.
For starters, Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s announced yesterday that more than 200 national ERC advisors will be able to rule on its continuity in secret.
By ballot papers, not by raising your hand.
If the carodists want to convey a certain vote of penalization to the president, they can do so without any fear of reprisals.
In fact, the leader of the ranks wants to avoid the image of division and submission to his person.
In several interviews he claimed that he would not consider himself ratified with half plus one of the votes, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, that a "Bulgarian-style" result would not be good either.
Those close to Carod demand from the president a little more than making his position available to militancy, a gesture that is not worth when Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s controls the maximum organ between congresses.
But because they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will try to agree with the executive a roadmap until May.
For this, they hope to participate in the development of the strategic reorientation document that the management will submit to the vote of the national council on the 18th.
Its intention is to support Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s in exchange for his promise to schedule the congress for the fall of 2011, which the leaders consider a sure fact.
The ERC leader confessed that "polyphony" affects stability and that his goal is to make the organization once and for all be able to wash its laundry room as a family.
In this line, the article that the current advisor Josep Huguet signed in his blog is symptomatic.
Considered the ideologue of Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s, the holder of Innovaci<0xC3><0xB3> thought that the fact that the leader will be ratified "in exchange for various objectives" it is as if it had been done.
And he listed five of them, of which he points out two.
The first, to "recompose" the executive so that it represents at least 90% of the militancy, that is, to include new figures who come from the adept sector of Carod.
The second may be the character of great news.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquid once and for all the assembly as an operating mechanism.
Thus, he defends a reform of the statutes that allows the realization of congresses through delegates elected by suffrage.
Ending with the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, was an obsession of the Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s team, which has already struggled in this direction in the last two congresses.
In fact, the convulsive conclave of 2008 instructed management to revise the assembly model in a specific congress to reform the statutes.
This meeting remains unfinished, as the internal tide of recent years did not recommend addressing this topic.
Now, without critical sectors on the lookout, the time might be right to take it back and close it forever.
23 executed in November; 290 in 2010
According to the MILENIO of the State of Mexico, there was a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
In November, 23 people were executed in the state of Mexico, four fewer than the previous month, according to MILENIO of the state of Mexico.
Among the murders are those of three women and the discovery of two bodies cut in Valle de México.
During the penultimate month of the year there were 390 deaths in theory related to organized crime.
Among the cases is that of a corpse found in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, municipality of Toluca.
The subject had at least three gunshots and the coup de grace to the head, apart from the feet and hands tied with a cable.
The next day, the body of a subject was found in a suitcase inside the trunk of an abandoned vehicle on Mixtecas Street in Colonia Santa Cruz Acatlán, Naucalpan municipality.
Very early on Thursday morning, the four, the owners of jointly exploited land found a body with signs of torture and at least three lethal shots in the chest, on the highway near Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal, in the area that crosses the municipality Villa Guerrero.
Near the body was found a message signed in theory by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
A day later in Nezahualc<0xC3><0xB3>yotl a 50-year-old man was murdered with eight shots as he was leaving his house to start the garbage collection work.
On November 7, two 30-year-olds were killed by a gunshot to the head each in the San Pedro Xaloxtoc settlement, municipality of Ecatepec.
In Chalco, a man's body was found shot in the forehead on a lonely path in Colonia El Naranjo, and under the body was found a bullet with a 25-caliber firearm.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the blackwater channel of the Plaza Golondrina settlement.
The emergency services carried out a thorough search of the rest of the body members, but they were not found.
Residents of Tepotzotlán alerted to the discovery of a body that was in Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Colorada, hands tied behind and eyes blindfolded.
The man had a gunshot wound to the back of his neck.
In the middle of the month the execution of two men who had been wrapped in blankets and abandoned in the trunk of a vehicle was reported in the streets of the Villas de la Hacienda department in the municipality of Atizapán de Zaragoza, two death warning messages were discovered at the same time with the victims.
A day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes settlement in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby colony, the rest of the body was found wrapped in a black plastic bag with a message signed by The Incorrigible.
On the 17th, wrapped in blankets, two women were found in the Zoquiapan hamlet of the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the following morning the body of a Huixquilucan man who had been wrapped in a yellow and blue blanket was located, being in principle identified with the name Mario R<0xC3><0xAD>os, according to a message that his executors had left next to him.
In Ixtapaluca, with gunshots to the back of the neck, the lifeless body of a woman was found in the hamlet of San Francisco Acuautla.
On the skin of the woman were detected tattoos of Santa Muerte and necklaces with his image.
Towards the end of the month, the body of a man was found on the edge of a car in the municipality of Zinacantepec with at least three bullet wounds and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of two men with a bandaged head and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies was a message signed in principle by a criminal organization, which said, “This is what happens with those who don’t align.”
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and with hands and feet tied, two bodies were found inside an abandoned taxi behind the San Agust<0xC3><0xAD>n Colony Justice Center.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualc<0xC3><0xB3>yotl.
The first of them had been beheaded in the Cuchilla Anc<0xC3><0xB3>n colony and had been wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with a cinnamon ribbon and a message next to it; while the second had been tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Near him, officers found a Bristol with a message.
China Maintains Targets to Reduce Greenhouse Gases
The representative of this country at COP16 assured that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the trace of coal and detailed that it maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by between 40 and 45 percent until 2020.
China is maintaining its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, said Su Wei, the country’s representative at COP16.
In her first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei assured that her country has made tremendous efforts to reduce the trace of coal and reconvert its industry.
In fact, he said, over the past four years his country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Nevertheless, he made it clear that China will not change its goals, but will continue to work together with the international community in this area.
He mentioned that China's climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity building; institution building; and support for pilot programs.
Progress has been made in all of these areas, including last year's approval of a new Energy Act, which recognizes the targets for reducing greenhouse gases, he said.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, federal authorities have worked in a coordinated manner with government and local governments to achieve the goals of energy saving, efficient energy use and emission reduction.
In addition, he said, there are various multi-year plans underway or completed, both funded by the Chinese government and by the governments of other countries.
For example, he mentioned the Energy Efficiency Programme, which has been implemented for the past five years and has received investment from the United Nations (UN), the government and the private sector.
There is also a provincial climate change project, another for the change of incandescent lamps by energy-saving lamps and another for mitigation and adaptation, he detailed.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the country's government's science adviser on climate change, said China's efforts have been greater than previously thought.
For example, he said, per capita greenhouse gas emissions in China are three tons per person, while in the United States they are 100 tons; China is responsible for 9% of the historical contribution in contamination.
Likewise, it has made unprecedented efforts in the use of energy, how to increase energy efficiency by 20% in the last five years and plans to do another similar one around 2020, he said.
Legal Expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The national leader of PAN detailed that the former Panist leader has the right to address the Commission of National Order to claim what of right.
The national leader of PAN, César Nava Vázquez assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was legal and that the former Panist leader has the right to address the Commission of National Order to claim what is right.
In the interview prior to Gabino Cue Monteagudo's taking protest as state governor, he said that in any case, the expulsion of Espino is a decision adopted at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sonora Order Commission."
"Mr. Espino has the right to address, if necessary, by making a claim to the Order Commission of the National Council, so that this is a decision taken within a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he clarified that this is not the time to think about 2012 and there has never been an alliance on the negotiating table for the presidential candidacy.
Nava Vázquez said he was convinced that Acci<0xC3><0xB3>n Nacional would be stronger after the internal elections on December 4 and 5, where a successor should be elected.
“This (an alliance in 2012) is an aspect that has never been on the negotiating table, at least for the moment, it has been an approach for local elections that has been successful and achieved its goal,” he said.
The Panist leader mentioned that PAN is supported by 71 years of dialogue, which is why "internal competition does not scare us; on the contrary "we savor it and make us stronger," he said.
He said the board will no doubt elect the best leader Acci<0xC3><0xB3>n Nacional needs for the next three years, so he would give the reins "to the person determined by the board."
"I am completely calm and open, and I would be proud to leave the office of party president to any of the five."
He predicted that the party's pick-up in the July 4 elections would be reflected on the next dispute, even if "it is not yet time to think about 2012."
"For the moment it is a question of accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that emanate from the alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observation throughout the country, so that there has been "a lot of hope as far as they are concerned, and I am sure that Gabino will be up to expectations".
When asked about PRI’s criticism of President Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n because of his speech during his four years in office, César Nava asked PRI members to reflect on the six years of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
“If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo y Salinas have been better than those of Fox y Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n; let them start defending them; let them come out of the closet,” he said.
He said that the head of the Federal Executive can make expressions like those he made in his speech in the National Auditorium, because in the country there is no gag, and even less censorship.
Obama tweets support for undocumented students
“If you agree with the passage of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to approve this legislation,” the president tweeted.
President Barack Obama met today at the national mobilization in support of the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message in his personal account of the social network Twitter.
“If you agree with the passage of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to approve this legislation,” Obama tweeted.
His short message keeps open a cybernetic link to a larger document that asks the public to contact senators immediately, because the vote on the legislation is imminent.
"With a vote that we hope to have soon, now is the time to listen to your voice," he said.
The message was leaked after 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote on any legislation if the extension of Bush-era tax cuts and government funding drags on.
Such a freeze, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the passage of the Dream Act and other bills such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the Republican blocking of the Dream Act and other bills, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he is confident that once the tax problem is resolved an agenda can be set for the rest of the bills.
"I think we have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that this tax problem must be solved before the end of the year..."
"I think we can get an agreement at some point in that direction and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid announced Tuesday that he will call for a “debate-closing vote” on the Dream Act, which is why the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on starting next Thursday in the Senate, even if the most likely would be next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act would legalize 800,000 young people who arrived in the United States before the age of 16, stayed in the United States for the past five years, and were accepted by a higher education institution or the Army.
But supporters require 60 votes to approve the initiative, which is why they require the help of a large number of Republicans, at a time when the organizations that support the project are lobbying intensely to guarantee the approval of the law.
The Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
Nevertheless, at least one of them, Sen. Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against and only one Republican expressed support for the bill, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
That’s why supporters of the Dream Act require the vote of several Republicans if other Democrats decide to vote against the initiative.
Among the most sought-after Republicans are Senators Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and outgoing Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed the mandate over Senator Mel Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past include Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but they said they would not support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported him, John McCain, has not defined his position so far.
Even though the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act’s biggest hurdles are in the Senate.
With literature we put our finger on the wound
The second stage of the Pleasures of the Language was a walk in which the participants showcased the narration
"Sex in the language, I understand, but... the finger on the wound? what is expected of me?", asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second stage of the Pleasures of the language, a cycle that celebrates literature in Spanish and which this time used the subtitle of his question (during another fair the round table was dedicated to Sex in the language).
The finger on the wound "... embarrasses us", the Argentine writer gently told the audience, most of the young people, who had gathered at the Guadalajara International Book Fair (FIL) to listen to this table moderated by Marisol Shultz and in which Valenzuela, Sergio Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez, Mayra Montero and Luis Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz defined after as a great story, with Luisa in the first person as the protagonist who seeks to know what the "wound" is, she goes from one doctor to another, without getting an answer, only clues in the same narrative thread.
From the infectiologist she comes out convinced: "patience is not my forte, it is perhaps my wound".
At the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who cut his breath in the middle of the corridor, but who explains that wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the wound is what is open in reality, the symbolic is the scar".
The protagonist sighed relieved and concluded: "on the wound I could only know that it is who is open in reality and that it does not exist", but convinced of the fact that the pleasures and traps of the language must be very linked to each other.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez also presented a delightful narration that he titled Praise the Invention, where the finger on the wound is not numbered but at a certain point is discovered.
With touches of magical realism, he speaks of a famous sorceress who touched clouds, sent back people who had gone far or repaired the virtues that a lady had lost, a narrative that turns to speak then America, the great news that had from the beginning its own chroniclers and quoted Bernal D<0xC3><0xAD>az del Castillo who criticizes the excesses of the narratives of the captains.
“Cervantes, who invented us all, made fun of the false witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but in a nice way we would never have told the story of America with an imagination that lacked even modesty.”
Nevertheless, he stressed, "the fools and liars have the best imagination" and here reality converges with the lie, it is no longer known which part of the narrative belongs to one band or another, where fiction literature reaches its peak.
This is known as the “tradition of Cervantes”.
“It’s because of his legacy that we are what we tell.”
In turn, the writer Mayra Montyero annotated and applauded the variety of interpretations provoked by the invitation of the FIL with its round table Le debout sur la plaie.
The Cuban-Puerto Rican put her own on the great wound of the social violence that her country is going through - and Latin America shares - produces disputes of trafficking and sale of drugs.
"I think that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit commitment that is of course not premeditated," she said, after citing that the reality of literature is communication and the dimension of the commitment that is established between the author and readers, and that it is a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The evening ended with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a Montero who also stressed "it must on the wound of the committed writer".
He considered that in a world that lives at great speed also with regard to intellectual habits and the control of consciences that turns to the advantage of dogmatisms, "behind every affirmation there is a small no and behind every negation there is a small yes".
“To be masters of our own feelings and to be masters of reality, we must nuance: and nuance means many times to put your finger on the wound and disturb people who feel very comfortable thinking in caricature, in black and white, in established ideas and without nuance and also to disturb the powers that prefer a world in black and white,” he said.
Romano on the hunt for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in finals he had ups and downs in his career, but he managed to reach the decisive series three times.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, there are also two different styles that confront each other, marked by their technicians, who find a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has had three defeats in finals, he has had ups and downs in his career, but he has managed to reach the decisive series three times, even if so far he has not put in the mile and that is why this opportunity is very special for him.
The Argentine ended up consoling himself with the sub-champion medal, he stayed one step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he played consecutive finals.
The Santos strategist reached his first final as a coach in the 2002 Opening Tournament, when he held the reins of Morelia with which he lost with an overall result of 4-2 against Toluca; later, in the 2003 Closing he also arrived at the decisive duel and lost again with the overall result of 3-1 and this was precisely against Rayados.
With Santos Laguna already, in the 2010 Bicentennial Tournament, again against the Diablos, Rubén suffered a setback again, as his team made an equal match of 2-2 against the Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the series of penalties he got an advantage for 3-1 with two opportunities to get the title and finally three of his players missed the result of 11 meters and he suffered the jump-3.
Rubén has lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his rival in the tournament, therefore he does not want to have the same fate, he tries to detach himself from the evil to be able to celebrate a title for the first time, even if he says that for him the institution is more important.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break any statistics, this is for a club, not for a passion that I have and therefore I will get the title, but what I mentioned before is more important," commented the helmsman when asked what his weak points in the finals would be.
He remembers a lot of the last final, from which he says he learned a lot, "the only lesson we can learn is that until the referee whistles the final, we can not celebrate, we are prepared in the line, the players too, because the last time, with two penalties to shoot we were already prepared to run and I believe the end is one".
He knows that this series could be defined by penalties, which does not worry him, because he confides in his players: "We never try to get to the series of penalties, we try to finish in the regular time, but sometimes we only have to prepare ourselves, the previous tournament we have been prepared, unfortunately the fate has made us a bad turn, sometimes it is the emotions or the anguish of it.
Romano now has the opportunity to no longer be a sub-champion technician and taste for the first time the glory offered by the titles.
The European Union changes the rules for obtaining a visa
Individuals must go to the Visa Applicant Service Centers prior to their interview in the Consular Section; the wait time cost will be reduced.
As of January 10, 2011, the visa processing procedure at the U.S. Embassy and Consulates will change.
Under the new procedure, the majority of applicants will be required to report to the Visa Applicant Service Centres (VSA) prior to their interview in the Consular Section.
CSA staff will take the applicant's biometric information, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages for applicants, including:
The total cost to process the visa will be lower, it will no longer be necessary to make a payment to get an appointment, another payment for the processing of the visa and another for the mail service to deliver the document.
The applicant will make a single payment that will cover all three services.
The current rate will remain the same: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visas with application (this includes visas for temporary workers) and $390 for visas for traders and investors.
Persons wishing to renew their visa will not be required to appear for an interview with the Consular Representative, they will only appear at the nearest CSA where they will present the documents and their fingerprints will be taken.
Due to the fact that biometric information will be taken in the CSA, applicants who want a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will stay there less time than before.
Similarly, visa applicants at the Consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra $26 service fee.

NASA Announces Discovery of Extraterrestrial Life
The U.S. space agency has quoted the press to present tomorrow a discovery that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States will communicate tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery, which could prove the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented at a press conference tomorrow at 1:00 p.m. at NASA Headquarters in Washington for experts in astrobiology, the science that studies the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
When it quoted the press, NASA assured that it would present who will have an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life," which has sparked speculation from experts in other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures similar to us and in hostile environments that were thought to be uninhabited and would put on the table the possibility of becoming intelligent beings like humans if its living conditions are improved.
It seems that we are talking about a microbe discovered at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, which lives in an environment that was thought too poisonous for any life form, because the lake is rich in arsenic.
Anyway, the creature uses arsenic as a way of life and this ability makes us think that a similar life could exist on other planets that do not have our voluntary atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it proves that "there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from the one we know".
The space agency will communicate the true scope of the findings in tomorrow's press conference on Thursday.
The conference will be attended by geobiology Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (the largest satellite of Saturn), from the perspective that its chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
Germ PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n 'block' opposing
With reforms to the Organic Law of the Congress, the arrival of "bipartism" is made possible, it is denounced.
The 60th had just settled when in the Congress appeared an opposition bloc led by the deputies of PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Manuel Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n Montalvo, who declared himself independent and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of 'bipartism' in the Chambers.
Before initiating the installation session of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, of Convergencia; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of PRD; and Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n Montalvo, 'thundered' against the reform of the Organic Law, because it excluded them,
With this reform, they reiterated, “bipartism” is initiated because now there are two people, from the same number of parties, who control the Congress.
These four deputies, along with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of PRD, were the only ones to vote against the Directory chaired by the PANist Salvador L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, as vice-president.
Corvera Quevedo mentioned that these reforms institutionally constitute the political marginality of PRI and PAN.
He mentioned that in the following days they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme starting from a political will and if they do not have it, they will be enslaved again by both parties and in this way will end the opposition coalition.
"So far it has happened (the opposition coalition), that's what I'm looking at, because we are excluded from any decision, they don't even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, from Convergencia mentioned that with PRD, PT and Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n there are coincidences and that is why they form a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that Congress, having been monopolistic, should now be “duopolistic.”
“It is not the spirit of law reform that there is an eternal bipartisanship in Congress.”
To begin with, this group starts with 5 legislators and they are now talking to other colleagues to make them more numerous, the Convergent abounded.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, from PT, explained that now the Congress has turned into a ‘loot’ between two, alluding to PAN and PRI.
“Before there was only one party, now they divide it into two.”
Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n Montalvo asked to respect the personality of the deputy, to give him his place at the negotiating tables.
"That they do not leave by cupular agreements out to 5 that will probably be 9 deputies, now to the five that we are seen, separated in different fractions, we have decided to unite to seek a place in the negotiating table, this is the problem, that in the reform they have done, that they have decided, we are outside and we do not agree with this reform that".
$200 million more for "the supplier"
The City of Mazatlán pays another check to the questioned owner of the electrical equipment company.
Another check of about 200 thousand pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Hall.
With it, the amount paid this second half to the owner of the electrical equipment company amounts to 1 million 200 thousand pesos.
According to the transparency page of the Municipality, this last check number 9258447 was issued last November 16 for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, in concept of "supplier account settlement".
The treasurer Luis Miguel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Moreno had said that the Commune would pay other amounts to this supplier, which was observed by the Superior Audit of the State to sell at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total debt and, therefore, how many more checks will be issued to Camacho Palazuelos.
“We didn’t buy anything, we just pay him what we owe him, like the rest of the suppliers,” he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: on September 24, two on October 15, October 19, October 29, and the latter on November 16.
Although the supplier has not yet published in the Official State Gazette, according to the provisions of the Act when a company is questioned by ASE, to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasurer assured that they have not used its services again.
All this, after July 25, Northwest had published a review of the checks that the City Council issues to its suppliers, revealing that in the interval March 2008 - July 2010, in the triennium of Mayor Jorge Abel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Sánchez, the Municipality paid Camacho Palazuelos more than 10 million pesos, through 42 checks.
He also carried out transactions with Jumapam, cashing checks of more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites must be taken care of
Tourist entrepreneurs regret the accident of the foreign tourist because of the poor conditions of the roundabout Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a hollow of the roundabout Sánchez Taboada, the tourist sector of Mazatlán asked the authorities to pay attention to the areas and sites that are in bad conditions and project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Zona Dorada Merchants Association, recalled that they have repeatedly requested that the image of the destination be taken care of and that new activities should replace others that tourists find bad.
He said the poor condition of the streets and sidewalks has affected as tourists come for walks and they see the mess and avoid nearby shops.
“Politicians don’t know what it means to close a business one day and they don’t know the fortune that is lost, elsewhere they didn’t do the work for so long and without proper planning.”
The hotelier José Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance on the part of the City Council.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and prevent this from happening again, how to do it, so through a preventive maintenance and only make the correction," he said.
"We want to enjoy a clean city, because not only because this is a tourist area we have to maintain it, but as inhabitants who deserve a clean place to live and the City Council must change its strategy to maintain the city well."
There are other sites that are neglected and incomplete, he said, such as Escudo and Venadito de Mazatlán.
"Today, because the tourist comes, it does not depend only on the promotion, there must be a good product, a city that has cleanliness in its beaches, boulevards, permanent maintenance of tourist attractions," he said.
"They have not been given the attention that is needed and this type of fact highlights something that is notorious to all, the interview is necessary."
Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Llera Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez, undersecretary of Tourism Promotion, said that the recovery of tourist sites in Mazatlán is urgent, because they are not used correctly and project a bad image.
He talked about a series of places that have to get in line together with the municipality and be a priority to have the city up to date, clean, orderly and that it is attractive because it has a tourist vocation.
"Fortunately Mazatlán offers a lot of historical and cultural sites and places that we should order first, clean up and put us online to make them attractive so we can add them to the inventory we have to promote this destination."
IP asks Congress for results
Eduardo Dávalos, president of CCE, proposed that MPs take on the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations it faces.
The business sector of Mazatlan is calling for a Labour Legislature that is dignified and free of agreements between the parties and the government executive, because Sinaloa is convulsed and faces major problems.
Yesterday we installed the 60th legislature formed by seven political forces, 19 deputies of PRI, 13 of PAN, three of the New Alliance Party, two of PRD, one of PT, one of Convergencia and one of PVEM, in total 40 popular representatives.
The list of expectations that the new members of the Government Congress is a clean and committed management with society and the different sectors that need responsible legislative work and that the same models of party spirit or paternalism are not repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos, president of CCE, proposed that MPs take on the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations it faces.
"We hope that the deputies really exercise their right, free of agreements between the parties because the custom is that they make pacts to look after their own interests and they turn into a carnival masquerade of the rulers and leaders of the parliamentary fractions."
That is why I ask that they certify the commitment to build the necessary bridges that the current Governor is advancing.
“We will ensure that they do a dignified and above all committed work with society and the sectors because the people of Sinaloa gave them their vote of confidence in the last elections.
José Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Manguart Sánchez, president of the Association of Hotels Tres Islas, considered that one of the great provocations of the 40 popular representatives is to push and add forces by seeking the economic growth of the State, because now the economic situation is very complicated.
“The most important thing is that they push economic growth, that they generate incentives for investment and infrastructure and that in a way will stimulate the generation of jobs.”
With regard to tourism, he asked that the new legislators give it the importance it has in the government budget to consolidate the Secretariat of Government Tourism.
"I understood that this is the second State Secretariat with a smaller budget and it is incongruous as an important economic activity that generates foreign exchange and investment and that competes directly with agribusiness."
Aside from the fact that resources must be classified as detonating tourism projects that help secure the state and update the Alcohol Act that previous legislatures have not been able to resolve.
We're looking for a mage king.
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the desire of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For their parents, the next day of the Magi will be difficult to fulfill their illusions, because their home is formed by no more than 12 people and a kid.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s, José Alfredo, Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Guadalupe, Isa<0xC3><0xAD>as, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchior, Balthazar and Gaspard will wear the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a humble house in Colonia Salvador Allende and they live day to day because their father does not have a stable job.
"Sometimes it's very difficult for us, because my husband doesn't have a job, but we sell tangerines and potatoes... and in the afternoon I go out with the 'plebes' to sell in the street," says Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Adelaide, 4, wants a doll or a bicycle, and her sister Isabel, 3, would like a Barbie doll.
In turn, 10-year-old José Alfredo has long aspired to have a monster truck and for his little brother Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s, 8 months old, Cayetana suggests size clothes for a year.
“He told me (Jose Alfredo), ‘I would like to have this monster,’ but I told him ‘we’ll see, son,’ because he was very expensive,” Cayetana recalled sadly.
For older children, who were at school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Guadalupe, 11, wears size 12; Isa<0xC3><0xAD>as, 10, wears size 10, while Miguel, 8, wears size eight.
14-year-old José Juan needs a pair of sports shoes, so a pair of size five and a half or six would help him a lot.
If you want to help make the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family come true you can participate in the campaign On Looking for King Mage, by giving a toy or money to the reception of Noroeste.
14 suspected drug traffickers arrested
A dozen searches were carried out in the Estrie on Wednesday, as part of the dismantling of a network of production and sale of cannabis.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that would have been used for the production of drugs.
"About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, money and equipment used for production have been seized," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for the S<0xC3><0xBB>reté du Québec.
In all, eleven men and three women were arrested, including the two alleged leaders of this network, two men from Sherbrooke.
Those arrested were to appear at the Sherbrooke courthouse within hours of their arrest.
They could face charges of cannabis production, possession for the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These searches were the result of a long-term investigation, which lasted almost a year.
"This is information received from the public that allowed us to make these arrests," Ruel said.
Some 70 police officers from the regional investigative module of the Estrie de la S<0xC3><0xBB>reté du Québec, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Régie de police Memphrémagog took part in this police operation.
Illegal migration can continue without problems
The Conservatives' bill, which the government says should solve the problem of boats loaded with illegal migrants, will obviously be defeated as the three opposition parties said Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I rely heavily on the Charter."
“I’m standing with a party that created granite under your feet,” said Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, as he was surrounded by MPs after the weekly caucus meeting.
The Liberals claim that the bill as proposed, which would allow for up to one year's detention of anyone from a ship identified as carrying illegal immigrants, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The leader of the Bloc Québécois, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the bill because he was targeting the wrong target.
"We are against it and it seems that all the opposition parties are against it, so we will see what the government will do," Duceppe said.
The NDP’s immigration critic, Olivia Chow, has rejected criticism that her party is not firm enough about illegal immigrants.
"The New Democrats agree that we should take action against human smugglers, and that's what we're doing through another bill, C-35," Chow said.
“We don’t support the Conservatives’ bill because it targets refugees and imprisons children for at least a year,” Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
“Canadians are telling MPs massively that they don’t tolerate this kind of clandestine migration, these criminal operations that target Canada and treat the country like a doormat.”
"They expect Canada to take strong action," said Minister Kenney.
The government did not announce a vote of confidence on its bill, which could have led the country to elections in the event of its rejection.
One Conservative, however, told QMI Agency that the government would ask for a vote so that each MP who opposes it would then explain himself to his constituents.
The new unit does not have unanimity.
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a permanent unit to fight against corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the creation of a public commission of inquiry on the subject.
The Minister of Public Safety, Robert Dutil, argues that this idea does not date from yesterday: Quebec would have consulted the Department of Investigation of New York on this matter as early as last January.
The city has had a permanent corruption unit since 1870.
Tuesday’s announcement surprised more than one.
It must be said that at a meeting of the Permanent Council on Quebec police services on October 29, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
It did not take any more for the public safety critic, Stéphane Bergeron, to describe this announcement as "rabbit out of a hat" and "a tinkering solution on the corner of a table".
Minister Dutil responded to those who fear that political power will have too much influence on the possible future unity.
"You'll see the result when we announce it, he just says."
"We are aware of this problem."
For the president of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of a public inquiry.
"The more Mr. Charest persists in not wanting to create this commission of inquiry, the more people think like you and me that he has something to hide," he explains.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is the resignation of Jean Charest," said Yves Boisvert, a professor of ethics and governance at the <0xC3><0x89>cole nationale d'administration publique.
To get out of this impasse, he suggested that Quebec give the Auditor General a special mandate to investigate collusion and corruption.
"We need to be able to expand the mandate of the Auditor General," he said.
He also believed that Quebec could give the auditor the same powers as a commissioner, allowing him to compel people to testify.
The creation of a permanent squad is not the only project in the Charest government's boxes.
Quebec would also ask Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to be better adapted to this type of crime.
This request would come from the prosecutor of the operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the jurisprudence is not explicit in such investigations.
Federal Public Safety Minister Vic Toews confirmed that his colleague from the Department of Justice, Rob Nicholson, is currently working on some amendments related to this file.
During Operation Spring 2001, which targeted biker groups, even though the Criminal Code was not adapted, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently passed the Gangsterism Act.
Rivers under high surveillance
Several rivers remain under high surveillance due to heavy rainfall that has hit several regions of the province since Tuesday.
A landslide occurred Wednesday afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauricie.
Two houses were evacuated in a preventive manner.
In the evening, another slip would have occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re.
A road has collapsed.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rainfall fell on several regions, from 40 to 70 millimeters of rain.
An additional 20 to 40 millimeters of rain was expected by Thursday evening, according to the regions.
The areas north of the river and in the Outaouais Valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to 100 millimeters of rain in total.
Since these precipitations must be added to the melting of snow already accumulated in some areas, there are fears of overflowing several rivers.
Flood warnings were issued Wednesday night by the Sécurité civile du Québec for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re.
The rivers of the North, in Saint-Jér<0xC3><0xB4>me, in the Laurentians, and of the Oak, in Lotbini<0xC3><0xA8>re, were subject to flood watches and remained under surveillance.
In the Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re region, heavy rainfall caused lakes to overflow at Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was taken away due to heavy rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In the Outaouais, the overflow of some lakes led to the closure of several roads, notably in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
Civil Security remains on alert and is monitoring the situation closely, said Annik Bouchard, a security adviser.
The Centre for the Forecast of Floods in Quebec on Wednesday issued flood warnings for several rivers, including Maskinongé, L'Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Le Loup.
Dupont partially blamed
Québec City radio host Stéphane Dupont has suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council (CBSC) over controversial remarks about social assistance and Haitians as well as his coarse language on the airwaves.
The CBSC found that Mr. Dupont and his team at CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their opinions, but that some of the comments contained "inaccurate information about social assistance, unduly negative representations of Haitians, and gross language that is not appropriate for broadcasts during the day."
The Commission also found that a discussion of suicide, including the release of the names of two persons who had committed suicide, did not violate the broadcasting codes.
The CBSC had received several complaints about comments made during programs broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint by the Front commun des personnes asistées sociales du Québec.
The group complained that the amounts quoted in the issue were inaccurate.
Facilitators should present solid information rather than misleading information.
Regarding suicide, the host Stéphane Dupont had considered that suicide is a cowardly gesture.
The majority of the Committee members concluded that the message was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life's problems.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes in question of 'Dupont du midi' dealt with a sensitive subject in a fair and appropriate manner."
Therefore, no blame was placed on him.
The last dispute concerned statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had then engaged in a media face-to-face that had aroused a lot of reactions.
The host of CHOI said he had not made any donations to help Haitians because it could not be known for sure that needy people would actually receive the money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
“I’ve already served my three-day suspension on it.”
“My file has been blank for a year and a half,” the host said.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the dissemination of foul language.
In each case, the broadcaster CHOI-FM cooperated "beyond its obligation".
The consequences are minimal for the station, which will, among other things, have to announce these decisions once during peak viewing hours within three days.
A King of Kung Fu in Montreal
The Algerian-born Montrealer Nacereddine Zemmal has a very particular career path.
The athlete who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and Thai boxing climbs on the tatami mats and rings of the world in search of new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts such as kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria," explained Zemmal, who has lived in the city since 2008 to work as a professional.
"In my case, I'm looking for fights everywhere, since for those who don't like the ground game in mixed martial arts, competitions are rare in North America."
Recently, the man who works as a security guard and a clerk for UPS just delivered bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) Amateur World Championship, from October 23 to 30, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
“I won the full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing categories,” he said.
"Currently, I am preparing to go to China for the San Shou World Cup."
“Fighters who finished in the top four at the last World Championship in each category were invited.”
"I won bronze in 2009 in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished eighth."
In 2007, in China, I finished the tournament in fifth place, while I finished third in Toronto in 2009, he added.
“What’s interesting is that I’ve progressed in every competition.”
"At this rate, I'll be first this time or next year!"
"San shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originating in China where punching and kicking, as well as throwing on the ground, are allowed.
Duels originally take place on a platform and more rarely in a ring.
The most famous boxer from this form of combat is the Vietnamese American Cung Le, well known in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal has to remember only one event in his career, he will certainly respond to his presence at the super tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of kung fu.
"This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China," explained the friendly guy.
"It's a little bit the equivalent of Lumpinee Stadium (the biggest stadium in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first fight, in the semi-final of his category (80 kg), before losing in the final.
"The one who defeated me was a real pro," he said.
"There are four fighters per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals will face each other in the final of their category."
“Then, the winners of each category face off to crown a single champion, the king of kung fu.”
450 million in contracts without calls for tenders
Hydro-Québec has awarded $450 million in over-the-counter contracts to engineering firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, a consortium formed by BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor obtained the most important, that of the project management, for a sum of 295 million dollars without a call for tenders.
This consortium called <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance was formed in 2004 in conjunction with Hydro-Québec's decision to entrust the private sector with its responsibility for managing this important $5 billion hydroelectric project.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance won the lucrative contract without there being a public tender.
For the Parti Québécois, the use of consortia of companies poses a serious ethical problem that risks eliminating competition and causing a rise in prices.
“This is the new way of colluding and taking down competition.”
"That is to say that people, instead of doing it secretly, now do it openly," said PQ MP Sylvain Simard at a press conference yesterday.
Earlier in the morning, Mr. Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because he says it is difficult to see how the public interest can be served in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, replied in the afternoon, strongly denying that there had been collusion for this contract.
"I'm starting to have my trip," she said, arguing that the PQ had been "dishonest" and had "lacked rigor".
She said "it would be the least of it" for the PQ to apologize.
The consortium formula is a common practice around the world.
It is usually a time-limited alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their respective expertise to respond to a call for tenders for a complex project.
The Eastmain project has a high level of complexity given the scale of the work.
The project is ongoing and is scheduled to run until 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without competition; there was negotiation.
Also, the consortium formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir revealed last week, the formula of consortia in the consulting engineering sector is being investigated by the government.
A quick overview of Quebec’s business register makes it possible to count more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to be permanent.
Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and other Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, brings us back to a single legal entity, namely Dessau.
With respect to the <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the James Bay territory responds to particular workforce dynamics and that Hydro-Québec has responded in a particular way since the 1970s."
The Eastmain project's chief executive, Réal Laporte, of the James Bay Energy Corporation (JBSE), gave an explanation that raised eyebrows about the fact that the project's stewardship contract was awarded over-the-counter.
“If you go to tender and there are few bidders, your prices will be higher.”
"You have two choices: either you take the people who are in that market and you say: we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement and with a good price."
"But the idea is that it's not the price that's important, it's the competence of the people," Laporte said.
This contract awarded to the <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance consortium is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or the SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir counted 109 consulting engineering contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to firms or their subsidiaries, including soil laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin won 22 contracts, Génivar won 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, not to mention its participation in <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance.
All contracts have been negotiated.
They total $449,783,344, including the $295,131,564 energy management contract.
Sylvain Simard suggested that the four firms that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "well known to the Quebec Liberal Party".
Minister Normandeau dropped that the PQ is also linked to these firms that "finance" it, before specifying that it was rather its leaders.
Barometer of responsible consumption - The "green" label does not inspire confidence
Greener, but frankly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has very little confidence in sustainable development stakeholders, but also in fair trade brands and greening certifications to guide their choices.
Worse, even if it bathes in a media universe where messages in favor of more responsible consumption abound, it deplores a lack of credible information, a deficiency that it even qualifies as a brake on its commitment, says the Barometer of responsible consumption, whose first reading was delivered yesterday.
Although Quebecers increased their consumption of so-called socially responsible products in 2010, they seem to give very little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two thirds of them say they do not believe in the environmental commitment of companies as well as the green advertising of companies, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Observatory of Responsible Consumption of the Université Sherbrooke.
Another finding: half of consumers doubt the reliability of official certifications affixed to so-called fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands claiming to be eco-responsible, says the Barometer.
In the same vein, the discourse of politicians on this topic is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebecers.
However, information on responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this segment of consumption currently driven by nearly a third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, the emptiness and dubious nature of the information would calm the ardour of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the Barometer, after the higher price of these products.
In addition, a third of Quebecers are also suspicious of the alleged performance of green products or services that they are trying to get into their hands.
On another note, almost half of consumers in 2010 changed their habits and changed the brand of one or more products to meet their beliefs.
At 61%, they also favored purchases from merchants in their neighborhood and favored the purchase of food products grown in their region, says the Barometer.
Greener and more responsible - the index of responsible consumption has reached 64 out of a maximum of 100 for this year - the Homo consumus of Quebec likes to present itself as the king of recycling that seeks to reduce its environmental footprint by caring about the protection of animals.
But his social and ecological conscience seems to remain outside his car, says the Barometer: in 2010, barely 28% of Quebecers indicated having used public transport or advocated carpooling to defend their green interests.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of participants in this large behavioural survey, which just took its first snapshot.
A state loan for the purchase of eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which has been asked to commit financially to the acquisition of the eXcentris cinema complex by Angus and Le Parall<0xC3><0xA8>le, agrees to collaborate, but only to the extent of a loan.
The Société de développement Angus et le Parall<0xC3><0xA8>le, which had hoped for a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to buy the eXcentris film complex on Boulevard Saint-Laurent from Daniel Langlois by giving it back its full cinephilic vocation, did not get what they were asking for.
The government agrees to get involved, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected donation, the Government of Quebec is proposing a loan whose amount would be lower than the initial expectations, which could be a viable solution on advantageous terms, at least in the opinion of the sources from the state's pharmacies.
A first action plan and a request for $12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but the requests have since been revised downwards.
A proposal and an action plan were sent to Minister St-Pierre by the president of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Macerola, who manages the eXcentris file.
He sent her a final report about ten days ago.
But the cabinet counter-proposal reached SODEC on Tuesday.
The Parallel and Angus have until December 31 to respond.
It seems, however, that the hypothesis of the gift of the State must really be discarded.
Recall that the Association des proprietaires de cinémas et de cineparcs du Québec opposed a direct investment from the State to support the acquisition of eXcentris, arguing that the Minist<0xC3><0xA8>re de la Culture does not have to finance real estate projects, which it has not done for other cinemas.
On the contrary, a number of stakeholders called for substantial economic assistance.
Daniel Langlois, the master of céans, carried the auteur cinema for ten years to its premises of the complex after having financed its construction himself, which could justify a derogation on the part of the Treasury Board.
The lack of theaters for independent films is rampant in Montreal, and eXcentris had managed to retain its clientele.
The Angus Society and the Parallel, headed by Christian Yaccarini, are also running a private financing campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to push the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, only one of the three screens, Le Parall<0xC3><0xA8>le, continues to broadcast films at eXcentris.
The aim of the future buyers is to reopen the three theaters on February 27th by screening the beautiful film by Xavier Beauvois Des hommes et des déux.
But Christian Yaccarini has not recalled Le Devoir and it is unknown what he and his group think of the downward proposals made to them.
The veil lifted on a complex Canada...
The new U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks lift the veil on what the U.S. considers the inferiority complex of Canadians towards Americans, but at the same time betray the feeling of superiority of the latter towards Canada.
Thus, U.S. diplomats are surprised that not every Canadian voter has Canada-U.S. relations in mind when going to vote and believe that President Obama's visit helped the Conservative government pass its budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, laid out in the public square yesterday, offer more crisp details than substantial content to be gleaned.
A cable dated September 22, 2008, in the middle of the federal election campaign, tells how the United States is not part of the issues discussed by political leaders.
To the astonishment of the American ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offers a few explanations for this situation.
“An almost inherent Canadian inferiority complex may condition Canadian political leaders to talk about domestic issues of the day rather than to focus this election on the United States (as in the 1988 free trade campaign),” he writes.
The United States is therefore, he concludes, "the proverbial elephant in this election: ubiquitous, but potentially too threatening to talk about."
The ambassador understands all the less this "silence deafening" as the two countries have an intense political and economic relationship.
“Logically, the ability of a candidate, a party and even more than a party leader to manage this essential relationship should be a key factor that voters have in mind when going to vote.”
The other expression of this sense of importance is in the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, chargé d'affaires in Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
“Your trip will help ensure the government’s survival in the early February confidence vote on the federal budget, by which Canada will post its first deficit in more than a decade because of a $30 billion to $40 billion stimulus plan,” Breese wrote.
Nowhere is it mentioned that the government had to prorogue Parliament before Christmas to avoid being overthrown by the coalition and that the opposition parties made its survival conditional on the quality of the proposed stimulus plan.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington of the increasingly negative image that the drama series aired on CBC is sending back from the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about the shows Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which there are not very subtle references to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or the kidnappings for muscular interrogations of the CIA.
Another cable reports that, during their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to welcome some prisoners from Guantánamo.
Mr. Kouchner answered yes, but on a case-by-case basis.
At the end of the meeting, he handed a paper to the secretary of state about Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin.
"The secretary agreed to review the file."
Finally, it should be noted that the minds are heating up about the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, said on CBC that the person responsible for this massive leak should be "murdered".
He echoed Mike Huckabee in the United States.
A global plan to renovate lighting
The UN proposed yesterday in Canc<0xC3><0xBA>n a plan to renovate domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries to achieve a reduction in greenhouse gases (GHGs) that corresponds to almost one third of the additional reduction that must be achieved to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan follows on from the major concrete projects that the United Nations hopes to adopt in Canc<0xC3><0xBA>n to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments by the industrialized countries.
According to the plan filed yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs that still monopolize 50 to 70% of the market were replaced by compact fluorescent bulbs or, better, by light-emitting diode (LED) bulbs, the bulk of the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of GHG emitted on the planet to illuminate humans would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This is equivalent to 70% of the emissions of the global car fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, major emitters such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans that are expected to increase global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will be necessary to subtract another 5 Gt from this balance sheet to be able to stabilize the rise of the climate to 2 degrees centigrade by 2020 in order to prevent it from becoming out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy dissipates as heat and the rest, 5%, produces light.
With compact fluorescent bulbs, the energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, this energy requirement is reduced by twice as much.
Compact fluorescent bulbs last an average of 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, like those launched by the manufacturer Philips this week - this company also participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, which gives an idea of the possible economy with a replacement plan that would apply to 100 countries.
These brand new bulbs can also work with rheostats in addition to emitting very little heat.
They do not contain any mercury.
Several experts have expressed reservations about CFLs as they contain mercury and should be disposed of as hazardous wastes, which is not always possible in developing countries unless manufacturers set up guidelines.
But, the report says, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the compact fluorescent bulb, but rather coal-fired power plants, which emit a lot of mercury to produce wasted electricity in incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report details the gains each country would make through this international program.
For example, Indonesia would save one billion dollars a year in electricity purchases and eight million tons of CO2, the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants whose construction would cost it 2.5 billion.
C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire nervously awaits announcement of election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the results of the presidential election in C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire to be published "without delay" after the deadline has expired.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need for the Independent Electoral Commission to complete its work and announce the provisional results without further delay," a spokesman for the UN chief said.
"It calls on all Ivorian parties and institutions to show responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the announcement of the provisional results."
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the electoral commission missed Wednesday’s midnight deadline without publishing the results, three days after Sunday’s poll.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the chairman of the CIS said on television that the commission "continued to work" to announce the results.
The calls have multiplied Wednesday in the world for the CIS to finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and the opponent Alassane Ouattara.
But Camp Gbagbo is counting on the Constitutional Council’s cancellation of “fraudulent” votes in the north, held by the former Forces nouvelles (FN) rebellion since the failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, campaign manager of the Ivorian president, said that the intimidation of voters practiced by the FN in the north of the country had deterred supporters of the outgoing president from going to vote.
The entire election could be annulled if the complaints filed by Gbagbo are upheld by the Constitutional Council.
Gbagbo's opponents say the country's highest court is not neutral because it is headed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who denies any connection with the ex-rebels, said the delay in announcing the results was "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but he did not go so far as to claim victory.
His allies claim that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows he has lost and that filing a complaint with the Constitutional Council, after preventing the electoral commission from disseminating the results, would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential election, Sunday, was supposed to crown the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country that remained divided in two for years.
The United Nations on Wednesday warned the Ivorian political class that it could be held responsible for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo finished at the top of the first round, on October 31, with 38% of the vote against 32% in Alassane Ouattara, who received public support from former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remained stable in France in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France within the meaning of the International Labour Office (ILO) remained stable at 9.3% in metropolitan France (9.7% including overseas departments), show the provisional seasonally adjusted (CVS) data published Thursday by INSEE.
The number of unemployed is 2.631 million in metropolitan France.
The data for the second quarter were confirmed at 9.3% of the working population in metropolitan France and 9.7% with the overseas departments.
Over the course of a year, the unemployment rate rose by 0.1 percentage points.
More broadly, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France were not working in the third quarter but wanted to work, whether or not they were available within two weeks to work and whether or not they were looking for a job.
The situation of young people in the labour market has deteriorated further, with a further rise in the unemployment rate to 24.2% in metropolitan France (+0.9 points over three months, +0.5 points over one year) and 25% including the overseas departments.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed as defined by the ILO.
Seniors experienced a slight increase in unemployment, to 6.4% in metropolitan France (+0.2 points over three months as well as over one year), i.e. 482,000 people aged 50 or over, and 6.6% with the DOM.
Only 25-49-year-olds benefited from stable unemployment in the third quarter, at 8.3% in metropolitan France (-0.1 point over three months, +0.1 point over one year) and 8.8% throughout France.
INSEE has not published a monthly unemployment rate since 2006, after a controversy over its method of calculation.
Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (DOM included) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini indicted and detained
Alexandre Guérini, 53, a waste treatment company manager and brother of the PS president of the Bouches-du-Rh<0xC3><0xB4>ne general council, was indicted and jailed at the Luynes prison, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation into alleged fraudulent public procurement.
Alexandre Guérini has been indicted for abuse of corporate property, embezzlement of funds and public property, concealment, active corruption, influence peddling and possession of ammunition, says his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guerini is combative and wants to explain himself on all the questions that the magistrate will ask him, and not fantasies."
"It is easy to prosecute him for a multitude of reprehensible leaders, it is something else to prove them," his lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP before his client's hearing.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the strongman of the PS in the department, Jean-No<0xC3><0xAB>l Guérini, insisted, through his lawyers, to send the judge before his hearing a memo to explain himself.
One of his relatives, Philippe Rapezzi, was also indicted on Wednesday night and jailed.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, his client has never done anything other than operate the landfills he had to manage.
As for the award of contracts or the destination of funds related to their operation, he was never aware of it, said Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former director general of the services of the agglomeration of Aubagne, was indicted on Wednesday for embezzlement of public funds and complicity, and left free under judicial control with prohibition to meet the protagonists of the file.
"My client was able to provide an explanation for the facts that are blamed on him."
"The investigating magistrate took this into account by not depriving him of his freedom," said his lawyer, Yann Arnoux.
Four other people were indicted and released on the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, with judicial supervision for two of them, said the deputy prosecutor of the Republic Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy general manager of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is charged with "trafficking in influence and passive corruption".
Two officials of the agglomeration of Aubagne, Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are indicted one for "subtraction and misappropriation of public goods by a person in charge of a public service mission", the other for "complicity of misappropriation of public funds".
Finally, Alexandre Guérini's partner, Jeannie Peretti, was indicted for "abuse of social property."
Among the people who were confronted with Mr. Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently arrested in a parallel case of fraudulent public procurement involving Corsica.
Investigators suspect his companies of having been used to launder money from the big banditry.
The investigation is being conducted in the context of several judicial information opened against X in April 2009 following anonymous letters, for alleged fraud in the procurement of public contracts, in particular in the waste sector.
From a source close to the investigation, the investigations focus in particular on the conditions of allocation and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne as well as from some cities of the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss case: the Elysee exaggerated the mediation of Syria
For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "espionage", kept opinion on the run in France, put diplomacy on alert, and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the watchful eye of the diplomats of the United States.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some of the undersides of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysee explained its strategy to the Americans, going so far as to give them advice for dealing with their own “hostage” crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French officials have sought to convince Washington that the release of the young Frenchwoman did not have the counterpart of the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and wanted by the American justice for trafficking materials for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they cast a stark light on how the French presidency sought to manipulate the media into accrediting the idea that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had played a central role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
In reality, it was nothing.
A diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to handle hostage cases".
The Elysee's advisor for strategic affairs, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, speak with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain to him the French method.
They advise Americans to do the same to repatriate their own nationals forcibly detained in Iran.
“Make a noise,” they say, “hammer incessantly” in the media the words “fundamental human rights,” “innocent,” “immediate liberation.”
This is necessary in order to embarrass the Iranian regime, which is sensitive to its image.
"Do it all the more as the Iranians are asking you not to do it."
Because, after attempts to discuss through discreet channels, "silence will not solve anything", the Iranians are "masters in delaying maneuvers".
Richier added that the arrest of foreigners is “a familiar Iranian tactic: taking hostages for political blackmail.”
He announces that the release from prison of Clotilde Reiss (which will take place on August 16, the day she takes refuge at the French Embassy) "will require the payment to the Iranians of a large sum of money" (230,000 euros in bail).
And he says the Elysée anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that "will worsen".
The Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of the some 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been out of prison for 12 days, but remains stranded in Iran.
Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition the United States is demanding for illegal trafficking of sensitive electronic equipment to Iran, is released in Paris on the decision of a judge.
The U.S. Embassy, like many observers, wonders about this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which is tracking Iran’s clandestine networks for acquiring equipment for the nuclear program, the expansion of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Did France agree to a bargain?
The liberation of the Iranian against that of the French?
In a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysee, he said, not only “was completely taken by surprise by the judge’s decision,” but sought to oppose it.
"There were lively exchanges between the French presidency and the guardian of the seals" (at the time, Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot reverse the decision", he observes.
Mr Richier also wants to show that Majid Kakavand remains under the "close" surveillance of the French intelligence services.
The adviser of the Elysee dials a phone number, hangs up, and then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian "is currently located in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian embassy."
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée spares no effort, through communiqués and "leaks" organized in the media, to make believe that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad plays an "important" and "influential" role as "mediator".
The Americans observe this activity not without irony, and note that the manipulation bears fruit since several press articles echo the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009 evokes "the media 'blitz' of French officials".
On what is so much "gratitude" expressed to Mr. Assad, asks the embassy in Paris.
“Despite their laudatory statements, French officials privately acknowledge that they have only a vague notion of what the Syrians actually did.”
The document then looks at the reasons that led the Elysée to pour into this fiction.
The intense communication effort "is aimed at validating Sarkozy's policy of openness to Syria," he said.
A policy launched in 2008, which "had then been perceived, by many critical voices in France and abroad, as premature and undeserved".
By “exaggerating the Syrian role”, Paris seeks to “demonstrate to Syria what praise it can attract by playing a constructive role in the region”.
The goal is also to “sow seeds of discord between Syria and Iran.”
The U.S. Embassy knows this from a good source.
On August 11, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier told him: "Of course, we don't know if the Syrians did anything."
“But we thanked them anyway.”
“This should at least cause confusion among Iranians.”
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her at the Elysee Palace.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in favor of the liberation of our compatriot".
No online games for young Koreans past midnight
The South Korean government will pass a so-called “Cinderella” law that will ban teenagers from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials said.
A bill will be submitted to parliament in December to ask online gaming companies to block access to these games after midnight, to young people under the age of 16, said representatives of the ministries of culture and family.
“Many children play these games all night long and then have difficulty studying in school and having a normal life during the day.”
“We believe that this law is necessary to guarantee their health and their right to sleep,” Jo Rin, the minister in charge of the bill, told AFP.
Online games will be available again at 6 a.m.
The companies will have one year to prepare for enforcement, he said.
The government also plans to ask companies to limit the daily access time to these games for young people whose parents request it, the official added.
It will also make available to people who claim it free software that can limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report various facts related to heavy Internet use.
The country is also the undisputed champion of global online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, against 58 other nations.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA designates the organizing countries
In turmoil over suspicions of corruption, FIFA's executive committee on Thursday named the host countries for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, a highly political choice where power struggles and lobbying are likely to take precedence over technical criteria.
One thing is certain, the 2018 edition of the Queen of FIFA competition will take place in Europe, the traditional bastion of the discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The one in 2022 will be much more exotic, with the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a first on the African continent in 2010, or continue its establishment in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities included in the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch heads of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the measure of the economic and political stakes of a World Cup.
Behind-the-scenes trading is likely to last until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy between the candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) dossiers have better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not weigh very heavily on the 22 members of the executive committee at voting time.
The Sunday Times, at the origin of the revelations that led to the suspension for corruption of two members of the EC (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have thus ruined the chances of his country, the cradle of football that hosted the World Cup only once, in 1966.
The BBC handed over a layer on Monday, airing a documentary that pinned three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
This is enough to upset FIFA and embarrass English officials, who have engaged in intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron in the front line.
The head of government hopes to repeat the successful coup by his predecessor Tony Blair, who had obtained in 2005 for London the organization of the Olympics-2012.
Will this intense activity be enough to restore the coat of arms of England to the EC?
Nothing is less certain because the Spain-Portugal duo does not lack assets with its already ready stadiums, its expertise (Mondial-82 in Spain, JO-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the bleak economic and financial prospects of the two countries could overwhelm their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase the rating of Russia, which has become an important outsider despite the shortcomings of its file (stadiums, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to make the trip to Zurich and denounced "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in a barely veiled allusion to the accusations of the English press against the members of the EC.
“We cover them with mud, we try to compromise them,” Putin said.
For 2022, the United States, strengthened by the experience of 1994, appears as the logical favorites.
As the world's leading economic power and home to FIFA's main sponsors, the country seems to be a step ahead of Japan and South Korea, which have separately built a very beautiful project.
But these new applications appear premature for two countries that co-organised the event in 2002.
Another threat: the granting of the 2026 World Cup to China, ardently desired by FIFA, which would de facto nullify the Asian chances for 2022.
With Qatar, which has pulled off the big game by offering futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion to new countries, but both countries present more risks than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also suffer from the weakness of the TV rights paid (due to the time difference) by European countries, the nerve of the war for FIFA.
Second term: The obvious
De Gaulle was hesitant.
Mitterrand had made it appear that he was hesitating.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had no hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than them.
A warrant at the Elysee calls for another.
So the current head of state will be a candidate in 2012.
But the evidence does not go well with the part of mystery attached to the presidential function.
We have to act as if there is still doubt.
In one sense as in the other.
In 2006, even without believing it, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that a third term was not excluded.
On November 15, with a grave air, Nicolas Sarkozy assured that he would make his decision "somewhere in the autumn of 2011".
That he evokes in front of parliamentarians UMP, Tuesday evening at the Elysée, the prospect of "two mandates" has sowed a little feverishness.
Was this the official announcement of his candidacy?
We were a long way from it.
The president merely pointed out that the 2008 constitutional revision limited the number of five-year terms to two.
He made a statement, not an announcement.
This is not the first time he has mentioned the presidential election, in a humorous tone, during such meetings.
"At worst, or at best, you still have seven and a half years with me," he told them in July 2009.
Rebel in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not thinking about the next step."
His words of the day before yesterday do not make him any more a candidate than he was the day before; they do not make him any less.
If there are comments, it is for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race for the candidacy to the PS, on the one hand.
But it is not the entry into the race of Ségol<0xC3><0xA8>ne Royal that pushes Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
It is on the contrary because his candidacy in 2012 is obvious that many in the PS are demanding an order of battle earlier than expected.
Bad polls, on the other hand.
For the first time right-wing voters would prefer the candidacy of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion at the UMP on this," the Prime Minister's entourage reacted immediately and cautiously.
“If he believes the defeat is possible, he will not be a candidate,” Raffarin said.
"He will always believe he can win," corrects Alain Juppé, resigned to the obvious.
Euro: ECB forced to maintain purchases of government bonds
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year was supposed to be an opportunity to clarify the way out of the crisis or, at least, to announce the cessation of many of the unconventional monetary policy operations that are to be completed at the end of the year.
As a result of the European sovereign debt crisis, the Frankfurt Issuing Authority will probably not be able to afford to be so peremptory, otherwise it will aggravate a more than tense situation on European bond markets today.
The political cost would be even higher.
Yesterday, during a press conference, the French Minister of Finance, Christine Lagarde, praised the active role played by the ECB in resolving the debt crisis of States in Europe.
It declined to say whether it felt the central bank needed to do more, for example by increasing its sovereign bond-buying program.
"I reserve my thoughts for my European partners (...) ".
The day before, in Brussels, during his hearing by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not show more discretion as to his intentions, merely indicating that the program of buying government securities on the secondary market "continued" and that "we will see what we decide" at the meeting of this.
The only certainty is that the ECB will keep its main policy rate unchanged at 1%, its lowest level since May 2009.
In fact, the ECB’s purchases of Treasury bonds doubled last week to nearly €1.35 billion.
And, according to the indiscretions of market operators, it made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese securities yesterday.
In total, the Eurosystem's central banks have bought for €67 billion since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt about the expectations of a continuation of purchases (see page 29).
Economists also do not expect a noticeable change of course.
If longer-than-three-month lending operations have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the ECB still makes unlimited allocations of liquidity on generous terms and for periods ranging from one week to three months.
Economists now expect this to be extended by a few months.
"I can't imagine she's changing her schedule in any significant way."
“Otherwise it would risk provoking further tensions in the short term,” said Michael Schubert, an economist at Commerzbank.
"A gradual exit announced in the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely," said Norbert Br<0xC3><0xA4>ms, an economist at Sal.
- Oppenheim.
In terms of its interventions in the public debt market, "the ECB should maintain a buying volume of these bonds to animate a sluggish market", adds Norbert Br<0xC3><0xA4>ms.
Given the importance of European banks' exposures to euro area sovereign debt markets, the Issuing Authority has no choice but to maintain its market presence.
"It must at all costs replace the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent a runaway of the returns paid by the most fragile states," said a senior bond manager yesterday.
Because if interest rates soar, states will be all the more embarrassed to reduce their debt, if not stabilize it.
The preservation of the euro is at this price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government is turning a blind eye
After a worrisome start to the week for Italy, the situation relaxed a bit yesterday with the ebb in 10-year bond yields.
A return to precarious calm.
At the end of a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional presidents said they had heard Giulio Tremonti describe the situation as "indecipherable" and expected an "unpredictable" weekend, which the interested party later denied.
By Tuesday, however, the spread with Germany’s long-term interest rates had reached a record 210 basis points and the price of hedging contracts against the risk of bankruptcy (CDS) had soared to 263 points, causing some panic in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi pointed out that in Spain the difference with German rates was more than 400 basis points.
But his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, said he was "strongly concerned" about "market turbulence" and possible contagion from Ireland.
“The good news is that Italy, the eurozone’s third largest economy, is not like Greece or Ireland.”
“The bad news is that it’s like Portugal,” says Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly, its problem is the lack of growth and the lack of tax revenues that goes with it, making the State run the risk of no longer being able to cover its financing needs.
Brussels’ latest forecasts have been a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected at 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget currently under consideration in the Senate is 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, calculates the European Commission, the public deficit will still represent 4.3% of GDP next year (against 3.9% expected by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumor of a new budget collective that could be set up after the holidays, for an amount of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, further austerity measures will have to be taken," said Olli Rehn, the EU's economic affairs commissioner.
For the time being, Italy is receiving support from international institutions.
"The fundamentals of its economy are in order and its accounts are good, we have been saying this for a long time," said Arrigo Sadun, Italy's managing director at the IMF's International Monetary Fund.
"There is no problem in the immediate, short or long term, because despite its high debt (119.2 percent of GDP in 2011), the stabilization efforts required of Italy are less than those required of other countries," observes Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist at the OECD.
Then there is the question of political instability.
On December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will face a vote of no confidence in the Chamber of Deputies, after which early elections could be held at the end of March.
This would open a period not conducive to decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on strengthening anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde said at a press conference in Paris yesterday: "The Europeans, I believe that we have demonstrated again Sunday in the day and night, are obviously united, determined, committed to defend their currency and their currency zone."
Although all relative, yesterday’s easing in European government bond rates has brought water to the mills of governments and the ECB.
But we cannot yet speak of a beginning of normalization.
Ratings agency Standard & Poor's has announced it could downgrade Portugal's debt rating, the target most targeted by speculation today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, which weighs particularly on banking systems," say the economists of Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially since “political time is much slower than market time”.
Aware of this hiatus and the dangers it entails, European countries are intensifying discussions to strengthen existing anti-crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between the finance ministers most directly concerned and, more broadly, with their G20 peers are well under way.
And this is also in view of the meetings of the Eurogroup and the Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the menu, the fate of unconventional measures to support euro area countries in the eye of the markets (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), its executive director, Klaus Regling, began Tuesday in Singapore a tour of Asia to inform Far Eastern investors of the developments of the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it is certainly preparing the ground for them.
The first EFSF bond issues are scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, a US official told Reuters that the US would support a possible increase in the funds mobilized through an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
The countries on the front line, Portugal and Spain, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly in terms of the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms that add to the austerity measures with a closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to take a different path from those of Greece and Ireland.
Both sides are keen to avoid requesting international assistance before implementing their own budget corrections and deciding on the structural reforms that are essential to restoring lasting confidence.
Finally, European donors are discussing the options available to speed up the process of normalisation of sovereign bond markets.
Speaking in Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber first put forward the idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to hand over its portfolio.
The economists of Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European sovereign debt market, believe that an extension of about 100 billion euros would be enough, "preferably" in the form of direct liquidity injection.
The vehicle exists: it is the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism with €60 billion to date.
A council that has every chance of being scrutinized carefully in European capitals.
Especially if market conditions get worse.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in orange vigilance
Snowy episodes still cause traffic difficulties, especially on the secondary network in Brittany, and may disrupt some economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now on orange alert due to the risk of snow and ice.
The Eure, the Eure-et-Loir, the Deux-S<0xC3><0xA8>vres and the Vienne, have been added to the 20 departments already in orange vigilance, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, later in the night.
According to Météo France, heavy snow showers affect the north of the Gironde and the Charentes and there is little snow on the Ile-de-France.
Layers of snow ranging from 2 to 5 cm, occasionally from 7 to 10 cm, are expected for the departments concerned, and from 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm for the Paris region.
The departments concerned are those of the Charente, Charente-Maritime, C<0xC3><0xB4>tes d'Armor, Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the regions Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
Snow episodes are significant enough to cause traffic difficulties and disrupt certain economic activities, warns Météo France.
In the C<0xC3><0xB4>tes d'Armor, several departmental roads have been banned for heavy goods vehicles weighing more than 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac roads.
Traffic on the secondary network in Brittany is very difficult according to the gendarmes who recommend taking his vehicle only in case of necessity and the circulation of some TER buses has been suspended for the day.
School transport was banned for Thursday in Picardy.
No specific measures were envisaged on Wednesday evening to restrict the movement of heavy goods vehicles.
The prefecture "invites all motorists to exercise the utmost caution on the roads and to adapt their driving accordingly".
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGAC) has asked airlines to cancel on Thursday 25% of their flights at the Paris Roissy airport and 10% in Orly due to the upcoming snowfall.
The DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh Airport, in Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate over the modernization of transport in the Ile-de-France is in full swing, billions are raining down.
In the discussion at least.
In particular, we mention 23 billion for the Grand Paris metro to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
To start this GSP, the State has announced a capital endowment of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, it is this sum that will then allow the SGP to borrow on the markets a share of the financing of its double loop.
Today, we finally get to the first additions.
The 2010 amending finance law, which was examined in the Finance Committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains the arrangements for finding the beginning of this money.
They are two: the creation of a special equipment tax and an increase in the tax on offices in Ile-de-France.
The first, we read in the text of the bill, section 15, is "for the benefit of the public establishment Société du Grand Paris".
“The revenue from this tax is 117 million euros per year.”
The second is a reorganization of a tax on offices that already exists "in order to modernize it, to increase the product and to assign this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that pay?
Mystery.
It is not encrypted in the text.
It is far from $4 billion.
"It is specified that these tax resources are in addition to the 4 billion euros of the capital endowment that will be mobilized by the State and provided to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses," the statement said.
At SGP, we do not find this system shocking.
"From the moment we create revenue (both taxes, ed.), we can cover the studies over three years and then type in the 4 billion after, they explain."
“It will be budgeted and pulled as it goes.”
The GSP estimates that the 4 billion will begin to be registered in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This arrangement, in which the promised $4 billion is still available to absent subscribers, risks provoking a somewhat agitated parliamentary discussion.
First public meeting on December 7.
Vengeful Hackers and Spies in Diligence
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it reveals itself as an apparent scandal, a scandal that appears as a scandal only in the face of the hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it heralds profound changes at the international level, and foreshadows a future dominated by regression.
But let's do it in order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that every file made up of a secret service (of any nation) is composed exclusively of press clippings.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits only report what for months could be read in any newspaper (except those owned by Berlusconi), and the sinisterly caricatured profile of Gaddafi had long been for the artists of cabaret sketch material.
The rule that secret files should be composed only of news already known is essential to the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a bookstore devoted to esoteric publications, you will see that each work repeats (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Ch<0xC3><0xA2>teau, the Templars or the Rose-Croix) exactly what was already written in the previous works.
And this is not only because the author of occult texts does not like to do new research (nor does he know where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who devote themselves to occultism believe only in what they already know, and who reconfirms what they had already learned.
This is the mechanism of Dan Brown’s success.
Same goes for secret files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or of limited mind) the head of the secret services (otherwise he could be, what do I know, editor at Liberation), who holds as true only what he recognizes.
The top secret information about Berlusconi that the U.S. Embassy in Rome was sending to the State Department was the same as Newsweek had published the week before.
So why did the revelations on these files make so much noise?
On the one hand, they say what every educated person already knows, namely that embassies, at least since the end of World War II, and since heads of state can call each other or take a plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small representative exercises, have turned into spy centers.
Any viewer of investigative films knows this very well, and it is only through hypocrisy that one pretends to ignore it.
However, repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy, and serves to cast a bad light on American diplomacy.
Second, the idea that any hacker can capture the most secretive secrets of the most powerful country in the world is a significant blow to the prestige of the State Department.
Therefore, the scandal does not put the victims as much in crisis as the "burreaux".
But let’s get to the deeper nature of what happened.
Back in Orwell’s day, you could think of all power as a Big Brother controlling every move of his subjects.
The Orwellian prophecy had been completely proven since, being able to control every movement through the telephone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the highway taken and so on, the citizen became the total victim of the eye of power.
But when it is demonstrated, as it happens now, that even the crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control report ceases to be unidirectional and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker — elected as the citizen’s avenger — can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that no longer has the ability to keep its own secrets hold?
It is true, Georg Simmel already said, that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is true, too, that knowing everything about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed an empty secret, because it is in the public domain; but revealing, as WikiLeaks did, that Hillary Clinton’s secrets were empty secrets means taking away all power.
WikiLeaks has done no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but has done too much harm to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound inflicted on a very powerful power?
It is obvious that in the future, States will no longer be able to put any reserved information online - that would be to publish it on a poster glued to the corner of the street.
But it is equally obvious that with current technologies, it is futile to hope to be able to maintain confidential reports over the phone.
There is nothing easier than finding out if and when a head of state flew in and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can private and reserved relationships be maintained in the future?
I know that, for the moment, my prediction is science fiction and therefore romantic, but I am forced to imagine government agents who move discreetly in stagecoaches with uncontrollable routes, carrying only messages learned by heart or, at most, hiding the rare information written in the heel of a shoe.
The information will be kept as a single copy in locked drawers: basically, the Watergate spying attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is now advancing in crab, i.e. backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet has re-established a telegraph over (telephone) wires.
The (analog) videocassettes had allowed film researchers to explore a film step by step, going back and forth and discovering all the secrets of editing, while now the (digital) CDs only allow to skip from chapter to chapter, that is to say by macroportions.
With high-speed trains, one goes from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, and the journeys it includes, it takes three and a half hours.
It is not extraordinary, therefore, that politics and communication techniques should revert to horse-drawn carriages.
One last observation.
In the past, the press tried to understand what was going on in the secret of the embassies.
Now, it is the embassies that are asking the press for confidential information.
Climate: how France cheats on its funding promises
One year after the Copenhagen Accord, it is time to examine the fulfilment of the promises of fast-start or early-stage financing made by developed countries.
And the big French hacks are revealed.
In the Copenhagen Accord, developed countries committed to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has pledged 7.2 billion euros over three years and France 1.26 billion euros (or 420 million per year).
At the opening of COP16, the EU took the big game out to persuade its partners of the reality of its commitment to fast start financing: report detailing the action of its member states, press conference, large side event, distribution of brochures...
The transparency operation is valuable and appreciated: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same with the same level of precision.
The EU announced that it had raised €2.2 billion in 2010, putting it on track to deliver on its €7.2 billion commitment in 2012.
But when you look at the details, things are more complicated.
This money must be, according to the Copenhagen agreement, "new and additional", in order to ensure that an additional effort is made without being to the detriment of Official Development Assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission had proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits him best.
For example, the European Commission considered 2009 as the reference year: international funding is maintained, and it adds 150 million over three years for fast start financing.
Other countries have chosen similar benchmarks in terms of year or level of official development assistance.
In contrast, France considers that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 are "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to expenditure in previous years or to the overall level of Official Development Assistance.
In concrete terms, the total amount of France’s support to developing countries may remain stable (or even decrease), it claims to respect its commitment to “new and additional” financing...
Another crucial element is the distribution between donations and loans.
Again, there is no rule and everyone chooses their own method of calculation.
Some, like France, consider that 1€ loaned is equivalent to 1€ given.
Of course, this is hardly justifiable: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often projects related to the mitigation of emissions that are based on more efficient technologies), it is false to present a euro that will be recovered as equivalent to a euro that is given ... At most, should be counted under its commitments only the cost of the loan for the lending country (i.e. the equivalent rate of interest).
But France has nothing to do with such reasoning: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by making 91.5% of loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% of donations (36.1 million euros) - see the EU document to check for yourself.
It is the only country in the Union to make such extensive use of the loan.
Germany requires 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (in others) meet their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union spends €1 to meet its commitment, France spends only 10 cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
That's a nice sleight of hand!
In summary, in its fast start financing, France operates a double scam: on the one hand on the evolution of the action over time and on the other hand on the reality of the financial effort.
By spending only 36.1 million euros, it manages to make believe that it spends 420 million "new and additional" in line with its promises.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that it was Bercy who carried out the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would the other member states continue to give if it is enough to lend?) and in the negotiations since the developing countries are not completely fooled...
The chapter on early funding is only a small, relatively short-term issue compared to the whole climate discussion.
But it could be one more grain of sand in the huge machine that is the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this is not the case.
In any case, it is essential to learn the lessons of this first year of early funding.
First of all, France could announce a change in its method of accounting for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and fairness with the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France could advance discussions on the issues of long-term financing (another crucial chapter currently discussed): we will not escape the question of "additionality" or the method of accounting for loans.
France could change its position to become as progressive on these issues as it is on others.
The hope is therefore based on the new Minister of the Environment, Mrs. Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement about France’s fast start and its vision of “additionality” and the use of loans would increase the level of international confidence needed to move forward in the talks.
Alert to pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old child ingests 81 different chemicals in a day, according to a study published Wednesday by the association Générations Futures (formerly Movement for the Rights and Respect of Future Generations).
The association, which warns that its results "do not have significant statistical value with regard to the small number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem treated", bought between July and September the food usually consumed in four meals and a snack in a day by a child of about ten years, in the supermarkets of Oise and Paris.
These typical meals, including the official recommendations - five fresh fruits and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water per day - as well as treats, were examined by laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance sheet is overwhelming: 81 chemical substances of which 42 are classified as possible or probable carcinogens and five substances classified as certain carcinogens as well as 37 substances likely to act as endocrine disruptors (EP), according to studies by several institutions such as the International Agency for Research on Cancer.
"Although, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each chemical taken individually are not exceeded, it is clear from our investigation that the reality of consumer exposure to potentially carcinogenic contaminants and/or PE is of concern," the association notes.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three proven to be certain carcinogens as well as nearly twenty residues likely to disrupt the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, intended as a snack by the study, has traces of six chemicals including a fungicide banned in France.
The same goes for Kenyan green beans, included in the luncheon, on which the study detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, minced steak, canned tuna, and even breadstick and chewing gum were loaded with pesticides and other chemicals.
In the tap water the analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
For dinner, the salmon steak was the "richest" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the examination of the plastic plate used to warm the meal in the microwave was not exempt.
The ultimate risk to the consumer of this “contaminant cocktail” “is probably underestimated,” according to the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV), for its part, proposed "faced with the urgency of the situation" to establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides, in order to stop "the increase in diseases of civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) reported the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruits and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
