Members of the Assembly (AM) in Wales are concerned about "seeming muppets"
Some Members of the Assembly are puzzled by the suggestion that their title should be changed to Members of the Wales Parliament (MWP).
This confusion arises from plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Wales Parliament.
Members of the Assembly of the entire political spectrum are concerned that this can be ridiculed.
A member of the Labour Party Assembly stated that his group was concerned about "remaining with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, twp means dumb and pwp means poop.
A member of the Wales Party Assembly commented that his entire group was "discontent" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Wales Conservative Party stated that their group was "open" to change their name, but noted that the MWP-muppet pronunciation leap was small.
In this context, the pronunciation of the letter w in Welsh is similar to that of Yorkshire's English letter u.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the change of name, states: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptive element of the designation of Members of the Assembly will be the matter of the members themselves."
The Wales Government Act 2017 granted the Wales Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation of the proposals which revealed broad support for calling the Parliament of Wales to the Assembly.
On the issue of the title of Members of the Assembly, the Commission preferred members of the Wales Parliament (or WMP), but the MWP option obtained most of the support in a public consultation.
Members of the Assembly appear to be suggesting alternative options, but the struggle for consensus could lead to the President of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who should send the bill on changes in a few weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes related to the operation of the assembly, such as rules on the rehabilitation of Assembly members and the design of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will have the last word on the question of what should be called when they decide on legislation.
Macedonians go to the polls to vote a referendum on the change of country name
The voters will vote on Sunday if the name of their country is to be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was convened in an attempt to resolve a decades-old conflict with the neighbouring country, Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has always insisted that its neighbour's name in the north constitutes a claim from its territory and has repeatedly opposed its candidacy of EU and NATO membership.
The President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the plebiscite on the change of name, has stated that he will ignore the vote.
However, referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change in name is simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of San Martin remain silent because of the difficulties of the churches of Harlem
"Historically, the older people I've spoken to say there was a bar and a church in every corner," says Mr. Adams.
"Today, there is neither one thing nor the other."
He pointed out that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"People are now socializing differently," he says.
"The bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhoods that the neighbors regularly go to."
With regard to the churches, he is concerned that the money obtained from the sale of property will not last as long as the leaders expect and that "before or after, they will return to the point of departure".
The churches, he added, could be replaced by buildings of apartments full of the type of people who will not help the shrines remaining in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people," he said, "and therefore will speed up the closure of these churches, as most people who move to these apartments are unlikely to become members of these churches."
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and San Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation left in the 1930 ’ s.
A black congregation worshipping nearby acquired the building.
A black congregation took the reins of San Martín, under the direction of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of street 125 merchants, a main shopping street in Harlem, which resisted hiring or promoting black people.
In 1939, a fire left the building severely damaged and, while Father Johnson's parishioners made plans for their reconstruction, they also ordered the cart.
Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson in San Martin, proudly called him "the campaigns of the poor."
In July, the expert who played the cart called "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
In addition, the expert, Tiffany Ng, from the University of Michigan, pointed out that he was the first truck in the world used by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who left to play the largest Riverside Church truck 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather commented that St. Martin did not replace him.
What has happened in San Martín in recent months has been a complicated history of architects and contractors, some brought by the lay leaders of the church and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parish council, the governing body of the parish, composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July commenting on its concern that the diocese "will try to pass the costs" to the council, although it had not participated in the hiring of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark hits a 13-year-old boy who was diving for lobsters in California
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving in search of lobsters in California on the day the lobster season opened, according to the authorities.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach, in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel informed the San Diego KSWB-TV channel that he had been diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the child asking for help, so he approached a group to get him out of the water.
Hammel commented that, at first, he thought he was just excited to have caught a lobster, but then he realized that he was "screaming that he had been bitten"
Error: unknown connection: %s
He had the broken clavicle," Hammel observed when he arrived next to the child.
"Greeting everyone out of the water because there was a shark," Hammel added.
The child was transported by helicopter to the Rady Children Hospital, where he is in critical condition.
The kind of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, commented on a press conference that had been sighted by a shark in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had not been considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim showed traumatic injuries in the upper torso area.
Authorities closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach, Casablad, to Swami Beach, Encinitas, for 48 hours to investigate and for security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans drive the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's acquire Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams, which have many employees specialized in the corridors of their style and beauty establishments.
In order to drive significantly the UK beauty market, valued at 2800 billion pounds and with growth going up compared to the fall in fashion and household household sales, the largest beauty corridors will be tested in 11 stores across the country and, if they successfully overcome it, the same will be done in more stores next year.
The investment in beauty comes at the same time as this chain of supermarkets seeks ways to use the space in shelves that used to be used for televisions, microwaves and household appliances.
Sainsbury's stated that it would double its beauty offer with up to 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essee, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
In addition, more space will be given to existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees ranges, with areas similar to those of other establishments, such as Boots.
The chain will also relaunch its Boutique make-up range with a majority of animal-friendly products, something increasingly demanded by younger customers.
Also, in the perfume shop The Fragrance Shop will try its concessions in two Sainsbury's establishments, the first newly inaugurated in Croydon, in southern London last week. The second will be inaugurated in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
The online shops and the change to the daily purchase of small amounts of food in local shops force supermarkets to strive to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, the executive director of Sainsbury's, has said that stores will increasingly look like malls while the supermarket chain tries to fight Aldi and Lidl discount establishments by offering more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has integrated points of sale of Argos discounts into hundreds of establishments and has introduced several Habitats since their purchase of these chains two years ago. It is considered that this has boosted the sales of edibles and profitable more these acquisitions.
The previous attempt of the supermarket chain to renew its beauty and pharmacy departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint operation with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended after a discussion on how to divide the revenues from the outlets of pharmaceutical products into their supermarkets.
The new strategy arises after the sale of the 281 pharmaceutical establishments from Sainsbury to Celesio, a company owned by Lloyds Pharmacy, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
It is noted that Lloyds will participate in the plan, adding an expanded range of luxury brands for skin care, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
As Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's commented: "We have transformed the look and the atmosphere of our beauty corridors so that they enhance the environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in a specialized staff that will be available to provide advice.
Our brand offer is designed to suit all needs. On the other hand, an attractive environment and a comfortable location makes us an irresistible destination of beauty products, challenging the old way to buy".
Peter Jones is "furious" after Holly Willoughby breaks a £11 million deal
Peter Jones, Dragon's Den's star, went "furious" after television host Holly Willoughby broke a £11 million deal with her lifestyle business line to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time to dedicate to the fashion brand and Truly add-ons.
This business had compared with the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old presenter of This Morning announced that she was leaving the business on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has angered Peter Jones, the star of Dragon's Den, by abandoning his lucrative lifestyle business in the last minute to focus on his extraordinary new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to the sources consulted, Jones was "furious" when the gold girl on television admitted that her new agreements, valued at up to 1.5 million pounds, did not leave time to dedicate themselves to Truly, her fashion brand and complements, during a tense meeting held on Tuesday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire.
The business had been compared with Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was profiled as a favorite to double Willoughby's fortune of about 11 million pounds.
While Willoughby, 37, announced that he was leaving business on Instagram, Jones was leaving Britain to go to one of his holiday homes.
As one consulted source commented: "Truly was, unlike, Holly's top priority.
It was going to be her long-term future, which would keep her in the next two decades.
His decision to abandon left all those involved totally amazed.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of merchandise at Marlow's headquarters, products ready to be put on sale."
Experts believe that the release of this morning's presenter, one of Britain's most profitable stars, could cost the company millions because of the important investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing, and possibly further delay its launch.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are parents of three children and ten years ago they have maintained a close relationship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby established Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
Couples went on vacation together and Jones had a 40% share in Baldwin's television producer.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of the I'm A Celebrity program on the ITV channel.
A source near Jones said that last night "no business issues were discussed."
A difficult conversation "and then we fall in love"
He joked about the criticisms he received from the media for making a comment that some would consider "presidential little" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump commented with his mocking voice of "news presenter."
"I haven't given up on anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in meeting with him again after Trump commended the first meeting held in June in Singapore, which considered a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations for denuclearization have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's leading diplomat Ri Yong Ho, explained to the world leaders gathered at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that his country does not see an "appropriate response" from the US to the first steps towards North Korea's disarmament.
On the contrary, he pointed out, the US continues to apply sanctions in order to maintain pressure.
Trump's perspective was much more optimistic in the speech he gave during his rally.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a fantastic relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have generated positive results: the end of the missile tests, help to free hostages and bring the remains of U.S. soldiers back home.
In addition, he defended his unusual approach in talking about relations with Kim.
"It's very easy to be presidential, but so, instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded stadium, we would have about 200 people right here," Trump said, pointing out to people who were right in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated an island, leaving hundreds of dead
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that their assistance was not necessary.
Although more than 10 per cent of Lombok ' s population had to move, no national emergency was declared, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they do not apply for international assistance, which complicates things a bit," explains Mrs. Sumbung.
Although Save the Children is preparing a team that will send to Palu, they are not yet sure whether foreign staff can work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the national emergency agency, explained that the authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organizations were allowed to assist.
Considering that the land is constantly moving in Indonesia, the country remains incredibly unprepared when nature unleashes its anger.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, there are not so many other coastal areas.
It is likely that the apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, even if there was a prior warning, has contributed to the loss of life.
In the best case, traveling from one island in Indonesia to another poses a challenge.
Natural disasters further complicate logistics.
A hospital ship in Lombok to meet the victims of the earthquake is heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the enclave of the new catastrophe.
President Joko Widodo turned Indonesia’s worn-out infrastructure into the central axis of its electoral campaign, and has allocated enough money to roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding has affected Mr Joko's administration, which faces a re-election next year.
In addition, it must address the pressure of persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands had to leave their homes while bands of Christians and Muslims fought in the streets using machetes, arches and arrows, and other rudimentary weapons.
Look at this: Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool, match the score before Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat in the Premier League in front of Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at London's Stamford Bridge.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri just over 27 metres from Chelsea's marina when the scorer was 1-0.
He placed the ball on his left foot with a touch before throwing it to the second pole.
The action sent him over the area and headed towards the top right corner of the network.
Finally, the ball passed over Kepa Arrizabalaga who tried to stop him with a jump and fell on the net.
"I was trying to put myself in that position to make me with the ball and players like Shaq always play very advanced, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kant approaching and gave him a touch. I didn't think about it too much, just shooting."
Chelsea was winning 1-0 in the first half after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th.
The midpoint of the Blues made a heel pass to Mateo Kovacic in that play, before turning making a watering near the middle field and entering the Liverpool field.
Kovacic quickly passed the ball and ran out in the middle field.
Then he took a nice walk to the space that took Hazard to the area.
Hazard stood in front of the defense and finished throwing the ball to the second pole net with a kick with the left foot that Alisson Becker, of Liverpool, could not stop.
On Wednesday at 3 p.m., Liverpool plays against Naples in the Champions League group phase. The meeting will be held at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea faces Videoton at UEFA Europe League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami increases to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has increased to 832, as reported by the country's emergency agency at the first hour of Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the debris of the buildings that collapsed during the magnitude 7,5 earthquake that occurred on Friday and unleashed waves of up to six metres, said the agency spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho during a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with remains of the collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man as a suspect of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been opened after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 with stab wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, which led to the arrest of a 32-year-old man as a murder suspect.
The police have urged people in the area who have seen or heard anything coming to the police.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan commented: "The investigation is in the early stages, but it would encourage anyone who was near Jonh Street in Birkenhead, and who has seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
In addition, I would recommend to anyone, especially taxi drivers, that I have been able to pick up something in Dashcam that will contact us, as they may have vital information for our investigation."
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body has been found is from Birkenhead and found herself inside a property.
This afternoon, some people who think they met the woman came to the scene of the crime to find out where they found her this morning.
The investigation is under way and the police have reported that they are in the process of informing the victim ' s relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has tried to get back into his apartment, but the police tell him no one can get in or out of the building.
He was perplexed when he discovered what had happened.
Now, residents are informed that they will be allowed back in within a few hours.
Someone heard an agent tell a man that the whole area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in the room in tears.
He keeps saying "it's terrible."
At two o'clock in the afternoon, there were two police vans inside the cordon and one outside.
Several agents remained standing inside the cord controlling the block of floors.
Any person who has information is requested to send an email to DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, record 247 of 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell of Parliament becomes the last commemorative success for "rewrite history"
Its prohibition would be an act of poetic justice for this Taliban-style destruction of so many cultural and religious objects of England carried out by its fanatic puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestions as a "crazy" and an "intent to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, commented: "In the current debate on the elimination of statues, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell from the Palace of Westminster would become an objective.
The iconoclasy of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
He may sacrifice himself to the wrong Cromwell for the actions of his forefather, Thomas, during the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell is proof of the opinion of the 19th century and of the historiography of a figure that many consider worthy to celebrate.
As Mr Goldsmith pointed out to The Sunday Telegraph: "Many consider Cromwell, perhaps more at the end of the nineteenth century than at present, an advocate of parliament for external pressure, in this case, it is clear, the monarchy.
If this is a completely precise description, it is a matter of continuing the historic debate.
What is true is that the conflict of the mid 17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure representing a face of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebrating and commemorating."
A killer pig attacks a Chinese farmer
A pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwestern China, according to local media.
The man, identified only by his last name "Yuan", was found dead with a sectioned artery and covered in blood near a pit of the Liupanshui market in the province of Guizhou, as reported on Sunday by the South China Morning Post newspaper.
On 30 May 2005, a pig breeder is preparing to inject vaccines into pigs in a pocilga in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
Apparently, he traveled with his cousin from Yunnan's neighboring province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found out that the door of a nearby doorstep was open.
He said there was a big pig with blood in his mouth in the chicken pit.
The forensic examination confirmed that the pig nearly 250 kilos had attacked the cattleman until death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloodied and crushed," the cousin said, addressed by his last name, "Wu," to The Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera images showed Yuan entering the market on Thursday at 4:40 to feed their pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to either Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told The Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent anyone from attacking, while the police collected evidence at the scene.
It seems Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, it's not the first time a pig attacks a person.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their Massachusetts farm, leaving the man wounded with gravity.
Ten years earlier, a pig of nearly 295 kilos ran into a cattleman on his tractor until his wife frightened the animal.
After, in 2012, some pigs were eaten by an Oregon farmer, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "scatter".
"They're just playing.
They're like children, very curious... their intention is not to hurt.
What needs to be done is to have proper respect for them," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will leave heavy rains widespread in the southwest of the United States.
As planned, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the coldest waters of the north coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will leave torrential rains all over northern Mexico and southwest of the USA in the next few days.
Rosa caused wind bursts of more than 136 km/h, a category 1 hurricane, from Sunday to 5 in the morning (East) and was located almost 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, in the Pacific Ocean, low pressures are beginning to arise, moving east towards the West Coast of the U.S. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday, a tropical storm will begin to boost intense tropical rainstorms in the north direction, toward the southwest of the U.S.
Rosa will leave more than 25 centimeters of rain in some areas of Mexico on Monday.
Finally, when the tropical rain strikes with the low pressure that is approaching, there will be heavy rainfall in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, between 2 and 10 centimetres of rain will cause dangerous sudden floods, debris flows and possible landslides in the desert.
The intense tropical rains will cause precipitation of almost 5 to 8 centimeters per hour in concrete areas, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
Between 5 and 10 centimeters of rain are expected in parts of the southwest, especially in most Arizona.
Due to the scattered nature of tropical rains, sudden floods may occur with rapidly worsening conditions.
Because of this threat of tropical torrential rains, it is not recommended at all to venture into the desert on foot.
The strong rains could turn the cannons into embraved rivers and the storms would cause cracked winds and dust clouds locally.
The low pressures that are approaching will leave strong rains in concrete parts of the southern coast of California.
The torrential rains may leave up to two centimeters of water, which could cause small debris flows and cause the roads to slip.
It would be the first torrential rains in the region during the wet season.
Some scattered tropical chaparrones will begin to approach Arizona at the last hour of Sunday and the first hour of Monday, before the rain is generalized at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
The strong rains will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and throughout Wednesday.
In October, some intense changes in temperature in the U.S. can be observed due to the cooling of the Arctic and the warmth of the tropics.
Sometimes, this involves drastic changes in temperature in short distances.
A good example of these temperature differences is what will happen throughout the U.S. center on Sunday.
There will be a difference of almost 7 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the long summer heat will try to recover and expand again.
In a large part of the center and east of the U.S. it is expected a warm early October, with generalized temperatures that will round the 26 degrees from the South Plain to parts of the north-east.
On Tuesday, in New York, temperatures of up to 26 degrees, about 12 degrees above average could be reached.
Our long-term forecast indicates high probability of temperatures above the average for the east of the USA during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people saw the appearance of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people followed the tearing testimonies that Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault allegedly occurred in the 1980s, gave Thursday in six television stations.
Meanwhile, politics continued in a dead end and the media interrupted their regular programming to retransmit the latest news on Friday: an agreement designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Blake to conduct an investigation into the allegations for a week.
Ford informed the Senate Judicial Commission that he is absolutely certain that Kavanaugh touched her in a state of drunkenness and that he tried to take her clothes out at an institute party.
During his passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said he was absolutely certain that that had not happened.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people commenting on Nielsen on Friday have seen it.
The company accounted for the average audience at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other channels that broadcast it, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some problems calculating how many people see something in the office.
To put it in perspective, it is a similar audience to that of an American football match from the playoffs or the Oscar awards.
Fox News Channel, whose tertullians have strongly supported the designation of Kavanaugh, fuel the leading channel, with an average of 5.69 million spectators during a appearance that lasted all day, said Nielsen.
ABC ranked second, with 3.26 million spectators.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, said Nielsen.
After the appearance, great interest continued to be shown.
Flake was the central character of Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement informing that it would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, on Friday morning CNN and CBS cameras captured how protesters screamed at him when he tried to get an elevator to attend a court hearing.
While receiving these complaints, broadcast live by CNN, he was killed.
"Looking at my face," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?"
And he went on, "You have power when there are so many women who don't."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and, before the elevator doors were closed, he would tell the Commission more about their appearance.
It was broadcast live by cable and broadcast television stations hours later, when the Judicial Commission had to vote to propose Kavanaugh's candidacy to the Senate for voting.
However, Flake said that he would only do so if the FBI were investigating charges against the candidate during the next week, which they had been asking for some Democrats.
Flake was convinced, partly by the conversations he had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was fundamental, as it was clear that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without that investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "making politics" with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics with her plan to leave the European Union of "making politics" with Britain's future and of undermining national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives Congress of the Conservative Party to be held in Birmingham, Great Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with her on the cover of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson, insisted on her attack on Chequers' so-called plan for brexit, stating that a proposal for Britain and the EU to charge the other's tariffs was "totally absurd."
Wayde's murder: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson as a suspect of LSU player's death
Police arrested a suspect for the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from LSU, during a shooting.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and imprisoned by a second-degree homicide charge, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police report that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered the glasses at the scene of the crime and said they had found Simpson's DNA in them, according to WAFB, branch of the CBS.
After interviewing Simpson, the police say he admitted shooting Wayde.
A bond of $350,000 has been established, according to the defence.
The Instruction Judge of Baton Rouge District This published a preliminary report on Friday indicating that the cause of death had been a bullet wound in the neck that had come to the head.
The department recognizes the merits of the fugitive unit of the Louisiana State Police, the criminalistic laboratory of the State Police, the Southern University police and citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU's sports director, thanked the local police for his "diligence and search for justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The player, who was more than two metres tall, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball in LSU.
He had obtained an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in a game of the last season.
Friday morning, Will Wade, LSU basketball coach, declared that his team is "devasted" and "in shock" for Wayde's death.
"These are the things people always care about," Wade said.
A ash-dropping volcano in Mexico City
Ceniza from the Volcano Popocatepetl has arrived in the neighborhoods south of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the crater showed activity and recorded 183 gas emissions and ash in 24 hours.
The center recorded several tremors and shakings.
On social media, the images showed thin layers of ash covering the windshields of vehicles in neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilc.
Geophysics have observed a greater activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometers south-east of the capital, since an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 struck the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police face Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested on Saturday in Barcelona after independent protestors faced riots while thousands of people participated in opposition demonstrations coinciding with the first anniversary of the polarized Catalonia referendum on secession.
A group of capped separatists to whom the rioters had cut the pass threw eggs and powder painting, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets, which are usually filled with tourists.
There were also clashes in subsequent hours, and the police used to contain the fight.
For several hours, the independentist groups, with messages such as "not forgetting nor forgiveness", faced unionist protesters with the cry of "Viva España".
Fourteen people were treated for mild injuries during the protests, according to local media.
Tensions continue to be high in this region one year after the vote on 1 October, considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The voters elected independence by overwhelming majority, although participation was low, as those who were against the secession boycotted the referendum to a large extent.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police attempted to prevent voting at electoral tables throughout the region, where violent clashes occurred.
Groups for independence encamped Friday night to avoid a demonstration of support for the National Police.
The demonstration continued, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who was attending the separatist protest with his wife, said that he no longer had hopes of independence from Catalonia.
"Last year we lived one of our best moments.
I saw my parents weeping with joy for being able to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite a vital, though narrow victory, in the regional elections of last December, pro-Catalanist parties have struggled to retain momentum this year, as many of their best-known leaders, whether in self-imposed exile or detained, are awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, who recorded the protest in support of the police on his phone, said that the conflict had been fuelled by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced that he would participate in next year's European Parliament elections.
"To be a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish Government," he said.
Londonderry: men arrested for ambushing a house with a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after repeatedly ambushing a Londonderry house with a car.
The incident took place on Thursday around 7.30 p.m. in Ballinagard Crescent.
Inspector Bob Blemmings commented that damage was done to the accesses and the building itself.
At some point, he may have shot himself in the car with a crossbow.
A Menga attack grants 1-0 victory to Livingston against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
A sponsored Livingston impressed the Rangers by achieving the second defeat for Steven Gerrard in 18 matches as coach of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's attack made a difference. Gary Holt's went up a post with the Hibernian in second place.
This season, Gerrard's have not yet won a win out of the house and next Sunday they face Hearts, leader of the board with eight points of advantage.
Before, the Rangers receive the Rapid Vienna on Thursday at the Europa League.
Meanwhile, Livingston expands its winning streak in the six-game division. Holt, the incumbent coach, has not yet tasted defeat since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston lets opportunities pass in front of a blunt visitor
Holt's team had to have gone one step ahead long before marking, causing all sorts of problems to the Rangers for their direct game.
Scott Robinson overcame the defense, but failed his attempt in front of the carrier. Later, Alan Lithgow was fired from the detour after he was admitted to the house to finish Craig Halkett's head centre in front of the carrier.
The host team was happy to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause problems for visitors with standing ball games.
That's how the decisive goal came.
The Rangers gave them a free shot and Livingston looked for an entry, with a combined play by Declan Gallagher and Robinson for Menga, who hit the ball and marked from the center of the area.
At that time, the Rangers dominated the possession, but they could not pass the defense of the host and the porter, Liam Kelly, was quite quiet.
That game continued until the second part, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to stop.
Allan McGregor, porter of the Rangers rejected a shot by Scott Pittman of a kick, and Lithgow stayed away from another play of Livingston.
In the Livingston area, there were constantly long passes, but they were always cleared. Two penalty requests were rejected, one after a Halkett entry over the alternate Glenn Middleton and the other by one hand.
Livingston's "phenomenal" (analysis)
Alasdair BBC Lamont Scotland at Tony Macaroni Stadium
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
The unanimous opinion is that they made an excellent game that continued to surpass the expectations of an ascending trajectory.
His style of play and his staff have hardly experienced changes since his ascent, but this is largely due to Holt by the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Halkett, the team captain, was huge and led a magnificently organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall alert at all times.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they had very good times with Gerrard, they were short.
They lacked materialization of the plays, as they only managed to enter the opposite field once, which is a call for attention to the Rangers, which are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received an ambiguous reception in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, there were smiles and a blue sky during the breakfast of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, with the aim of re-establishing relations between NATO allies.
They discussed issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to inaugurate a huge new mosque.
The city welcomes the largest population of Turks outside Turkey.
The police claimed security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from meeting in front of the mosque, but many sympathizers met in the immediate vicinity to see their president.
Hundreds of opponents of Erdogan, many of them Kurds, were also heard, condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to receive it in the country.
These demonstrations reflect how divisive this visitor is, received as a hero by some German Turks and considered an autocrat by others.
Traffic accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies after colliding with a vehicle
A cyclist died in a car accident in London.
The accident occurred near the crossing of Bestwookd Street and Evelyn Street, a crowded road from Deptford, south-east of the city, around 10:15.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was taken care of by the paramedics, but died there.
The accident occurred after another cyclist died after being hit by a vehicle that escaped on Childers Street, almost two kilometres from the site of the Saturday accident.
The Metropolitan Police said the officers were working to identify the man and inform his family.
Roads have been cut off and buses diverted, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six wounded agents after riots
Six prison officers have been injured in an altercation in a high-security prison for men, according to the Correctional Office.
The riots began at Long Lartin Prison, Worcestershire, around 9:30 a.m. on Sunday and still continue.
Specialists from an elite team (called "Return") are in charge of controlling the altercations, in which eight inmates participate and affect a pavilion.
The officers were assisted by mild lesions on the face at the site.
A prison spokesman commented: "Specialized prison personnel have been deployed to deal with the ongoing incident at Long Lartin Prison.
Six staff members have received health care for injuries.
In our prisons violence is not tolerated and we make it clear that those responsible will be put in the hands of the police and could spend more time in prison."
The Long Lartin prison is home to more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had received hospital medical assistance after a prisoner attacked him.
In addition, in October of last year, riot officers were requested to go to prison to deal with a serious altercation in which prison personnel were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (arid areas could benefit)
It is unusual for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that is exactly what could happen at the beginning of the week when the latest collections of Hurricane Rosa passed through the southwest of the desert, with the risk of sudden floods.
The National Meteorology Service has already issued sudden flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in west Arizona, south and east Nevada and southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, leaving rains at the end of Monday.
The Phoenix National Meteorology Service commented on a tweet that only "ten hurricanes had preserved their tropical storm or depression in a radio station of 321 kilometres from Phoenix since 1950.
In 1967, Hurricane Katrina approached nearly 65 kilometres from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Centre foresee between 5 and 10 centimeters of torrential rains, which can reach 15 centimeters in isolated areas of the Mogolón Escarpe in Arizona.
It is likely to fall between 2 and 5 centimeters of rain, with the possibility of reaching 10 in isolated places, in other areas of the southwest of the desert, including the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin.
In places where there is no risk of sudden floods, Rosa's rains can be considered a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although a flood is a very serious issue, some of these torrential rains are likely to be beneficial due to the drought conditions currently being experienced in the southwest.
According to the United States Drought Monitor, more than 40% of Arizona is suffering, at least, from extreme drought, the second highest category, as reported atweather.com.
First, the route of Hurricane Rosa will hit Mexico's Baja California Peninsula.
Rosa, which on Sunday morning will still have a hurricane force with maximum bursts of 136 kilometers per hour, is 619 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and moves north 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, so it is losing strength.
Thus, it is expected to fall into Mexico with the intensity of a tropical storm during the afternoon of Monday.
Strong torrential rains could fall in some parts of Mexico, which are at considerable risk of flooding.
"Tornal rains between 7 and 15 centimeters are expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with the possibility of reaching 25 centimeters", as reported atweather.com.
After that, Rosa will head north of Mexico as a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression. Later, she will travel through Arizona to southern Utah at the last hour of Tuesday night.
"The main danger of Rosa or her remains is the strong torrential rain in Baja California, the northwest of Sonora and the southwest of the U.S. desert," says Hurricane National Center.
These rains are expected to cause dangerous sudden floods and debris flows in the deserts, as well as landslides in mountain areas.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old have been arrested as suspects of an attempted murder after another 16-year-old girl was found with white gunshot wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton around 4:00 p.m. on Saturday.
He was moved to a hospital, where he remains "stable".
One 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and one 20-year-old were arrested that same night in Radstock, Avon, according to Somerset Police.
Agents have appealed to anyone who may have recorded what happened with the mobile phone.
Trump says that Kavanaugh "suffered the pettyness and anger" of the Democratic Party
"Voting in favor of Judge Kavanaugh is voting to reject the ruthless and indignant tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting held in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has "suffered the pettyness and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the appointment process.
Kavanaugh testified to Congress on Thursday, denying in a strong and emotional way the accusation by Christine Blasey Ford that she had been sexually assaulted decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the meeting on this charge.
On Saturday, the president said that, that day, the "Americans saw Kavanaugh's cunning, quality and courage."
"Voting to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is voting to confirm one of the legalists with more achievements today, a lawyer with an admirable record at the service of the public," he told his supporters in West Virginia.
The President made indirect references to the candidacy of Kavanaugh in talking about the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
"There are five weeks left for one of the most important choices in our lives.
I don't introduce myself, but it's a career," he said.
"That's why I'm going from place to place fighting to get great candidates."
Trump claimed that the Democrats are engaged in a mission of "resistance and obstruction."
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh is expected to take place no later than Friday, a high-ranking position of the Republican Party's leadership was reported to the CNN.
Hundreds of deaths in an earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, the figure is increasing
At least 384 people have died and many have been dragged by the huge waves that flooded the beaches after a strong earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, as reported on Saturday by the authorities.
Hundreds of people had gathered to celebrate a festival on the beach of the city of Palu on Friday when waves of up to six metres reached the coast at dusk, dragging many to death and destroying everything in its path.
The tsunami occurred after an earthquake of 7.5 magnitude.
"When he warned yesterday that a tsunami could occur, people were still on the beach and didn't immediately flee, so they were victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the National Agency for Catastrophe Management (BNPB), Indonesia, on a press conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not arrive alone, dragged cars, logs, houses, hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said. The tsunami had moved through the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
He also added that some people had climbed the trees to escape the tsunami and survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The aerial photographs published by the agency showed the destruction of many buildings and shops, broken and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The replicas continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake series was felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
The Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) reported in a statement that the energy released by the big Friday earthquake was 200 times higher than that of the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima in World War II.
He added that the geography of the city, which sits at the end of a long and narrow bay, could have magnified the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "important" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had collapsed.
According to him, bodies were found of some victims trapped under the rubble of the collapsed buildings. In addition, 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho noted that the number of victims and the damage could be greater along the 300 km of coast north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications "were totally paralyzed and there was no information" of Donggala, Nugroho commented.
"There live more than 300,000 people," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy of itself, but it could be much worse," he said.
On Saturday, the agency received many criticisms not to report that a tsunami had hit Palu, although those responsible claimed that the waves had already reached the coast when the alert was issued.
In a recording taken by a social media fan, one hears a man who was on the top floor of a building telling people that he was on the street that a tsunami was coming.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the coast, leading buildings and cars.
Reuters could not validate the material immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a huge blackout that cut off communications around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue work.
The army began sending cargo planes with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities declare, but the evacuees still need food and other commodities.
The city airport has been reopened for relief purposes only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has a scheduled visit to Paul's evacuation centres on Sunday.
The number of victims for the tsunami in Indonesia is over 800.
It's a very bad thing.
Although Donggala's World Vision staff have arrived safely and safely in the city of Palu, where the employees take refuge under canvases installed in the garden of their offices, they have seen a devastating panorama on their way, said Mr Doseva.
"They told me that they had seen many destroyed houses," he said.
It's a very bad thing.
Even while aid groups launched the gears of disaster assistance, some people regretted that the displacement of experienced co-workers to Palu was not being allowed.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and staffing of foreign personnel can only be used if the site is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a provincial disaster," said Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
"As soon as the Government says it considers it a national disaster, we can start providing international aid, but it has not yet happened."
When the second night fell in Palu after the earthquake and the Friday tsunami, friends and family of the people who were still missing had the hope that their loved ones would be the miracles that brought some light to the desolating stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken from a sewer.
On Sunday, the rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped under rubble for two days next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, instructor of the Indonesian National Paragliding Team, had formed two of the missing parapentists for the Asian Games, which ended earlier that month in Indonesia.
Others who were trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"Because of my experience in the paragliding field, I carry my own emotional burden," he commented.
Mr Gendon recalled how, in the hours following the release of the news that the Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed in the paragliding community, he had sent desperate messages from WhatsApp to the Palu competitors, who participated in the festival on the beach.
However, their messages only showed a check mark in grey, not two in blue.
"I think that means the messages weren't delivered," he said.
Thieves take 26 750 USD during a recharge of an automatic cashier in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, robbers attacked a Brink employee who was reloading an ATM at Newport on the Levee, bringing US$26,750, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied an ATM located in the center of leisure and was preparing to recharge it with more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the note.
While he was busy, another man "went near running behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money destined for the recharge.
According to the note, there were witnesses who saw several suspects leaving the place, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identities must contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes his name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West will start calling Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday: "The person previously known as Kanye West".
A long time ago, 41-year-old West was nicknamed Ye, a name he used as a title for his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before its appearance on Saturday Night Live, where it is expected to present its new album, Yandhi.
It replaces the singer Ariana Grande, who had to cancel her performance for "emotional reasons", as the program's creator commented.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had previously said that the word was of religious importance to him.
"I think it's the most used word in the Bible, where it means 'you'," West said earlier this year as he talked about the album's title with the radio speaker Big Boy.
"It's you, it's us, it means us.
It happened to be Kanye, which means ‘the only one’, to Ye, a reflection of our good, bad and confused things, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are."
He's one of the many famous rappers who's changed his name.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced he preferred Love and Brother Love names.
A former West collaborator, JAY-Z, has used his name in upper or lower case, with or without script.
Mexican AMLO promises not to use the army against the civilian population
Andrés Manuel López Obrador, Mexican President-elect, has promised never to use the army against the civilian population, now that the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students in the country is approaching.
On Saturday, López Obrador promised in Plaza Tlatelolco that "he would never use the army to suppress the people of Mexico."
On 2 October 1968, the troops fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people at a time when the left-wing student movements were building up throughout Latin America.
López Obrador is committed to supporting young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to those who study and open up more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities led young people to join criminal gangs.
The US should double funding for I.A.
Now that China is more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its investment in research in this field, says Kai-Fu Lee, I.A.'s investor and professional who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments then emerge from the announcements concerning I.A. of various parts of the US Government, even when, in general, the US lacks an official I.A. strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become the #1 innovation in IA by 2030.
"Duplicate the research budget for I. A. would be a good start, since all the other countries go very far behind America. We have a look at the next advance in the field of I. A.," says Lee.
Double funding means double the chances that the next major achievement in I.A. will be achieved in the U.S., as Lee stated in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by the publishing company Haughton Mifflin Harcourt, is the executive director of Innovation Ventures, who has invested in one of China's most important companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on a system of I.A. that beat the best American player in Othello. Later, he was executive in Microsoft Research and president of Google’s subsidiary in China.
Lee granted recognition to the previous technological competitions of the U.S. government, such as the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when it would be the next one, which would enable the next generation of visionaries to be identified.
In the US, researchers often have to work hard to get government grants, Lee said.
"It's not China that's taking academic leaders; it's corporations," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired leading university staff to work in I.A.
Lee commented that changes in migration policy could also help the U.S. to step up its initiatives in I.A.
"I think doctors in I.A. should have permanent residence cards automatically," he said.
The State Council of China presented its Plan for the Development of the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The Chinese National Natural Sciences Foundation funds people from academic institutions, as does the National Science Foundation and other government organizations, to United States researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee commented.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which aims to attract partners from the industrial and academic fields. For its part, the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month DARPA announced an investment of USD 2000 million in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the National Science Foundation, it currently invests more than USD 100 million per year in research by I. A.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that tried to create a National Commission on Security in Artificial Intelligence has not carried out any action in months.
Macedonians decided in a referendum on whether they are going to change the name of their country
The people of Macedonia decided in a referendum on Sunday whether their name will change to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a gesture that would resolve a decades-old conflict with Greece, which had blocked their candidacy for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim from its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, both Governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents maintained that change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic population, most of them in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has questioned whether the participation will reach the minimum 50% required for the referendum to be considered valid.
The referendum paper raised the following question: "Is it in favour of NATO and EU membership with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is a price worth paying for for Macedonia, one of the countries emerging from the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to try to access bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although it will not be legally binding, many Members of Parliament have said that they will respect the result of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that no irregularities had been reported at one in the afternoon.
However, participation was only 16%, compared to 34% of the last elections to Parliament in 2016, when 66% of registered voters cast their vote.
"I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62-year-old, who voted in the capital Skopje.
Zoran Zaev, prime minister of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko deposited their vote in the Macedonia referendum on a change of name of the country that would open the way to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica (Macedonia) on September 30, 2018.
In front of Parliament, in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavarvarkov prepared a small stage and removed chairs in front of the tents planted by those who were going to boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of entering NATO and the EU, but we want to do it with a very high head, not through the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want us to enter as Macedonia, we can establish relations with other countries, such as China and Russia, and be part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would provide the investment that Macedonia needs so much, with an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I believe that the vast majority will be in favour, as more than 80% of citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after they cast their vote.
He said that a positive outcome would be a "confirmation of our future".
In a survey published last Monday by the Institute of Policy Research, it was ensured that between 30 and 43% of voters were going to participate in the referendum, which is less than the one required.
Another survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia revealed that 57% of respondents had planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said that he would vote in favour.
For the referendum to be considered a success, participation must be 50% plus one vote.
If it fails, it would be the first serious blow to the politics of the pro-Western government since it came to power in May last year.
Look at this: Sergio Agüero from Manchester City, dodging the entire Brighton defense to score a goal
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling reinvented Brighton's defense in the 2-0 victory that Manchester City obtained on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
For Agüero, it was ridiculously easy to score a goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine half-point received a pass in the middle field at the beginning of the play.
He ran between three Brighton defenses before entering open camp.
Once there, he was surrounded by four green T-shirts.
She equated to a defense before overcoming several more on the edge of the Brighton area.
He took a pass to the left, where Sterling was.
The English forwarder used his first touch in the area to return the ball to Agüero, who hit him with his right foot to avoid porter Mathew Ryan with a shot that came to the right side of the network.
"Agüero has some foot problems," said Pep Guardiola, a City coach, to journalists.
"We're talking about playing between 55 and 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at the time."
However, it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League contest.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
In that play, Agüero received the ball very within the Brighton territory.
He made a nice ball pass on the left flank for Leroy Sane.
Sane gave him a few touches before heading towards Sterling to the second pole.
Sky blues front threw the ball to the net just before it got out of bounds.
The City faces Hoffenheim in a group match of the Champions League on Tuesday at 12:55 at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim (Germany).
Scherzer wants the Rockies party.
With the Nationals eliminated from the fight by the playoffs, there was no reason to force another opening.
Even so, the ever competitive Scherzer expects to step on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if these, won in front of Los Angeles Dodgers in the West Division of the National League, still have opportunities in playoffs.
The Rockies secured at least one wildcard post thanks to the 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but still pursue their first division title.
"Although we're not playing anything, at least we can tread the rubber with the certainty that Denver's audience will be excited and that the other team will probably play at the highest level that I've ever faced this year.
Why wouldn't you want to participate?"
The Nationals still have to announce an opener for Sunday, but they seem to be inclined to let Scherzer go in that situation.
Scherzer, who would make his opening number 34, took a practice session on Thursday and will return to his normal rest on Sunday.
Washington's disaster record is 18 wins and 7 defeats, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts with 2/3 in 220 entries.
Trump at a rally in West Virginia
The President made indirect references to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, his selection for the Supreme Court, in talking about the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
"All we've done is at stake in November.
There are five weeks left for one of the most important choices in our lives.
It’s one of the most important. I don’t introduce myself, but it’s a career, so I’m going from place to place fighting for great candidates,” he said.
And he continued: "We have this terrible radical group of Democrats, it's happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by all necessary means, you see pettyness, evil.
They don't care who they do harm or who they have to go through to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control. And we're not going to give it to them."
The Democrats, he said, are engaged in a mission of "resistance and obstruction."
"We've seen him these last four days," he said, saying that the Democrats "were furious, they were evil, horrible and false."
He referred to the Senate Judicial Commission by appointing Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who received the abucheos from the public.
"Remember his answer?
Do you read the document?
Mmm, Mmm, what?
No, no mmm, I hope for an answer. His body language was terrible, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party already encompasses a wide range of opinions.
It's intolerant with people who say what they think.
When Momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I am the last in a row of Members of the Labour Party Parliament who are told not to be welcome, and just to say what we think.
My colleague from Parliament, Joan Ryan, received a treatment that seemed to be categorically against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
I disagreed with the importance of a responsible economic policy, in terms of national security, on Europe. It turns out ironic that they were issues in which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
As stated in the Notice of Friday's Nottingham East Labour Party meeting, "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of the eight years I have been a Member of the Parliament of the Local Labour Party, that is exactly what the evening meetings on Fridays of the General Committee have been.
Unfortunately, this is not the current tone of many meetings and the promise of a "kinder and kinder" policy is already more than forgotten, if it really was applied at some point.
It is becoming increasingly clear that discrepant views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged on the basis of whether or not the party leaders consider it acceptable.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues with whom he previously thought that he shared a similar political vision began to expect him to change his mind radically and to adopt positions that he would never have agreed, whether on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public, regardless of what I say, there are a diatribe of insults on social networks demanding my withdrawal, denouncing the policies of the center, telling me that it should not be in the Labour Party.
I'm not the only one who's experienced it.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments about me tend to be political.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist insults every day, but never run away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of insults.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer have that wide range of opinions and, with each motion "of censure" or every change in the rules of selection, the party becomes narrower.
In the last two years, I've received a lot of advice that recommended me to keep my head down and not make me hear so much and that's how "it'd be okay."
But I didn't get into politics to do that.
Since 32 years ago I joined the Labour Party as a high school student, motivated by the neglect of Thatcher's government that left my whole school classroom literally in ruins, I have tried to support the improvement of public services for those who need them most, either as a councillor or as a government minister.
I have never hidden my political ideas, nor in the last elections.
It is impossible for anyone in Nottingham East to be unaware of my political positions or areas in which I disagreed with current leaders.
The only thing I would say to those who promoted Friday's motion is that I don't understand this desire to waste time and energy with questions about my loyalty to the Labour Party leader when the country heads a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and public services.
The real message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for the electors, whether from the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve them and I promise that no threat of withdrawal or political opportunism will prevent me from acting according to what I think is best for all of you.

Ayr 38 - Melrose 17: An indicted Ayr climbs to the top
Two essays at the end of the party may have decided to some extent the final result, but certainly, Ayr deserved victory in this very entertaining party of the Tennent's Premiership day.
Now they're heading the table and it's the only indicted team of the ten participating.
In the end, it was the superiority of his defense, as well as his ability to take better advantage of the opportunities, which gave the victory to the local team, so coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
"We've been tested in all the parties and we're still indicted, so I have to be glad," he said.
Robyn Christie of the Melrose commented: "The Ayr deserves recognition, they took advantage of opportunities better than us."
Grant Anderson's essay in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, placed the Ayr ahead; but a yellow card to Scottish captain Rory Hughes, the Warriors' loan to the party, allowed Melrose to take advantage of this disadvantage of the opponent and Jason Baggot got an unconverted essay.
Climo extended the advantage of the Ayr with a penalty. Before, just in the middle of the time, he marked and turned a solo trial, which left the marker in 17-5 in favor of the Ayr at rest.
However, the Melrose started the second part well and Patrick Anderson's essay, converted by Baggot, reduced this difference to five points.
Then there was a long interruption due to a serious injury by Ruaridh Knott, to which they had to pull out on a stretcher, and, upon resumption of the match, the Ayr went ahead with a essay by Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
The yellow card to Blair Macpherson, captain of the Ayr, allowed Melrose to retake that they had one more man with an unconverted trial of Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of enormous pressure.
However, the premises recovered and, when the yellow card was shown to Struan Hutchinson for placing Climo without the ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson did a rehearsal when he was in the back of the maul that was advancing.
Climo converted it, just as he had been doing almost since the game resumed, after Kyle Rowe received the ball sent by David Armstrong from a kick and sent to the wing Gregor Henry to the bottom to do the fifth rehearsal of the premises.
Still Game's protagonist wants to direct his career towards the restoration sector
Ford Kieran, protagonist of Still Game, seems determined to move into the catering sector after revealing that he has been appointed director of a chain of restaurants.
The 56-year-old actor is Jack Jarvis in the BBC's famous show, who writes and co-stars with his comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the ninth season will be the last in the series, and it seems Kiernan is making plans for his life after Craiglang.
According to the official record, he is director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the matter, although a source of the Scottish Sun pointed out that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the "florent restoration market" of Glasgow.
"The sea belongs to us": a landlocked Bolivia has the hope that the court will reopen the route to the Pacific
The sailors are guarding a naval headquarters in La Paz.
In public buildings, they wave sea blue flags.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the naval bases show the motto: "The sea belongs to us by right,
It's a duty to get it back."
Throughout Bolivia, a land without sea, they still vividly remember the coast lost before Chile in a bloody conflict over the resources that took place in the 19th century, in addition to the longing to sail back through the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may be the greatest in decades, as Bolivia expects a resolution of the International Court of Justice by 1 October, after five years of discussion.
"Bolivia has the impulse, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, is waiting for the result with a positive vision," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will observe the ruling of the International Court of Justice on large screens distributed throughout the country, in the hope that the Hague court will rule in favor of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile has an obligation to negotiate to grant Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who wages a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has much to say about the resolution of Monday.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court would decide in favor of Bolivia and that the situation would change little if it did.
The United Nations agency based in the Netherlands has no authority to award Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice resolution arrives only six months after the final allegations indicates that the case "was not complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
Far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, it may have been hindered in the last four years.
"The problem of access to the sea has been kidnapped by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
In addition, he suggested that Morales' belligerent rhetoric has undermined any residual Chilean goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold conversations after this.
Both countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that court decision-making was unusually rapid.
On Monday, Bolivia will be offered "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and the possibility of "ending 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, used the maritime issue as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up her right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The resolution is an opportunity to see that we have to leave the past behind."
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless you can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never be the first to bring nuclear disarmament to an end if it cannot trust Washington.
He spoke to the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to deliver on the promises made during a Singapore summit among rival leaders.
His comments come at a time when Mike Pompeo, U.S. Secretary of State, seems to be about to resume diplomatic nuclear talks paralyzed more than three months after this summit with North Korea's leader Kim Jong U.
Ri points out that the continuation of continued sanctions and US opposition to a declaration ending the Korean War to submit to the north is a "quimer".
Washington is reluctant to accept the statement without Pyongyang making any significant disarmament movement earlier.
Both Kim and the US president, Donald Trump, want to hold another summit.
However, there is widespread scepticism about Pyongyang's seriousness of renouncing an arsenal that the country probably regards as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare another summit among the leaders.
Paris fashion shows reveal the last line of huge hats that are about to land on a shopping street near you
If you want to increase your hat collection or fully protect from the sun, don't look any further.
Valentino and Thom Browne designers presented an eccentric set of large hats for their spring summer 2019 collection on the gateway, dazzling the style of the Paris Fashion Week.
Impossible hats have flooded Instagram this summer and these designers have brought their spectacular creations to the gateway.
Valentino's most outstanding piece was a beige hat with a wide wing adorned with feathers that wrapped the heads of the models.
Other large add-ons were jewelry sandwiches, a witch hat and even a pineapple, but are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of amazing masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and remembered Hannibal Lecter more than the high seas.
One creation reminded a full diving team, snorkelling and glasses included, while another looked like a melted ice cream cone.
If you like big fashion, you're lucky.
The style hunters predict that huge hats could start to look at the streets of shops.
The big hats come standing strong by hand from "La Bomba", with a straw hat with a wing of more than 60 cm used by all, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind this so impractical hat that flooded social networks presented another great creation on the gateway: a straw beach bag as large as the bathing model that wore it.
The bag of dark orange raffia, decorated with branches of raffia and with a white leather handle, was the main piece of the collection La Riviera de Jacquemus for the spring-summer season 2019 in the Paris Fashion Week.
As the famous designer Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "Next summer, I hope to see huge beach hats and bags on commercial streets. Since the designer has had a big impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large additions."
John Edward: Language skills are key to the citizens of the world
Scotland's independent educational centers have a history of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another set of extraordinary results in the exams that are reinforced by individual and collective successes harvested in the fields of sport, art, music and other community projects.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these centres, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Colleges (SCIS, for their acronyms in English), strive to deliver the best level of service to students and parents.
The aim of the independent schools is to prepare their students to continue their higher education studies, to the career they choose and to the place they occupy as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement an adapted curriculum, it is observed that modern languages remain a popular and desired subject in the centers.
As Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, the message comes to his head.
If you speak to him in his tongue, he comes to his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that if you want to build relationships and build trust with people from other countries, you cannot rely solely on English.
If we take into account the recent results of this year's exams, we can observe that the languages are at the top of the classification tables, being the highest approved rates in the independent schools.
In total, 68% of students who studied foreign languages obtained an A, the highest grade.
The data collected from the 74 centres that are part of the SCIS showed that 72% of students obtained an A in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish also obtained an A.
This shows that Scotland's independent schools support foreign languages by considering them a fundamental competence that both children and young people will certainly need in the future.
At present, it is considered that, as a subject, languages are at the same level as CTIM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and everywhere.
A survey carried out in 2014 by the UK Employment and Competence Commission revealed that, of the reasons given by employers about the difficulties they encountered in filling jobs, 17 % were attributed to the lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly indispensable in preparing young people for their future careers.
Possible job opportunities that require languages are increasing, so these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career someone chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future thanks to a competition like this, which will last his whole life.
Being able to communicate directly with persons from foreign countries will allow that person to automatically advance to competition.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov among more than 4000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75% of them did not speak any foreign language well enough to maintain a conversation, and it was also established that the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15%, was French.
For this reason, investing in language teaching is now important for children today.
If they know several languages, especially those of developing economies, children will be equipped to have better opportunities to find quality employment.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some centres will focus on the most classical modern languages, while others will teach the languages considered most important for the United Kingdom by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of a child, in independent schools, you can always choose from a number of languages provided by specialized teaching staff in this field.
Scotland's independent educational centres devote all their efforts to providing a learning environment that prepares children and that teams with the skills necessary to succeed, whatever the future holds them.
At present, it is undeniable that, in a global business environment, languages continue to be of vital importance to the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "competence for international communication".
Independent schools will continue to offer these options, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
We have to do this.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Colleges
LeBron debut with Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The waiting of fans waiting to see LeBron James debut in his first match with Los Angeles Lakers is about to finish.
Luke Walton, a Lakers coach, has announced that James will play the opening game of the pre-season to be held on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it remains to be determined how many minutes it will take to play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the official Lakers website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell posted on a tweet that James was likely to play for a limited few minutes.
After a training session earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the pre-season program of six Lakers games.
"At this stage of my career I don't need pre-season games to prepare myself," he said.
Trump's Fun Time in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump starts a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of the five Trump scheduled rallies for the next week, including stops at locations with supporters such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote of his candidate to fill the vacancy of the pending Supreme Court, Trump seeks support for the upcoming mid-term elections, as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress when the votes are deposited in November.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how can you see it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can view it online through a live YouTube broadcast.
Trump is likely to comment on this week's appearances of the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, who was strained by allegations of inappropriate sexual conduct and has been awaiting an early vote of confirmation by the Senate for, at least, a week while the FBI is investigating them.
However, the main objective of this series of rallies is to help Republicans who are facing the November elections take the lead.
Thus, President Trump's campaign noted that the five next week's rallies aim to "animate volunteers and supporters while Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives," Reuters said.
"Congress control is so crucial to your agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we go into the campaign," a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters that he did not want to give his name.
Scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena Stadium Wheeling tonight's rally could attract supporters of "Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as have media coverage of Pittsburgh," as reported by the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month Trump visits West Virginia, the state he won for more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, who is falling behind the polls.
"For Morrisey it's not a good sign that the president has to come and give him a push in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows that they dare to fight to keep alive hope for the individual Sunday parties.
After three individual sessions, it may be the foursomes on Saturday afternoon that this Ryder Cup needed.
The impulse oscillating pendulum is a completely invented sport concept, but players really believe in it, even more in competitions like these.
So where would they say the impulse is now?
"They took us six points of advantage and now they're taking us four, so I guess that can be considered a small boost," said Jordan Spieth at the end of the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course: four points ahead with twelve more in play.
As Spieth points out, Americans feel that they have some wind in favor and reasons to be excited, among other reasons for the couple formed by Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and got three points of four each.
Spieth has been lethal from tea to green and preach with the example.
The celebration Gutural screams rose in volume as his round progressed, introducing a vital putt to tie the fourth match when he and Thomas went down two after two holes.
The putt who gave them the party in the 15 was received with a similar cry, from those who transmit that he believes that the American team has not yet left out.
"What needs to be redoubled and focused on the party," said Spieth.
That's what these players have done.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
The strange and adorable couple in Europe has four of four and nothing can go wrong with them.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who did not make a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided the bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That crack and the way in which its energy flows with the bustling public make it clear that these are the players to be won on Sunday, and that there will be no other players as popular as Fleetwood and Molinari to seal a possible European victory when the sun is put in Le Golf National.
Preferably, both at the same time in different holes.
Even so, it remains premature to talk about European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson sent Sergio García, the hero of the four morning balls, after forming a partner with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes buried the Spanish and Swedish in a hole they couldn't get out of.
But on Sunday there will be no help to get out of the holes.
Fourballs and foursomes are fascinating to see them closely because they appreciate the interactions between couples, the advice they give and the advice they don't give, and the way a strategy can change in an instant.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and has brought a great advantage to the last day, but this session of foursomes has also shown that the U.S. team dares to fight, something that some, especially the Americans, doubted.
Europe is ahead for 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe leaves with a good advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup, after finishing the fourballs and foursomes with a result of 10-6 on the United States.
The motivated duo made up of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the contest with two victories over a Tiger Woods that was seen in trouble, ahead of four points in the Le Golf National ranking.
The European Thomas Bjorn, trying to preserve the trophy that they lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team that made many mistakes during the morning fourballs, which ended 3-1.
The US offered more resistance in the foursomes, winning two matches, but could not shorten distances.
The American Jim Furyk needs to get eight points from the 12 individual games on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novice to win four consecutive points. In addition, he and Molinari, who received the nickname of "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points in their first four matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the furballs, his magnificent union served to defeat an discouraged Woods and the American rookie Bryson Decahmbeau for a round 5-4.
Woods, who in the two games on Saturday had not highlighted too much, had occasional moments of brilliance, but now has lost 19 of his 29 games of four and foursomes, and seven consecutives.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the morning furballs, became Henrik Stenson's partner in the foursomes, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, number one and number three of the world respectively, with a result 2-1.
Although the day was pleasant and quiet in the southwest of Paris, Europe did not have everything on its side.
The three-time winner, Jordan Spieth, and Justin Thomas served as a reference to the Americans, getting two points on Saturday.
They won a passionate 2-1 victory at the Ian Poulter and Spanish Jon Rahm in the fourballs and then defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy for 4-3 in the foursomes after losing the two initial holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, that a team recovers from a four-point difference in individual parties has only happened on two occasions, although Furyk, as the trophy holder, only needs a tie to keep it.
Although they have been the best seconds for two days, it seems that carrying out a counterattack on Sunday is beyond their possibilities.
North Korea says that "there's no chance" of unilateral disarmament first if they don't have confidence
On Saturday, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea informed the United Nations that the continuation of sanctions deepened his mistrust in the United States and that there was no possibility that his country would unilaterally renounce nuclear weapons under these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho declared before the annual General Assembly of the international agency that North Korea had adopted "important measures of goodwill" over the past year, such as the cessation of nuclear and missile testing, the dismantling of nuclear testing facilities and the commitment to nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear technology.
"However, we did not receive any similar response from the United States," he said.
"If we do not have confidence in the United States, we cannot have confidence in our national security, and in those circumstances there is no possibility that we might first disarm unilaterally."
Although Ri repeated the well-known complaints from North Korea about Washington's resistance to a phased denuclearization formula that rewards the country as it takes steps, his statement is important, as he did not simply reject unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong One and Donald Trump following the first summit between an active US president and a North Korean leader on 12 June in Singapore, when Kim pledged to work for the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" and Trump guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea has pursued the official end of the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first renounce its nuclear weaponry.
Washington has also resisted calls for the smoothing of international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States has insisted on denuclearization in the first place and has increased pressure through sanctions in order to achieve its purpose in a coercive manner, even by raising objections to a declaration of termination of the war," Ri said.
"The idea that sanctions can make us fall on our knees is a chimera of people who don't know us.
The problem is that the continuation of sanctions deepens our mistrust."
Ri made no mention of the plans of a second summit between Kim and Trump, announced by the US leader at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae, South Korea's leader, in the last five months, and added: "If South Korea had been an interested part in denuclearization instead of the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be found in such a stagnation."
Even so, the tone of Ri's speech was radically different from last year's speech, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to direct North Korea's missiles to U.S. soil after the "malign president" Trump, on a suicide mission, called Kim " rocket man".
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to "fully destroy" North Korea last year, praised Kim for his courage in advancing disarmament, but said that much remained to be done and that it was necessary to continue applying sanctions until North Korea became denuclear.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no deadline for this: "We can take two years, three years or five months, no matter."
China and Russia allege that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its progress.
However, as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The imposition of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue forcefully and without non-compliance until we realize the ultimate and fully verified denuclearization."
The Security Council has unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006, in an attempt to cut funding for Pyongyang ballistic and nuclear missile programmes.
Pompeo spoke with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and later commented that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had taken place, but, a few hours later, North Korea reported that his "requirements were those of a mobster."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea undertook to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States applied the "measures concerned".
He said Kim had told him that the "proper measures" he was looking for were the security assurances Trump had promised in Singapore and steps towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to rest enough
Thanks to a new course that is being taught this year at Harvard University, all university students sleep more in an attempt to fight the growing machista culture of studying all night drinking caffeine.
One professor found that students at the number one university in the world often have no idea about the basic care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard School of Medicine, and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital designed the course, it is believed that the first of his class in the U.S.
His motivation for starting the course arose after giving a talk about how sleep deprivation affects learning.
"At the end of the course, a girl came up and asked me why she just found out about this now, in her last year.
He said no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, first taught this year, explains to students the basic concepts of how good sleep habits contribute to academic and sports performance, as well as improving general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard School of Medicine and executive director of the health services of the university, noted that the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that the students barely slept during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is an image of a bedroom, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes and books that inform them of the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on sports performance and the importance of establishing a routine to go to sleep.
In another section, participants are informed how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, embolism, depression, and cancer.
A campus icon with interactive icons then encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
"We know it's not going to change students' behavior instantly.
However, we believe that they have a right to know, just like anyone else has a right to know the effects on the health of smoking tobacco," added Professor Czeisler.
He said that the culture of pride for "sleep night" still exists and added that modern technology and the increasing pressure students are subjected to meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Sleeping long enough and a dream of good quality should be the "secret weapon" of students to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety; even to avoid gaining weight, since sleep deprivation causes the brain to generate a feeling of hunger, that's why they want to eat all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes the previous year during his first year at Harvard.
He pointed out that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to expand it to the entire campus.
He hoped that the next step would be to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar curriculum before joining the competitive institution.
The recommendation of Professor Czeisler is that students think of setting an alarm to go to bed and another to wake up, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" that emit the screens of electrical devices and LEDs, which can alter the circadian rhythms, so they would end up having trouble sleeping.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga's goal graves Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another episode of depression outside the house, when Dolly Menga's attack banished Steven Gerrard's disarticulated team from a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The Ibrox wanted to win their first out-of-home victory since the 4-1 of February in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team defeated Gerard's for the second time in 18 matches as a coach, leaving his team at eight points from the Hearts, unbridled leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
The Menga attack took place, it felt minutes before half the time, and the uninspired alignment of the Rangers was not up to it at any time.
Now, the Rangers go down to the sixth position, Livingston goes up to the third, behind the Hibernian due to the difference in goals.
The Rangers may have more problems, as the Calum Spence online judge had to receive medical assistance for a head injury after, supposedly, someone threw an object from the visiting background.
Gerrard switched to eight of the headlines who won the match against the Ayr, entering the semifinals of the Scotland League Cup.
For his part, Holt pulled out the 11 players from Livingston who started a point at Hearts last week and would have been glad of the way his highly organized team drowned the opponents at all times.
The Rangers may have had more possession, but Livingston took better advantage of the ball when he had it.
They should have scored at the beginning of the two minutes, when Menga took a space pass for Scott Pittman who passed between the defense, leaving him alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder sent her out.
Keaghan Jacobs took out a deep flaw for Captain Craig Halket, but his partner in the defense, Alan Lithgow, could only send her out by the long stick.
The Rangers regained control, but it seemed that there were more hopes than conviction about their game in the last third.
Undoubtedly Alfredo Morelos felt that he had been penalized in the 15th minute of the match, when he and Steven Lawless clashed, but the referee Steven Thomson heard deaf ears at the Colombian petition.
The Rangers got two shots to carry in the first half, but the old porter of Ibrox, Liam Kelly, hardly saw himself in trouble to deal with the head of Lassana Coulibaly and the boring launch of Ovie Ejaria.
Although the goal marked in minute 34 by Livingston came against all odds, no one can deny that they deserved it for the dedicated effort.
Again, the Rangers were unable to cope with a deep, stationary ball play by Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher put the ball in place for Scott Robinson, who kept calm and passed it to Menga to score the goal.
At rest, Gerard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, which had an impact almost immediately, as the steering wheel passed it to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out of his line to block him.
Even so, Livingston continued to take visitors exactly to the kind of game he likes, with Lithgow and Halkett taking a long pass after another.
Holt's could have gained more advantage in the final stages, but McGregor remained firm to reject Jacobs before Lithgow finished a head corner that did not enter.
The replacement of the Rangers, Glen Middleton, demanded a penalty to the end of the match after a meeting with Jacobs, but again Thomson looked elsewhere.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page from the Almanac section of the "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and CONTANDO... was born in Germany the physical future Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that culminated in the device known as a Geiger counter.
The counter Geiger, who has since been a pillar of science, has also become a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "The Bells of Coronado", with the actors Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in the seemingly incompatible roles of cowboy scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put your headphones on, you can hear the effect of the waves emitted by the radioactivity of the minerals."
Evans: "It's like a radio!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945 when he was about 63 years old.
But the invention that bears his name remains alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells and kill them.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells to a patient and alter them in the laboratory.
Thus, they can "see" a protein common to many cancers and reinject them.
A vaccine trial is generating promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw how her ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells to a patient and alter them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to many cancers, called HER2, and then reinject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland commented: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promotes the growth of different types of cancer", such as breast, ovarian, lung or colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and "teaching" them to attack cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarked on a diatribe in favor of Trump with a MAGA cap after his appearance in SNL.
It didn't work out.
Kanye West was abused in the Saturday Night Live study after an erratic performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump, and said he would stand for elections in 2020.
After the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, during which he used the cap with the message Make America Great Again, he started depotricating against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I often talk to someone white and ask me how I can like Trump if he's a racist.
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL started Matt Damon's sketch program in which Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's statement to the Senate Judicial Committee on charges of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it didn't retransmit, comedian Chris Rock uploaded West's flurry recording to social media.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to ridicule West with the release.
In addition, West told the public that he had had a hard time behind him for wearing that hat.
"They got in with me.
They told me not to go out with your hat on.
They got in with me!
And then they tell me I'm asleep," the Washington Examiner said.
West continued: "Do you want to see how sleepy I am?" and added that "it was going to put on its superman layer, because that meant no one could tell you what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try it with love."
His comments were welcomed by the public on at least two occasions and SNL members seemed to be ashamed, according to Variety. One person told the magazine: "The study was completely silent."
West had been invited to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West bewildered many when he left the stage to sing I Love it dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
West received the support of the conservative leader TRUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "One of the bravest spirits: THANKS TO RESIST BEFORE MUCHEDUMBER".
Karen Hunter, presenter of an interview program, tweeted that West was simply "being himself and that is absolutely wonderful."
"But I decide NOT to reward someone (by buying his music or his clothes, or by supporting his art) who I consider to be hugging and spreading a dangerous ideology for my community.
He's free.
We too," he added.
Before the program, the rapper announced on Twitter that the name had been changed, saying that he was now "the person previously known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name, following Diddy's steps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, Snoop Dogg, has also been called Snoop Lion, not forgetting the missing legend of music, Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and later to the artist previously known as Prince.
Charge of attempted murder for stabbing in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after being stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, according to the police.
The accused is expected to appear on Monday at the Belfast Court of First Instance.
The prosecution will review the charges.
Kit Harington, star of Thrones Game, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is famous for his role as Jon Snow in the violent series of medieval HBO fantasy, Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor has attacked the stereotype of the male hero, saying that those on-screen roles often passed on to young boys who had to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit commented that he believes "something has gone wrong" and questioned how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his tronos game-sharing partner, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he seems "very important" to address this issue.
"Personally, it seems pretty important to me right now, where have we been wrong about masculinity?" he said.
"What have we been teaching men as they grew up, thinking about the problems they see now?"
Kit believes that television can have part of the responsibility for the increasing toxic masculinity due to their male characters.
He continued: "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television, and on the street, that makes young people feel that they have to be this concrete form of man?
I think that's one of the great questions of our time. How do we change it?
Because it is clear that something has gone wrong in the education of young people."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in any prequel or sequel of Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, asserting that he is "happy with battlefields and horses".
From November on, Kit will feature True West, Sam Shepard's play that tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that he believes that getting to know his wife Rose is the best that he's taken out of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in the series, so, in that sense, she has given me my future family and my life from now on," she said.
Rose represented Ygritte, the loving interest of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the fantastic series awarded with Emmy prizes.
The couple married in June 2018 in a Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% more new cases
China has announced an increase of 14 per cent in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people in the country, according to health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018 only some 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of these were sexually infected, which means a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people taking HIV in this way has been reduced in full practice, declared by the Chinese health authorities at a congress in Yunnan province.
Every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by 100,000 people.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem in China's LTTB community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the LGTB collective suffers a lot of discrimination.
Because of the conservative values of the country, studies have estimated that between 70% and 90% of men who have sex with other men will end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are because they do not use adequate protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV medicines as part of an attempt to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of his staff leaks data from Republican Party senators and asserts that it is "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
The representative Maxine Waters criticized on Saturday the allegations that a member of her staff had published personal data from three U.S. senators of the Republican Party on Wikipedia's pages about legislators.
The L.A. Democrat claimed that these charges were driven by commentators and websites of "extreme right".
"Minds, lies, and more vile lies," Waters commented in a Twitter post.
Allegedly, the information published included the addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
On Thursday, an unknown person from the Capitol posted the information on the Internet during a session of the Senate panel on allegations of inappropriate sexual conduct against Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court.
The leak was made at some point after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the origin of the publications was associated with the Waters office and made public the data of a Waters staff member, according to the Capitol.
"This baseless accusation is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal data and security have been affected as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations, was not responsible for the leaking of this information at all.
This baseless claim is completely false and an absolute lie."
The Waters statement aroused immediate criticism on the Internet, including those of the former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"Remind this information with anger," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests that not the time needed to be a member of Congress.
When someone's accused of something he didn't do, he shouldn't be angry.
He mustn't rebel.
He must not question the accuser's motives.
You must keep calm and serenity."
It seems that Fleischer wanted to compare the reaction of Waters with the critics of the Democrats to Judge Kavanaugh, whom the detractors accused to appear too angry during the appearance of Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who aims to disband Waters in the mid-term elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's very serious," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said that his office had alerted "the relevant authorities and law enforcement entities to these fraudulent charges."
"We will ensure that the authors are discovered," he continued, "and that they are considered legally responsible for all these destructive and dangerous actions for all members of my staff."
Johnny's Criticism English: Again in action. Rowan Atkinson's spy parody is short
Now it has become a tradition to look for scripts at Brexit in any new film with a British approach. It seems that this is what it is appropriate to do with this new delivery of the action parodied franchise and comedy Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Returns.
Is this ironic self-satisfaction about how clearly nonsense we are the nation's new export opportunity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his shilling eyes and his inexpressive face, has renewed his license to kick for the second time. Only his name already gives clues that, more than anything else, it is a comic creation designed for non-English speaking cinematographers.
Of course, it is the ridiculous secret agent who, despite his strange claims to overthrow glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr. Bean and a pinch of that guy who played a single note on the subject of Firecars that was played at the inauguration ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games.
In addition, it was originally based on the mysterious traveler and international man represented years ago by Atkinson on Barclaycard's already forgotten television advertisements, sowing chaos behind him.
In this last delivery, there is one or two good moments.
I loved to see Johnny English approaching a helicopter dressed in medieval armor while the propellers were collapsing against the helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy pops into the eye, but humor remains rather short and is strangely superfluous, especially now that franchises of "serious" films like 007 and Mission impossible add comic ingredients without problems.
Humor seems more aimed at children than adults and, for me, the absurd misadventures of Johnny English are not as ingenious and correct as Atkinson's silent jokes on Mr. Bean's role.
Now, the repeated argument today is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A computer pirate has infiltrated the supersecret network of spies in Britain, revealing the identities of all its agents in active action in the face of the dismay of the in-service agent, a pitifully small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the drop that fills the glass for the prime minister, a pompous and cornered character who is seeing how his political popularity is sunk: Emma Thompson gives the best of himself in this character who is almost like Theresa May, but the script does not leave much room to work.
His intelligence advisors inform him that, as all spies are at risk, he will have to resort to someone who is retired.
That has to be the torpe Johnny English, who now teaches in a pejo school, although he gives off-official lessons on how to be a secret agent: there are some good jokes, as this is a spying academy similar to that of Rock School.
English is moved to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and meets with his former compunche Bough, represented again by Ben Miller.
Now, Bough is a man married to a submarine captain, a nice paper for which Vicki Pepperdine is not used enough.
Thus, the Batmans and Robins who do things terribly wrong in His Majesty's Secret Service return to action, with the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova, represented by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is falling into the dangerous clutches of a charismatic multimillionaire in the world of technology who claims that he can solve the computer problems of Britain: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurd situations: dress up as waiters, set fire to an elegant French restaurant, unleash chaos hiding in the luxurious Volta yacht; besides, English becomes pure anarchy by trying to use a virtual reality helmet to familiarize itself with the interior of Volta's house.
Definitely, they were used in depth in that last sequence, but, however funny and stupendous, the set continues to convey a somewhat childish feeling.
A fairly regular product.
Like with the other films of Johnny English, I couldn't help wondering if the British film industry couldn't give Rowan Atkinson a role that would bring true justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is drawing up a plan for the British to work four days a week, but they cover five days.
Jeremy Corbyn Labour Party is going to think of a radical plan with which the British would work four days a week, but they would get five.
Supposedly, the party wants business owners to set aside savings from the revolution in artificial intelligence (IA) to the workers, giving them an additional day off.
Thus, employees would enjoy a three - day weekend for the same salary.
According to the sources, the idea "would fit" into the plans and economic agenda of the party to tilt the country in favour of the workers.
This shift to a four-day week has received the support of the Trade Union Congress, as it is a way for workers to take sides in the changing economy.
As a high-ranking Labour Party member commented to The Sunday Times: The announcement of a review of the directive is expected before the end of the year.
"It will not be achieved from one day to another, but the four-day working week is definitely an issue that the party hopes to incorporate in order to rebalance the economy in favour of the worker, as well as in the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this kind of idea, as the Green Party already promised a four-day working week in its campaign for the 2017 general elections.
However, for the time being, not all the Labour Party supports this decision.
A Labour spokesman said: "The four-day working week is not part of the party's policy and is not going to be discussed at this time."
The shadow finance minister, John McDonnell, used the Labour Party conference last week to expose his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was willing to recover powers from "anonymous directors" and "taken advantage" by utilities.
The Minister's plans in the shade also include the idea that the current shareholders of the water companies do not recover their full participation, since a labor government could apply deductions that correspond to perceived irregularities.
It also confirmed its intention to include workers in corporate boards and to create inclusive property funds in which 10 % of private sector business shares should be allocated to employees, which would involve annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk in "60 Minutes" about the FBI investigation around Kavanaugh and if I could change their mind
The FBI's investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed at least one week the final vote for his confirmation as a Supreme Court judge and also raises the question of whether the results that are concluded could influence some Republican senator who finally decides to withdraw his support.
In an interview on Sunday, the "60 Minutes" journalist, Scott Pelley, asked Republican senators. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham talk about whether the FBI could bring out information that would change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague in South Carolina.
"Of course," Kennedy said.
"I was in favour of proceeding with the hearing, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after all this happened, that the allegation came out, and I asked him, 'Did you do it?'
He was firm, resolute, stingy."
Graham's vote, however, seems unmovable.
"I already have a decision about Brett Kavanaugh and would overlook the accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett turned him down," Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of the people she appoints have been able to confirm it.
36 years ago.
It's always the same, I don't see anything new in this case."
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Have you managed to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival, where an impressive star cartel gathers for an equally impressive mission: ending poverty in the world.
This year, in its seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see how tens of thousands of people will move to the Great Lawn of Central Park to enjoy performances such as those of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the actual objective of the event: ending extreme poverty in 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international awareness-raising group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
If you wish to receive a free entry for the event (unless you can pay a VIP entry), the concert attendees have had to complete a series of tasks or "actions", as volunteers, send emails to a world leader, make a phone call or anything else that serves to raise awareness about your goal of ending poverty.
However, what has the Global Citizen achieved at 12 years of reaching its goal?
The idea of rewarding with a free concert is a genuine way of persuading people to take action or is it just a form of so-called "clickivism", which is called the posture we adopt when we think we are doing something really useful when signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters in favour of a large number of different objectives.
Thanks to these actions, they claim to have achieved that world leaders announced commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will have an impact on the lives of more than $2250 million in 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements that emerged from their shares, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or collected.
The group estimates that guaranteed funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Among the most important commitments is the "The Power of Nutrition", an association of UK-based investors and executors with the common commitment to "help children grow and develop with all their potential." To this end, it has been proposed to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end the country's malnutrition after receiving more than 4700 tweets from Global Citizens collaborators.
"Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens collaborators like you, we can score a small milestone in the history of social injustice from malnutrition," said Tracey Ullman, ambassador of "The Power of Nutrition", to the crowd during a concert in April 2018 in London.
The group also stated that, having carried out more than 5000 actions to improve nutrition in the UK for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, with which 5 million women and children will benefit from nutrition-related interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on your website about what we believe can be done to remedy extreme poverty,
a Global Citizen collaborator replied: "It will be a long and hard road and, on many occasions, we will stumble and fall.
But, as movements for human rights and against apartheid have already achieved before, we will achieve our objectives, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae are some of the performances we'll have at this year's New York event, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use the Navy to carry out the blockade on Russian energy exports - Secretariat of the Interior
"If necessary," Washington could resort to his Navy to prevent Russian energy from shaking markets, including that of the Middle East, revealed the U.S. Interior Secretary, Ryan Zinke, as published in the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's alliance with Syria, in particular where it operates at the request of the legitimate government, is only a pretext for expansion into new markets.
"I am convinced that they are in the Middle East to negotiate with energy, as they do with Eastern Europe, becoming the most southern European supplier," he said.
Furthermore, according to official information, there are ways and means of addressing this issue.
"The United States, with its Navy, has the capacity to ensure that the sea lanes remain open and, if necessary, could even block them to ensure that the energy does not end in the market," he said.
Zinke addressed people who attended an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that is defined as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches in his negotiations with Russia and Iran, and warned that they are, in fact, the same.
"The economic alternative in Iran and Russia is basically to use and replace fuels," he warned while pointing out that Russia only knows how to do one thing, which is to base its economy on fossil fuels.
These statements are made when the Trump administration has been trying to boost the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe and to point out that it is a function of Russia, which is the cheapest option for European consumers.
To do so, members of the Trump administration, including Donald Trump himself, try to persuade Germany to abandon the "inappropriate" North Stream 2 pipeline project, which, Trump says, will turn Berlin into a hostage in Moscow.
Moscow has insisted at all times that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which is worth $11 billion, is intended to double the current capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fervent opposition to the project only responds to economic reasons and is a show of more unfair competition.
"I think we all share the idea that energy cannot become a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said, after holding a meeting with Rick Perry, the U.S. Energy Secretary, in Moscow last September.
The US position has, however, been met with Germany's rejection, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The organisation leading the industry in Germany, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), has asked the US not to intervene in EU energy policy or bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"It is a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, director of the German Industry Federation (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will carefully examine the possibility of running for the presidency in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
The Senator by Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she will consider joining the presidential race after the mid-term elections.
During an appearance at Holyoke City Hall in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that this challenge was being addressed.
"It is time for women to come to Washington to amend our fractured government and finally to have women among the leaders," The Hill said.
"After 6 November, I will seriously consider the possibility of running for the presidency."
Warren gave his opinion on President Donald Trump during an appearance in the City Hall and stated that "he was taking the country on the wrong path."
"I really care about the damage Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren spoke out on Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet last Friday, Warren stated that "it is absolutely necessary for the FBI to investigate what happened before the vote."
On Thursday, a poll was published in which, however, a majority of Warren's own voters do not believe that it should be presented for the 2020 elections.
58% of Massachusetts voters stated that the senator should not be presented, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe survey.
However, 32% of respondents did support their candidacy.
The survey showed greater support for the former governor, Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent support for a possible candidacy and 48 per cent against it.
Other well-known members of the Democratic Party spoke about the potential candidate for 2020 for former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, according to the agency Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin's post-traumatic stress disorder at a Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining in September.
Last Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"The situation that my son is going through, for all that has happened since he came back, is well known to the other families who suffer the effects of TEPT and other wounds that our soldiers are returning to," he told the public that he was gathered at a rally in favor of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to this arrest as the great taboo no one wants to talk about, and commented on his son and other war veterans who "return with a different, hardened behavior, wondering if there really exists such respect for what his fellow soldiers and aviators, as well as all other members of the army, have given their country."
On Monday he was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, accused of an episode of domestic violence against a woman, interfering with a complaint of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the effects of drugs or alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla police department.
18 states, D.C. support the challenge of achieving a new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support a judicial remedy to the new United States policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence or gangs.
Representatives of the 18 states and the district presented a "friendly" writing on Friday in Washington to show their support for an asylum seeker facing the current directive, NBC News reported.
The full name of the applicant has not been disclosed in the case of "Grace v. Sessions" submitted in August by the U.S. Union of Civil Liberties (ACLU, American Civil Liberties Union) against federal policy.
She said her partner "and her children, who are members of a violent gang," abused her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers representing these states defending Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum applications to the United States, as nations facing widespread problems related to domestic and gang violence.
The new asylum policy in the United States revoked a 2014 decision taken by the Migration Appeals Board (IAB) whereby undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence could apply for asylum in this country.
Attorney General of the District of Columbia Karl Racine made statements on Friday stating that the new policy "is ignorant of decades of international, federal and state law."
"According to federal legislation, all asylum applications must be failed by virtue of the particular facts and circumstances of the application and, on the other hand, this exception violates that principle," says the amicus curiae.
The lawyers also indicated in the writing that the policy that denies entry to immigrants harms the U.S. economy by asserting that they often become entrepreneurs more often and "are a necessary labor force."
Prosecutor General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"People leaving their countries of origin may apply for asylum on the grounds of persecution or threats by race, religion, nationality or membership of a social group or a particular political opinion," said Sessions when he announced this directive on 11 June.
Asylum was never created as a measure to alleviate all problems, not even all serious problems, faced daily by people around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu while increasing the number of dead in a race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation was becoming more and more disastrous.
"The situation is very tense," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, while trying to console her baby with fever in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute ambulances arrive with more bodies.
And clean water is scarce."
Some residents have returned to their destroyed homes to reinvigorate among the few denied belongings left to them in an effort to recover as much as possible.
There are hundreds of people injured and hospitals, also damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, are overburdened.
Some of the wounded; among them, Dwi Haris, who has a broken back and shoulder, rested on the outside of the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated outside the building due to the continuous replicas, also very strong.
He could not help crying when he told us about the violent earthquake that he experienced while on the 5th floor of the hotel with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to get safe.
I was trapped in the remains of the wall down, I think," Haris told Associated Press. He and his family were in town to celebrate a wedding.
"I heard my wife ask for help and then a tremendous silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're all right."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of "bullying" with "propagandistic announcements"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page announcement in a US newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread its propaganda.
Last Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump referred to China Daily's payment supplement in the Des Moines Register, Iowa's most selling newspaper, after accusing China of wanting to interfere in the elections to the US Congress on November 6, which China strongly denies.
The accusation Trump made about Beijing's attempt to influence the U.S. elections marked what U.S. officials indicated to Reuters as a new phase in a growing Washington-initiated campaign to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote their trade activities, Beijing and Washington are currently being blocked in a growing trade war that has led them to increase their import tariff levels on both sides.
China's compensatory tariffs that applied to the beginning of the trade war were thought to fall on exporters of states such as Iowa, which supported the Trump Republican Party, according to Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former governor of Iowa, who is one of China’s leading exporters of agricultural products, said Beijing had harmed US workers, farmers and entrepreneurs.
As Branstad wrote in an opinion article on Sunday's Des Moines Register, China "is intensifying this pressure further with advertising publications in our free press."
"To try to spread its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the precious American tradition of freedom of expression and free press by trying to publish a pay ad in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, in the street kiosk where we are here in Beijing, there are only a few discrepant voices and no real reflection of the different views that people in China can have about the worrying trajectory that is taking over the economy of their country, as the media are controlled by the strong pressure of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most relevant newspapers in China circumvented the offer to publish" his article, although he did not specify which newspaper it was.
Analysts point out that Republicans are distancing themselves from women before the mid-legislative vote with the Kavanaugh debacle
As many renowned Republicans are closing ranks in favour of the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh in the face of the various accusations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that there may be a setback, especially by women, in the forthcoming mid-legislature votes.
The emotions surrounding this fact have been very intense and many Republicans have expressed that they want to move forward with the vote.
"In these kinds of issues it's not possible to go back," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at the University of Syracuse, at The Hill in an article that was published on Saturday.
Reeher expressed doubt that the last attempt by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to stand in favour of the FBI's investigation would be enough to calm down the distasteful voters on this matter.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, according to Washington newspaper, D.C.
On Friday morning, the protestors who gathered at the Senate gates sang "November is coming!" (November will come soon!) at the time when the Republicans who controlled the Judicial Committee decided to proceed with the candidacy of Kavanaugh, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic said.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats is out of the picture," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, on the news site.
"People say that the impact is already very relevant and, indeed, so it is.
But it could be even greater, especially among the indecisive women in the outlying neighborhoods and the younger voters, between 18 and 29 years old, who do not usually vote even if they do not like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony in detail his allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts indicated that there could be a setback if Republicans continued with the confirmation.
"This matter has become a great mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, the former president of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week, NBC News reported.
"It is no longer just a matter of the committee's vote nor the final vote, not even of whether they sit on the bench at Kavanaugh; it is also the way Republicans have handled all this and how they have dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, director of the US Priories (a group that helps in the choice of Democrats).
However, the Americans seem to be divided; they don't know who they should believe after the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, although they are a few more who are put on the side of the latter.
In a new survey by YouGov, 41% of respondents are reported to believe Ford's testimony definitively or likely, while 35% claim to believe Kavanaugh definitively or likely.
Furthermore, 38 % claimed that they believed that Kavanaugh had, in all probability or definitively, lied during his testimony, while 30 % said the same thing about Ford.
After Flake's push, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's statements, as well as at least the statements of another complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified under oath to the Senate Judicial Commission last week and indicated that Kavanaugh raped her by being drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez claimed that the Supreme Court candidate showed him his genitals at a party when he was studying in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that tries to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is the latest technology legend project. A company based on Berners-Lee's Solid open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store your data and which people will have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is "to dominate the world".
"It has to be now," he said about the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to enable users to create their own "on-line personal data storage" or a POD.
It can contain lists, pending task lists, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in a browser and at the same time.
Something that is exclusive in the storage of personal online data is that the user is the one who completely decides who can access what type of information.
The company calls it "personal capacity through data."
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company's CEO, John Bruce, is to incorporate resources, processes and skills needed to make Solid reach everyone.
For the time being, the company is formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that bought IBM, some of the developers included in the template that were hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralized apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether or not a radical change is going to be introduced where all their business models are completely modified from one day to the next.
"We're not asking for permission."
In a publication in Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote about Inrupt that "its mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new website created in Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had a very influential role in the debate on net neutrality.
Even though I am launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this next era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The cleric who won a Victoria Cross in World War I
The only clergyman of the Church of England who won a Victoria Cross during World War I as a fighter has been honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann obtained this award on September 29, 1918 in the attack of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, a sniper killed him four days later and he never knew he had been granted the greatest British military honor.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren discovered a memorial stone in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of them, Michael Vann, said it was "of a special symbolism" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after the battle that made him deserve the decoration to his grandfather.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann guided his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a thick fog and under the intense fire of machine guns and guns."
He then ran to the line of fire and, with the "greater courage", made the line move before reaching a single gun with one hand and knock down three of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, only a month after the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the actions that his grandfather carried out were "so great that I will never be able to reach his height, but they were very rewarding."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a crown of flowers after the parade, with the participation of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "it was a privilege for him to be part of the parade" and added that "the value of a true hero is evident when he is shown such a large support."
MMA followers were up all night for Bellator 206, but only Peppa Pig saw
Imagine you stay up all night to see the whole Bellator 206 so you won't finally let him see the main event.
The San José poster had 13 fights, six included in the main card, and in the UK it was going to broadcast live at night on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready to face each other, UK viewers were amazed when the program changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were not surprised after having had to stay awake until early in the morning just to see the fight.
A Twitter follower described the change in cartoons as "a heavy joke."
"There is a government regulation that regulates the content that is issued from 6 a.m. and this was not appropriate, so they had to change the programming of children," said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President of Marketing and Communication of Bellator, when we asked him about the transmission.
"Peppa la cerdita," yes.
The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, said they are going to modify the program to include British viewers in the next editions.
"When I think about the broadcast option, I think it can work," Coker said.
"But it's 6 a.m. on Sunday, so we couldn't do it until Sunday at our time, which would already be Monday for them.
We're looking at how to do it.
Believe me, when the programming was changed, a lot of messages were received and not everyone was friendly, precisely.
We tried to fix it, because at first we thought it was a technical problem.
But that was not the case, it was a government problem.
I can promise that next time it won't happen.
We will reduce it to five fights instead of six, which are the ones we normally have done. We try to offer more than usual so that fans were happy and we passed.
It is a very unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior for his sexuality
The Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to the rest because of his sexuality, although this was, in turn, what motivated him to become a triumphant.
At age 24, he told us he didn't realize until he got to high school that "not everyone was like me."
In the first program of Desert Island Discs Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said that his intention to talk about gay rights was to transmit "hope" to other people.
He also told us that becoming a father made it start to lessen the importance of winning at the Olympics.
The usual presenter of this mythical program, Kirsty Young, will be absent for a few months due to illness.
In Laverne's first show, Daley, who showed himself as a marginal, commented that he felt "lesser" to the rest during his childhood, because "you weren't socially accepted that you liked boys and girls."
He said: "Until today, that feeling of inferiority and being different has been what has really given me the power and strength to succeed."
He wanted to show that he was "something," he said, so he didn't disappoint when he finally discovered his sexuality.
The winner of two bronze medals in the Olympics has become a prominent profile of the LGBT movement and its image has been used at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to claim that more countries decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he told it because he felt fortunate to live in freedom, without reprisals, and wanted to transmit that "hope" to other people.
The world's three-time champion declared that it was also a surprise for him to fall in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married a 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, although he specified that the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you live so long from such a young age" (it was at his first 14-year-old Olympics and his father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone of the same age who's been through the same highs and lows as you.
The couple had a son in June who was called Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said their "global perspective" had changed.
"If they had asked me last year, all the answers would have turned around 'I have to win a gold medal'," he said.
"But you know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is definitely Robbie."
His son is called his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 years after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he was going to die and, in fact, one of the last things he asked is if they had the passes for London 2012, because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I was not able to tell you that I was not going to be able to be in the first row," he said.
"I had his hand among mine when he stopped breathing and it was not until that very moment when he stopped breathing and died that I realized that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"At that moment I knew that was what I had dreamed my whole life: competing in the pool in front of mine in some Olympic Games, there was nothing better," he said.
This fact was also the one that inspired him to choose his first song, Proud of Heather Small, which accompanied him in the preparation phase of the Olympic Games. He was still put on chicken skin.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, in low form, stayed on the dock at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to reverse his way if he wants to avoid becoming a sad hit.
Mickelson, who played at the event that takes place every two years to get a record for the 12th time, was disbanded by Captain Furyk for the four-balls and four-somes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as so many times he has done for the United States, the five-time major tournament champion had to settle for cheering in a few moments and, in others, try to perfect his game in the field and thus be able to correct what afflicts him.
Never the most direct driver, not even at the highest moment of his career, the 48-year-old player is not in his best shape for the Le Golf National field, where the long rough continually punishes with wrong blows.
And, if the field is no longer disappointing enough, Mickelson, in Sunday's ninth match, faces the brilliant British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined the debutant Tommy Fleetwood to win the four games they've played this week.
If the Americans, which were four points below when the 12 individual parties started, started out in an impressive way, the Mickelson party could have been decisive.
Furyk showed confidence in his partner, couldn't say much more.
"He understood perfectly the role he had today, he slapped me in the back and, surrounding me with his arm, he said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of self-confidence.
He's in the Hall of Fame and he's contributed a lot to these teams before and this week.
I probably couldn't imagine him playing two games.
I thought it would be more, but that's how it came out and that's how we thought it had to be.
He wants to be there, like the rest."
On Sunday, Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's mark of more games played by the Ryder Cup.
It could be the last of a whole Ryder Cups trajectory that had never so clearly matched the levels of its individual brand.
Mickelson has 18 cattle, 20 lost and 7 equals, although Furyk said his presence brought many more intangible values to the team.
"It's fun, sarcastic, ingenious, likes to make fun of others; it's great to have it on the team," he explained.
"I think younger players have been delighted to have it as support, also this week; it was fun.
It brings a lot more than just game."
European captain, Thomas Bjorn, knows that leadership can disappear very soon
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows very well that, although you are entering with a substantial advantage in the last days of the Ryder Cup, it can easily become an uncomfortable tournament.
The Danish made his debut in the 1997 Valderrama match, where a gang led by Seve Ballesteros held a five-point lead over the Americans, but in the end they only managed to end the others by stepping on their heels for a minimum margin, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You don't stop remembering that we did a great tournament in Valderrama; we also did it in Brookline and lost, we did it in Valderrama and we won, but for very little," said Bjorn, portrayed, after seeing the generation of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday lead it with a 10-6 in Le Golf National.
History will teach me and everyone that this team is not finished.
You have to give it all tomorrow.
Get out there and do what you have to do.
This doesn't end until the dots are on the score.
We have a goal to fulfill, which is to win this trophy, and that's all we have to think about.
I say it all the time, I focus on the 12 players on our team, but we are very aware of what is on the other side where they are, no less, than the best players in the world."
Proud of what your players have done in a very hard golf course, Bjorn added: "I wouldn't want to go ahead.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
What prevails tomorrow are individual actions and this is different.
It's great to share what's going on with a partner when things go well, but when you're there alone, you test all your ability as a golfer.
That's the message that needs to be passed on to the players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now it's time to put your partner aside, go and get the best of yourself."
In front of Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will try to make his players do it better individually than they did as couples, with the exceptions being Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points of four.
Furyk himself has been at both ends in the last days of these great tournaments and has been part of the team he won in Brookline and then ended up losing when Europe carried out the "Milage of Medina."
"I remember every word," he told us when we asked him how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, managed to motivate his players on the last day.
"We have 12 super important games tomorrow, but we have to start as well as we did at Brookline, as you did at Medinah.
When we all advance in one direction, all the pressure falls on those middle parties.
We defined our strategy and made them come out with the feeling that we were going to try to do something magical tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned the task of trying to lead the fight and face Rory McIlroy in the main party, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans on the second half of the list.
"I was with this group of boys in this order because I think they cover the whole route," Bjorn said about their individual selections.
The new German warship, postponed again
The new German Navy frigate should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the old ships of the Cold War era, but it will not be done until at least next year due to faulty systems and the progressive increase in costs, local media reported.
The delivery of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the ship leading the new frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class, has now postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit a statement by a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the problems that arose after the delivery annoyed the conclusion of the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class that requested the Navy in 2007 will replace the old frigates of the Bremen class.
We know that they will include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft missiles, as well as some invisibility technologies, such as radar signals, infrared and very low acoustics.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, so that they can be deployed up to two years away from the ports of origin.
However, the continuing delays have led to the fact that the innovators (who were supposed to allow Germany to project its power in overseas) will be old-fashioned when they start providing service, Die Zeit points out.
The unfortunate Fragate F125 held headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into operation and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned a boat to a shipyard after its delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the return, but the German media cited a number of crucial "software and hardware defects" that left the ship virtually useless if it was sent to a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors: half of the personnel in the old Bremen class frigates.
It was also found that the ship has an excessive burden, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future updates.
It is believed that the "Rheinland-Pfalz" of 7,000 tons is twice as heavy as other similar class ships that the Germans used in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the price of the entire project, including crew training, has also been a problem.
It is believed that it has reached the €31 billion ($36 billion), instead of the initial €22 billion.
The problems facing the new frigates are of particular relevance in the light of the recent warnings about the reduction of the German naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee of the German parliament, acknowledged that the Navy is "falling without ships capable of deploying".
The officer said the problem has worsened over time, because old ships were discharged, but have not been replaced with others.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates had been able to join the Navy.
The National Trust spies on the secret life of bats
This new research, which has been carried out in a state of the Scottish Highlands, tries to discover how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
All that is found is expected to shed more light on the behaviour of the only flying mammals and to help guide future conservation activities.
The study, carried out by the National Trust for Scotland, will follow the common and soprano bats, as well as the Daubenton river bats and long-eared browns of the Inverewe gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in strategic locations of the property to track bat activities during the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile investigations with portable detectors.
The experts will analyze the sounds collected in the recordings to discover the frequency of bat calls and what species they do.
There will then be a report and a habitat map to create a detailed picture of the environment and its behaviour.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation consultant for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of meadows and how forests should be maintained for bats and other associated species.
The bat populations in Scotland and the United Kingdom have been considerably reduced in the last century.
They are under threat from the construction and development that affects their nests and the loss of their habitat.
Wind turbines and electrical wiring can also pose a risk to them, as can insecticide papers and other chemical treatments of construction materials or attacks of domestic cats.
The bats are not really blind,
but because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes to achieve their goal.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique that locates ants and obstacles on their flight route.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes over the subject of bats very seriously.
He has ten trained experts in this area, who regularly conduct surveys, nest inspections and occasionally rescues.
The organization has inaugurated even the first and only reserve dedicated to bats in Scotland in the state of Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The property manager, David Thompson, says it is the ideal territory for them.
"Here, in Threat, we have a fantastic area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and all the right habitat.
However, there are still many unknown things about bats, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us better understand what they need to develop."
It stresses the importance of checking for bats before carrying out maintenance tasks within the properties, since a colony of farmed animals can involuntaryly be destroyed and 400 females and offspring could be killed, which would mean annihilating a whole local population.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them, as well as to destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish officer responsible for the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to cooperate.
He said, "We still have a lot to learn about bats and many other species about which we don't know how their populations evolve."
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape at the same time as his lawyers pursue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has catalogued rape reports as "fake news", and says that people "want to meet" at the expense of his name.
His lawyers have been instructed to report the German newspaper Der Spiegel, where the statements were published.
In front of Portugal and Juventus, he is accused of raping an American woman, named Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He was accused of having paid $375 000 to cover up the incident, as reported by Der Spiegel on Friday.
With a video from Instagram Live that has already accumulated 142 million followers a few hours after the news was published, Ronaldo, 33, struck the story as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false," says the five-time Golden Ball winner looking at the camera.
"They just want publicity at the cost of my name.
It's the same story as always.
They want to get famous just to mention myself, but that's it, I can't help it.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine," the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the accusations that have appeared in what they have called "an inadmissible report of suspicions in the field of privacy," Reuters reports.
Counsel Christian Schertz said that the player will try to obtain compensation for "moral damages for an amount corresponding to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious breaches of his personal rights in recent years".
It appears that the alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room and there he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents registered at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayor said Ronaldo was surrounded after the alleged incident and told him that he was in a "99 percent" a "good boy" and that he had failed that remaining "one percent".
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but was consented.
Mayorga also claims that he went to the police and took photographs of the injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because he had "terror of reprisals" and worried "to be humiliated in public".
The 34-year-old woman claims that she is trying to nullify the agreement, as she continues to be traumatized by the facts.
When the alleged aggression took place, Ronaldo was about to join the Real Madrid from Manchester United and this summer he has changed to Juve, a great Italian football for a €100 million contract.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would always regret losing car manufacturers
The United Kingdom "would regret all its life" if it lost its position as world leader in automobile manufacturing after Brexit, said Industry Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "a concern" that Toyota UK should tell the BBC that, if Britain left the EU without an agreement, production would temporarily stop at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer claimed that the impact of delays on customs in the case of an agreed Brexit could result in loss of jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures Toyota Auris and Avensis models, produced about 150 000 cars last year, of which 90 % was exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that, if Britain breaks with the EU at the end of March, there will be production stops in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's CEO in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom have shown their fears about leaving the EU without an agreement, particularly in relation to cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers revolve around the problems that might arise in the assembly chains in the case of an agreed Brexit.
The Toyota production line is based on the adjusted production mode (‘just in time’ or at the last moment), where the parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU to manufacture cars per charge.
If the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without an agreement on 29 March, there could be an interruption at the border which, according to the sector, could lead to delays and the decommissioning of parts.
For Toyota it would be impossible to house the amount of material equivalent to more than one day of inventory at its Derbyshire plant, said the company and, in that case, would stop production.
Mr Clark said that theresa May's Chequers plan, where future relations with the EU are established, is "calibrated precisely to avoid such controls in the border crossings".
"We need an agreement. We want to have the best agreement that not only allows us to get out of the way right now but we have to take advantage of the opportunity," he said on BBC Radio 4.
"Toyota's evidence, among many other manufacturers, is that we have to be able to continue with what, until now, has been a tremendously successful supply chain."
Toyota has not been able to say how long production would stop, but warned that, in the long term, the added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately the costs.
Peter Tsouvalaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the head of the United Union at the plant, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "According to my experience, once these jobs are lost, they never recover."
A spokesman for the government said, "We have put in place a precise and convincing plan defining our future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House.
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could "possess another week," as he continues the dispute over the candidate to Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating interference in the Russian elections, links between Trump's and Russia's aid, and a possible obstruction of justice by the President.
The expectation before Trump decides to dismiss the Deputy Chief of Staff or not and thereby compromise Mueller's independence has fuelled Washington's daily routines for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein recorded the talks he had with Trump with a microphone he himself had to try to relegate to the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied it was true.
However, last Monday he went to the White House, among the news reports where he claims he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump (who was then at the United Nations in New York) for Thursday.
Trump said he would "do not" say goodbye to Rosenstein but the meeting had to be postponed to avoid a conflict with the hearing of the U.S. Senate Judicial Committee in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday Trump asked the FBI to investigate charges against Kavanaugh for a week, although this would entail delaying the Senate plenary vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Sunday in Fox News.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, he said: "No date has been set, it could be this week or it could be postponed another week, considering everything that is happening with the Supreme Court.
We're going to decide on the march and I'm going to report it to the press, just like I'm going to do."
Some journalists would rebut that statement: Sanders hasn't held any press conference in the White House since September 10.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked what the reasons were.
Sanders said that the shortage of press outlets was not due to an aversion to TV journalists who act grandiloquely, although he said, "I will not disagree with the fact that they are bragging."
Then she suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president holds more questions and answers than any other president before him," he said, while citing without proof: "We have contrasted those numbers."
Press conferences will continue to take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the option of asking the President of the United States directly, I think it's much better than to do it to me.
We tried to do it many times and you have seen us do it many times in the last few weeks, so that this would replace a press conference when you could talk to the President of the United States."
Trump usually answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public sessions or press wheels with dignitaries visiting him.
Press conferences with him only happen on very rare occasions.
In fact, this week, in New York, the president demonstrated why he was like this, where he made an angry appearance and sometimes bizarre, before the journalists who were gathered there.
The Secretary of State for Health writes EU workers from NHS Scotland about their fears about Brexit
The Secretary of State for Health has written to the EU staff working at the HHS in Scotland to express the country's gratitude and wish to follow them after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter just six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to covering the cost of citizenship applications for EU members working in public services that do not depend on central power.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union have followed on the exit at which the expected decisions were taken this autumn.
However, the UK government has also stepped up preparations for a possible scenario in which there would be no agreement.
I know all this must be very disconcerting to you.
It is, therefore, that I would like to reiterate now how much I value the contribution of each staff member, regardless of their nationality.
EU-wide professionals and other countries provide valuable experience and many skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, from which patients and communities we serve benefit.
Scotland is, without a doubt, your home and we would love to continue to count on you."
Christion Abercrombie is operating urgently after suffering a head injury.
Christion Abercrombie, a Tennessee State Tigers player, was intervened surgically in emergency after suffering a head wound last Saturday, when they lost 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed informed journalists that the injury occurred shortly before the break.
"I came to the band and collapsed right there," Reed said.
Both coaches and medical personnel administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the band line before placing it on a stretcher and taking it to be examined in depth.
A member of the Tennessee State staff told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the operation at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there was no detail about the type of injury yet or the damage caused" and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when it happened.
Abercrombie, redshirt sophomore, is playing in his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five tackles on Saturday before leaving the camp, with which he added a total of 18 throughout the season.
Foreigners will be subject to a higher property transfer tax when they buy property in the United Kingdom
Foreigners will be subject to a higher farm tax when they buy property in the United Kingdom and the extra money collected with this measure will be used to provide shelter to the "without roof" according to the new plans of the Conservatives
The change will neutralize the success of Corbyn's offensive to attract younger voters
The increase in the tax on the transmission of farms will be imposed on those who are not paying taxes in the United Kingdom
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million per year for the "no roof"
The additional money collected with the increase in the tax on the transmission of farms to foreign buyers of property in the UK will be used for aid to the "without ceiling", announced Theresa May today.
The measure is understood as an attempt to neutralize the success that Jeremy Corbyn is reaping with his promises to provide more affordable housing to attract younger voters and bully those with higher incomes.
The increase in the tax on the transmission of farms will be taxed on people and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and that money will be used to encourage government policy to combat the problem of begging on the streets.
The charge, which is a supplement to the current transmission tax, also including the increase in levels that was introduced two years ago on second-hand housing and the "buy-to-let" system, could be up to 3 %.
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year with this change.
It is estimated that 13% of London's new construction properties are bought by people who do not reside in the United Kingdom, causing higher prices and making it difficult for people who buy for the first time to have access to affordable housing.
Many of the country's most wealthy areas (especially in the capital) have become "famous cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of the time outside the country.
The new policy is coming just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the transmission tax in order to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the big builders of keeping very high prices on the property by buying eagerly land without intending to use it and urged Ms. May to eliminate the quotas that apply to affordable housing in order to solve the "dishonourable housing problem" in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a series of very attractive reforms for housing, including rent controls and the end of evictions for no reason.
It also proposes to give local authorities more powers to build new houses.
Ms. May said, "Last year I said that I would dedicate my position as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream of improving the lives of every new generation.
And that means solving the housing market, which is so devastated.
Great Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be that people who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, can buy housing more easily than the British working class.
The dream of having a home has become too difficult to reach for many people and the humiliation of having to sleep on the street remains too real."
Jack Ross: "My primary goal is to lead Scotland"
Sunderland coach says that his "priority objective" is to become a coach of Scotland at some point.
The 42-year-old Scots are thrilled to be able to revitalize the Northeastern club, which currently occupies third place in the League One (the third league division of England), three points from the first.
He passed to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premier last season.
"I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
But I only got a B cap," Ross told Sportssound at BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father when he was a child and it's something he's always made him want to come back.
This opportunity will only become a reality, however, if I manage to run a club successfully."
The predecessors of Ross as leader of the Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of the Alloa Athletic says he did not feel any fear when he went to such established names in such a large club, after rejecting proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At this point, success for me is measured according to whether I can return this club to the Premier League,
because the structure and facilities of this club certainly correspond to those of the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get it, but I could only consider that I have achieved my goal here when I can return the club to where it should be."
Ross has only been coaching for three years, after being an assistant in Dumbarton and a 15-month period in Hearts' technical body.
After that, he helped Alloa recover from the third division downhill and made St. Mirren move on to the edge of the downhill to win the championship the following season.
In fact, Ross claims that he feels more comfortable now than ever before during his career as a Clyde player, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a real crossroads," he recalled in reference to when he took over the Alloa.
"I always thought management was the best thing for me, much more than playing.
It could sound weird, because it was good, I could make a real living with it, and I enjoyed some epic moments.
But playing can be very hard.
You have to face a lot of things every week.
I still suffer from stress and pressure from that work; however, in the direction I feel good.
I always wanted to train and now I have managed to do it, it is the age of my adult life in which I felt better, without doubt."

According to a survey, the perfect time for a painting is 5.30 p.m. on Saturday
The summer heat wave has boosted the profits in British pubs fighting for survival, but concentrated all the pressure on restaurant chains.
Groups of pubs and bars saw their sales increased by 2.7 % in July, while the profits of restaurants decreased by 4.8 %, as the figures revealed.
Peter Martin, from the CGA consulting firm, who was charged with collecting the figures, commented: "The heat of these days and the fact that England continues in the world have still made the pattern of the previous month of June, in which pubs increased by 2.8% their profits, although restaurants have fallen even more.
The drop of 1.8 % in the commercial activity of restaurants in June was even worse in July.
The pubs and bars that serve mainly drinks had their month stronger, compared to most restaurants, in which they reduced profits.
Pubs serving mainly meals also suffered from heat, although not as drastic as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just want to go out for drinks.
In managed bars and pubs, sales of beverages increased by 6.6% during the month, while meals decreased by 3%.
Paul Newman of RSM's hotel and leisure analysts said: "These results follow the trend that we have seen since the end of April.
The time and impact of very important social or sporting events continue to be the most relevant factors with regard to sales on the off-home business market.
It is not surprising that the groups of restaurants continue to fight, although the 4.8% drop in sales compared to last year will be particularly painful in view of the continuing cost pressures.
The long and hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the gastronomic operators and time will tell if the most moderate temperatures we have had in August will provide the relief they need.
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new ones that have opened, was 2.7 % in July, reflecting the slow decline in branded implants.
In Coffer Peach Tracker, which oversees sales in the UK’s restaurants, bars and pubs sector, 47 operating groups collect and analyse performance data, with a combined billing of over £9 billion and is the market’s benchmark.
One in five children have secret social media accounts behind their parents
One in five children (some even 11 years old) have secret social media accounts behind their parents and teachers, according to a survey
The survey, carried out to 20,000 high school students, revealed a growth on the fake Instagram pages
The news has heightened fears that sexual content will be published
20% of students claimed to have a "primary" account showing their parents
One in five children (some even 11 years old) create social media accounts that hide adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary students revealed the rapid growth that has been experienced in fake Instagram accounts, a reference site to share photos.
The news has heightened fears that sexual content will be published.
A 20% of the students stated that they had a healthy "primary" account that they showed to their parents, while they had other private ones.
A mother who was found by chance with her 13-year-old daughter's secret site saw how a teenager encouraged others to "violate."
The research, conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters" and Headmisters" Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40% of children between 11 and 18 years of age had two profiles, and half of them admitted to have private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, said: "It is alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create spaces on the Internet where their parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the directive of the federation of athletics of Scotland
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to be part of the Scottish Athletics Federation directive as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the administrative body.
Doyle is the most awarded track and field athlete in Scotland and its president, Ian Beattie, described the change as a great opportunity for those who want sport to benefit from his great international experience in the past decade.
"Eilidh is recognized and respected throughout the entire athletic community in Scotland, the UK and the whole world, and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will greatly benefit by relying on it in its directive," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I like being the athlete's spokesman and I hope I can bring things and help develop sport in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 meters and 400 meters at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta between the four golds he won and now is a regular expert at the BBC, suffered a transient ischemic attack that left him unable to walk.
He wrote on Twitter, "A month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
According to doctors, only time would determine whether I would recover or how much I would do it.
It has been exhausting, but I managed to completely recover, I had to learn to walk again and I am currently doing exercises of agility.
Thanks for the messages and words of encouragement!"
The announcement of the sacaleches where it is compared to the mothers with cows divides to the opinion on the Internet
A sacaleches company has divided public opinion on the Internet with an ad where it compares to mothers who breastfeed with cows to which they milk.
To mark the launch of what is theoretically the "first silent sacaleches of the world", the consumer technology company Elvie published an ad inspired by a video with somewhat ironic music showing mothers who count the freedom given to them by the new milk extractor.
Four real women dance in a hay-filled barn as a dance floor, along with a few cows, with letters like, "Yes, I sort myself, but I don't have a tail" and "If you haven't noticed, they're not drunk, they're my breasts."
The choir goes on to say, "Order them, order them, I'm feeding their babies, order them, order them, I'm ordering my women."
However, the announcement, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, has created a great controversy.
With 77 000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received reactions from all kinds of people who have seen it, where many say it can focus on the "horrors" of the dairy sector.
"A very unfortunate decision to put cows to announce this product.
Like us, you have to get pregnant before giving birth to be able to produce milk, except that they are taken from their babies days after giving birth," one person wrote.
The Elvie milk extractor is discreetly adapted in a breast-feeding subjector (Elvie/Mother).
Another person commented: "Trummy for the mother and for the baby.
But, yes, why not use them to announce a mother's milk extractor that does stay with their babies?"
Another comment was: "Vaya a more uncanny ad".
However, other people defended the announcement, as a woman who admitted that the song was "sternifying."
"I think it's a great idea.
If I still gave birth, I'm sure I'd have one.
When using the bomb, I felt totally like a cow.
The ad's a little flattered, but I'm not turning it around anymore.
It's a product genius," a woman told us.
Another person commented: "It is a funny announcement addressed to mothers who use a nursing bomb (sometimes in the workplace or in public toilets), which makes them feel like cows.
The announcement neither praises nor judges the dairy sector."
At the end of the video, the group of women show that they have been dancing with discreet bombs placed inside the bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the perception that many women who take out milk with the bomb say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no cables or tubes, and is discreetly coupled into the sucker, which makes its users move, hold their babies and even go out on the street with the pump in operation.
Ana Balarin, a partner and ECD from Mother, comments: "Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By showing parallelism between expressive women and dairy cows, what we intended was to draw attention to the use of breastfeeding bombs and their challenges, while demonstrating in an entertaining and close way the incredible sense of freedom offered by the new bomb.
This is not the first time the Elvie bomb appears in the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children paraded along the gateway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant minors discreetly displaced to a camp on the Texas border
The number of immigrant minors in detention has increased considerably, despite the fact that the monthly influx on the border has virtually remained at its usual levels, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration are making it difficult for these children to be given birth.
Traditionally, most godfathers, who were also undocumented immigrants in their time, feared that the fact of proposing to welcome a child would endanger their own stay in the country.
This risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential godparents and other adult members of their families should present their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration government entities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior post of the Office of Immigration and Customs, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to house unaccompanied minors.
The agency confirmed after 70 per cent of those arrested had no criminal record.
"About 80 per cent of sponsors or their family members are found in the country illegally, and a large part of them are criminal immigrants.
Therefore, we continue to pursue these people," Albence said.
In their efforts to prosecute children more quickly, staff members have introduced new rules that will require that some of them be brought before the court within a maximum of one month from the time of detention, instead of 60 days, which was the previous rule, according to the workers in the reception centres.
Many of them will testify by videoconferencing, instead of in person, to defend their legal status before a judge for immigration matters.
Those who are not considered fit for protection shall be deported as soon as possible.
According to the workers in the reception centres and the reports of the system that have emerged in recent months, the longer they remain in custody, the greater the likelihood of anxiety or depression, which could lead to violent kidnappings or attempts to flee.
According to defenders, these concerns increase even more in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where it is more likely that, due to its size, the signs of discomfort in these children are ignored.
In addition, the transfer to the camp without having given them enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends could cause them a trauma that many are already suffering.
Syria calls on the "forces of occupation" of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked Syrian refugees to return to their homes, even though the country's war was in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces were illegally in Syrian territory under the pretext of the fight against terrorism and that the subject "will be dealt with accordingly".
"You must withdraw immediately and without conditions," he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and several million have been uprooted from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue to "fight in this sacred battle until we purge all Syrian territories" both from terrorist groups and from "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly providing training and advice to Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 ground soldiers in this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem stated that the right conditions were given for them to return and blamed "some Western countries" for "seeming irrational fears" that made refugees decide to stay outside the country.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have already warned that they will not help with the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats claim that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a containment zone in Idlib's last major rebel bastion has created an opportunity to force political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey avoided a large-scale assault on Syrian and Russian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem has made it clear that the agreement had "clear points" and has expressed the hope that military action will focus on the jihadists, including the Nusra Front combatants (linked to Al-Qaeda), who will "be eradicated".
Staffan de Mistura, a UN Special Envoy, hopes to convene shortly the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem established the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, arguing that the work of the panel should be restricted "to review the articles of the current constitution" and warned against any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Trump would win the reelection by 2020, unless, as many liberal spectators will surely expect, a destitution or scandal will prematurely end his presidency.
This would certainly be "the most dramatic end of a presidency ever seen!"
At the moment there are no signs of fatigue in the viewers.
Since 2014, the peak audience rates have doubled to 1.05 million for CNN and have virtually tripled to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in peak time, compared to 1.7 million years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has exceeded the rates of cable channels with 3.5 million viewers for major night news programs.
"It's a strange attraction that we haven't yet come to understand," says Neal Baer, author-producer of "Designed Survivor", an ABC drama series about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack will destroy the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
Remembers a taxi trip he made in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The taxi driver told him he'd vote for Trump.
Why? asked him.
"Because it makes me laugh," it was the answer Scovell received.
Chaos is always rising in the world of entertainment.
Obviously, unlike anything else seen on television, the arguments coming out of Washington could determine the future of the Roe Case against Wade, the possibility that immigrant families could meet or the health of the global economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
However, the information goes beyond the limits when you realize that you've been seeing a panel of experts for six hours discussing the use of the sources of "deep background" that Bob Woodward used for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich leather hunter ("an unmeasured garment of pride," in the words of The Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniels' s scramble descriptions of Trump's anatomy.
As far as I'm concerned, I'll never see Super Mario again in the same way.
"By offering something new every night, it's in part what makes everything look like a reality show," says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", when he talks about the alternating cast of Trump's show and his daily spins on the plot (whether by entering into a fight against the NFL or praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss an episode if you don't want to stay behind.
When I went to talk to Mr. Fleiss this week, he had a sunny 27-degree day on the north coast of Kauai, but he was a refugee inside the house watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not take off the television, not with Brett Kavanaugh ready to face the Senate Judicial Commission and with the future of the Supreme Court hanging from a thread.
"I remember when in those days we made all those crazy programs and people told us that that was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was all a joke, but in the end it turned out they were right."

Foreign money flows in the tighter mid-term elections of the House of Representatives
It is not a surprise the influx of money that is coming to the 17th District of Pennsylvania, thanks to the restructuring of a Congressional district with two candidates seeking re-election for the same seat.
This residential district of Pittsburg, whose structure was recently redesigned, has the Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another candidate for reelection, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th District of Pennsylvania, a district that largely overlaps with the new 17.
The maps were redesigned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts had been manipulated unconstitutionally for Republicans.
The race for the new 17 has sparked a financing contest for the campaigns between the main financial arms of the parties, the National Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name became very familiar in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a special election held in March for the Congress District 18 of Pennsylvania.
That seat had been occupied by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district for 20 points.
The political experts have given Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States considered penalizing El Salvador for its support to China, even though after leaving the country behind
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with a slight rejection by Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and held a hotel in Panama until the partners evicted the Trump Organization's administration team.
Department of State officials decided to return to the heads of US diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "the recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the department's spokesman, in a statement this month.
But it was only decided to punish El Salvador, who had already received aid of about 140 million US dollars 2017 for, among other matters, the control of drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and restrictions on certain visas, would have been very painful for the Central American country and its high rates of unemployment and crime.
As internal meetings progressed, US and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on economic security and prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting held last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to avoid emigration to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior management officials made it clear that their intention was for the conference to continue, ending any consideration of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence plans to speak at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October and which, if diplomatic, is seen as a sign of the importance that the administration has given to the meeting.
The three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new threats or punishments from Washington.
A spokesman for the Bolton White House refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions under the condition of anonymity.
His explanations were corroborated by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke under condition of anonymity.
The Study of History
The next step could be the report by special counsel Robert Mueller on possible obstruction of Trump's justice, which already has considerable evidence in the public registry.
It is thought that Mueller is also leading this investigation to the possibility that the Trump campaign will work in parallel with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Trump will be held accountable to that chamber, just when he prepares to stand before the voters again, and perhaps finally before a jury of his peers.
This is a lot of conditionals, and I do not suggest that Trump's fall is inevitable, nor that of his equivalents in Europe.
We will all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an effect on the duration of the dispute.
In 1938, the German officers were ready to strike Hitler a coup d’état. It was only necessary that the West had resisted him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of butchery that followed.
The course of history revolves around these points of inflection, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are now facing several of these points of inflection.
What will we do if Trump fires Vice-Fiscal General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a good mood since this newspaper reported that last year it had suggested secretly recording the president and speculating about his inability to hold office.
Rosenstein says The Times' explanation is not accurate.
"How will we respond if the new investigation that the F.B.I. has requested about Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if his position is confirmed in the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
In addition to all this, will we vote in the mid-term elections for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, we will meet with a long winter for democracy.
But, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague, I think we will not fail.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once occupied my ambassador's house.
He managed to survive, emigrated to the United States, and, 60 years later, he sent me to light the candles of the Sabbath at the same table adorned with a swastika.
With that inheritance, how am I not going to be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers, optimistic at the meeting against the Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will play Thursday at home against the Rapid Vienna, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, after the impressive draw in Spain against the Villarreal at the beginning of the month, will place them in a strong position to rank in Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented mediocampist Graham Dorrans from achieving his first appearance of the season until the 2 to 2 draw against the Villarreal, but he believes that the Rangers can use that result as a stepping stone for bigger things.
"We managed to get a good point, as the Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old player.
"We started the party believing we could get something and go out with a point.
Maybe we could have won the win at the end, but, in general, the draw was perhaps a fair result.
They were better in the first half, but after the rest we went out and we were the best team.
This Thursday we will have another great European night.
I hope that we can achieve the three points, but it will be a difficult party because they have already achieved a good result in the previous party. But, with all the public supporting us, I am sure that we can make progress and achieve a positive result.
Last year was definitely hard with my injuries and changes at the club itself, but now you can see a general atmosphere that will all go well.
The team is all right, the guys are enjoying a lot and we're having a good workout.
I hope that we will be able to move forward, leave behind last season and achieve success."
Fear of retirement savings is causing some women to lose their sleep
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people talk about this with their family members.
About half of the people who participated in the Nationwide study said they did talk to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their children about this.
"People want a relative to take care of them, but they're not taking the steps to have this conversation," says Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationwide Life Insurance Company.
This is the way to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: you will not be able to prepare your family for care if you do not express your wishes in advance.
I work with your advisor and your family to talk about where and how to receive attention, as these options can be a determining factor in cost.
Incorporates in the conversion to your financial advisor, as it can also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Your long-term care funding options may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash-value hybrid life insurance policy to help you cover expenses or secure yourself with your own savings, provided you have the money.
Negotiate your legal documents: forward to legal battles.
Take charge of obtaining a medical care power to appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals meet their own wishes if they cannot communicate.
It can also prepare a notary power for its finances.
Select a trusted person to make financial decisions on their behalf and make sure that their invoices are paid if they are disabled.
Do not forget the small details: imagine that your old father has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer the questions about drugs and allergies?
Describe all these details in a written plan so that you are always ready.
"It's not just finance that's at stake: which doctors should we deal with?" Martin asks.

They shoot a man several times with a carbine in Ilfracombe
They fired several times at a man with a carbine as he was walking home after going out at night.
The victim, a 40-year-old man, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe (Devon) when he was shot in the chest, abdomen, and hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 (British time), as a "random act".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
His injuries were not deadly and the police appealed to possible witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died due to a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu last Friday, the authorities said. It is expected that the number of deaths will increase.
With the blocked communications, aid officials have been unable to obtain any information from the Donggala Regencia, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here you can see some important details about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi Central, which is at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a region that stretches over more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The regency, which is a hierarchically inferior administrative region to the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of the Sulawesi Central province, especially in the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but are mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck west Donggala in 1996, with nine fatalities.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Fire Belt, an area of great seismic activity, and often suffers earthquakes.
Here are some of the main earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A large earthquake on the western coast of the province of Aceh, Indonesia, in northern Sumatra, caused on 26 December a tsunami that affected 14 countries and took the lives of 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast. More than half of the victims occurred in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
There were hundreds of fatalities on the island of Nias, opposite the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of magnitude 6.8 hit the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that affected the south coast, with nearly 700 fatalities.
2009: An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake of magnitude 7.5 struck one of the Mintawai islands, near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck Pidie Jaya's reign in Aceh, causing destruction and panic by recalling the devastation of the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time it did not cause any tsunamis, but the collapse of buildings caused the death of more than 100 people.
2018: The tourist island of Lombok (Indonesia) had a series of large earthquakes that resulted in the death of more than 500 people, most of them on the north side of the island.
The earthquake devastated thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily evicted.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice President Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assault charges.
Palin, 29, and a citizen of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to the report published on Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to that police report, when a well-known one of her tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took off his phone.
Palin has been sentenced to pretrial detention at Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is held with an unsecured bail of $500, KTUU reported.
He was presented to the court on Saturday, where he declared himself "definitively innocent" when asked for his statement, he reported the chain.
Palin faces three minor Class A offences, which means he could spend up to a year in prison and receive a fine of $250,000.
He has also been charged with a minor offence of Class B, with a one-day sentence in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges are brought against Palin.
In December 2017, Todd Palin was accused of assaulting his father.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic aggression, of interfering in the complaint of a crime of domestic violence and of possessing a weapon in a state of drunkenness, in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend had claimed to punch him in the face.
Several veteran groups criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking her child's violent behavior with post-traumatic stress disorder resulting from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of fatalities
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi last Friday.
The magnitude of an earthquake of 7.5 caused a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have fallen and the figure of deaths is expected to rise over the next few days.
The earthquake occurred right next to the center of Sulawesi, located in northeastern Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
There are several videos circulating on social networks and showing the time of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami arrived at the coast.
Federal prosecutors exceptionally seek the death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York City
New York federal prosecutors are seeking capital punishment for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people, an exceptional punishment that has not been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, allegedly used a home depot rental truck to carry out last October an attack on a bike lane on the West Side Highway of Lower Manhattan, knocking down the pedestrians and cyclists he found on his way.
To justify a death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious bodily harm, according to the notice of intent to request a death penalty, presented in the South District of New York.
Both charges carry a possible death penalty, according to the court document.
Several weeks after the attack, a large federal jury presented to Saipov an indictment of 22 charges that included eight counts of murder with the help of organized crime, which usually use federal prosecutors in these cases, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and premeditation," according to prosecutors, which described how Saipov carried out it as "atrocious, cruel and depraved."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", is specified in the notice of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since New York South District last processed a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of murdering two drug traffickers, but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed in a federal case in New York went to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in 1953. This marriage was executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The two Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan, demonstrated his lack of remorse during the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the prosecution, Saipov told the authorities that for his attack he was inspired by watching videos of ISIS on his phone.
He also requested that the flag of ISIS be lifted in his hospital room, said the police.
He has been found not guilty of the indictment of 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal defence counsel representing Saipov, said they are "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a conviction with a life sentence without the possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved," Patton said.
The Saipov defence team had previously requested prosecutors not to apply for the death penalty.
Mr Tory said that NIGEL FARAGE should deal with the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the popular army" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former leader of UKIP said that politicians had to "feel the heat" of Eurosceptics, while one of the Members of Theresa May suggested that he should deal with negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said in Birmingham's concentration that the United Kingdom "would have already left" if Farage had been Brexit's Secretary.
But the challenge faced by Prime Minister May to reconcile his divided ranks has further highlighted when a Tories group in favor of permanence has joined in a protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to keep up the commitment plan signed in Chequers in the midst of the favorable attacks on Brexit, its opponents and the EU.
The allies insisted that they will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the violent reaction, and will force the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between its package and the "chaos".
Deputy Bone said in the Leave Means Leave concentration in Solihull that he wanted to reject Chequers' plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been given a position with responsibility in the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he'd been in charge, we'd already be out," he said.
This Member of Parliament for Wellingborough added: "I'm going to defend Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers."
In his statement of opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in world wars to be servile.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone dismissed the suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their mind and we want to remain in the European Union is completely false."
Tory pro-Brexit Andrea Jenkyns was also at the rally, where she told reporters, "I'm just saying one thing: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The general public does not like Chequers' plan, the opposition is not going to vote for and is not popular between our party and our activists, who are actually going out into the streets and voting first.
Forget Chequers and start listening."
In a message addressed to May, he added: Prime Ministers hold their posts when they fulfill their promises."
Farage told the concentrates that it would be necessary to "feel the heat" to politicians if they saw that they were going to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and today we're here to tell them we won't let them get away with it."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.
"We are going to mobilize the popular army of this country that gave us the victory with Brexit and we will never rest until we have become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the permanence-promoting people traveled the streets of Birmingham before the two-hour rally in the city centre.
Some activists waved banners from Tories Against Brexit after the group was presented this weekend.
Labourman Lord Adonis mocked conservatives for the security problems they had with a party application during the opening of the conference.
"These are the same people who tell us that they can implement the computer systems and all technology for Canada Plus, for the borders in harmony, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a total sham.
There is nothing that can be considered a good Brexit," he added.
Warren considers all possibilities of presenting for the presidency
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that she will "consider all possibilities for running for the presidency" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future at a municipal meeting on Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a regular criticism of President Donald Trump, will be presented to the November re-election against Geoff Diehl, the republican state representative, who was co-chair of the Trump Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
There has been considerable speculation about the possibility that Warren will face Trump by 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event at Holyoke was its thirty-sixth meeting with voters using the municipal format since Trump took office.
An assistant asked him if he was planning to present himself for the presidency.
Warren replied that the time has come for "women to go to Washington to fix our irregular government, and that includes a woman on top."
One arrested for gunshot murder by LSU Sims player
Baton Rouge police (Luisiana) announced this Saturday that a suspect has been arrested for shooting down Wayde Sims, the LSU basketball player, last Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m.
They had published a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help to identify a man seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and shot near Southern University campus at the first hour of Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head that eventually caused his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday for 247sports.
Wayde went to defend a friend and got shot by Simpson.
During the interrogation, Simpson admitted to having been at the scene of the crime, in possession of a weapon and having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and arrested at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 1,98-meter-high player from Baton Rouge, played in 32 games last season, holding 10 of them, and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per match.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after the team's orders gave him victory over Sebastian Vettel
Since Valtteri Bottas was ranked in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the orders of the Mercedes team would play an important role in the race.
From the pole, Bottas had a good start and almost threw Hamilton to forget about defending his position on the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to go into boxing and let Hamilton run in the tail of the group, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes came out with force a lap later and got behind Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after an action with the almost-stick wheels that made the Ferrari driver have to leave badly the inside free at risk of resisting after a double move to defend himself in the third curve.
Max Verstappen, who was 21 that day, began from the last row of the grill and was placed in the seventh square at the end of the first lap.
He then led a large part of the race while clinging to his tires to achieve a quick end and overcome Kimi Raikkonen for fourth position.
Finally, he went into boxes in turn 44, but could not increase his pace in the remaining eight laps by recovering Raikkonen's fourth position.
It's been a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman by letting me through.
The team has done an exceptional job to get a perfect match," Hamilton said.
That was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a Saturday meeting because of her insistence that she did not filter Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which she accused Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault, the nominee for the Supreme Court.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention the testimony offered by Ford to the Senate Judicial Committee, but he commented that what happened in the Senate showed that there are people who are "bad, repulsive, and false."
"The only thing that could happen and the good that is happening these last days in the Senate, is when you see anger, when you see people who are evil, disgusting and false," he said.
"When you read the publications and the leaks, and then they say, "But if I didn't.
I didn't."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember his answer... did you filter the document?
Oh, no.
I didn't filter it."
Well, wait a minute.
No, we didn't filter it," he added as he imitated the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh by Ford in July and filtered in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leaking came from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't leak his story," Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep him confidential and, therefore, so I did."
But his refusal did not seem to sit well with the president, who at the Saturday night's rally commented: "I'll tell you one thing: that was a really bad body language."
Maybe he didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing his defence to the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused of improper sexual conduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power by any means possible.
You see wickedness and revulsion, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control," said the president, Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against the Dundee
The Dundee Stars repaired the defeat on Friday at the Elite League in front of the Belfast Giants by winning the match back on Saturday for 5-3 in Dundee.
The Giants achieved an initial advantage of two goals thanks to the attacks of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie got the local tie before Dwyer restored the Giants leadership.
Francois Bouchard evened for Dundee before the two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured his victory.
This has been the third defeat of the season at the Elite League for the men of Adam Keefe, who had just won the Dundee for 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth match of the season between the two teams, of which the Giants won the three previous matches.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute (3:35) thanks to Kendall McFaull's assistance, while David Rutherford provided assistance to Beauvillier to double the lead four minutes later.
In what can be considered a very lively initial period, Sullivan again put the local team eager to play in the minute 13:10 before Matt Marquardt attended Cownie to match the match in the minute 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took advantage before the first break when he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first part.
The local team regrouped and Bouchard once again matched the match with a gorge in the minute 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the match when the end of the second part arrived and the victory was secured with the fifth goal of his team as the final came near.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five matches, play at home in front of Milton Keynes in their next match on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies so that hundreds of people can escape on the plane of the earthquake
An air traffic controller from Indonesia is being hailed as a hero after he died after making sure that a plane carrying hundreds of people could safely take off.
More than 800 people died and many disappeared after a large-scale earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
The strong replicas continue to hit the area and many are trapped among the rubble in the city of Palu.
Although his companions fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu airport. This tower was being hit by a strong swing.
It remained firm to ensure that Batik Air flight 6321, which was on the track at that time, could safely take off.
Then he jumped out of the traffic control tower when he thought it was falling.
He died later in the hospital.
The spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Syrait, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reported Australian ABC News channel.
We had prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"Our hearts are broken by listening to this," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the figure of the dead can reach several thousand people. The national disaster mitigation agency claims that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that the number of victims will continue to increase, as there are still many bodies under the ruins and it has not been able to contact many people," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the agency, told us.
Waves that reached up to six metres have devastated Palu, which will hold a massive burial on Sunday.
Aid and supplies are being brought into military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance arrives with more bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-markets are being looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help the survivors as much as possible, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already in itself a tragedy, but it could have been much worse."
Indonesia's president, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's army: "I ask everyone to work day and night to complete all the evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia had already been hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Aerial accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says a man has disappeared after the air crash in a lagoon
The airline, which operates a flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now says a man has disappeared after saying that the 47 passengers and crew had evacuated the sinking aircraft safely and safely.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon you could not notice a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for further details on the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats were used to help rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
The authorities said on Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and that they were all in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had crossed the airstrip.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane arrived very low.
"That's something extremely good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes comments that he and other travelers were able to move forward through a water that reached their waists to the emergency exits of the plane that was beginning to sink.
He said the flight attendants panicked and shouted, and he suffered a slight injury to the head.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors who were working near a dock improvement work also helped in the rescue using an inflatable boat to transport people to land before the plane sank about 30 meters (100 feet) underwater.
Aviation safety network data indicate that 111 people have died in accidents at registered airlines in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but none with Air Niugini.
An analyst presents the chronology of the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution completed the presentation of its arguments on Saturday in the new trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He exposed to the jury the way he used mobile phone records to chain the movements of Quinton Tellis, the 29-year-old accused, and Jessica Chambers, the 19-year-old victim, the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night of his death, thus contradicting his previous statements, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone had been with Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went up to the stand on Saturday and testified that he had not been in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford said he was "mining, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had known Chambers about two weeks before his death.
Mobile records indicated that they were only known a week earlier.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis removed the messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"The blur of his life," Hale said.
The defence is scheduled to begin its final allegations on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to remain in the hands of the jury on the same day.
The High Breed: What is the conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to fill your music with positive messages to challenge the negative image of the genre.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that the hip hop has departed from its origins from political messages and from dealing with social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make the conscious hip hop popular again.
Interpreters like The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
A New York babysitter demands a couple to fire her after a "racist" text.
A New York babysitter will sue a couple for discriminatory dismissal after mistakenly receiving a text message from her mother complaining that she was "another black person."
The couple denies that he is racist and compares the demand with an "extortion" case.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed her dismay at discovering that the new child caregiver, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived on her first day of work in 2016.
"NoOOOOOOOOOOOO OTHER NEGRA PERSON," wrote Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending him to his husband, he was sent to Maurice twice.
After realizing her leg-measuring, a "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman dismissed Maurice claiming that his former African-American babysitter had done a nasty job and instead waited for a Filipino, as stated in the New York Post.
Maurice received the pay for a day's work and was sent home to Uber.
Maurice is now demanding the couple for compensation for dismissal with the intention of receiving a compensation of $350 per day for the six-month internal position for which he had been hired, albeit without a contract.
"I want to show you that things aren't done that way," he told The Post on Friday and added that "I know it's a case of discrimination."
The couple responded to the claims that they are racists saying that the end of Maurice's employment was most reasonable, because they feared they could not trust her after she had offended her.
"My wife had sent him something I didn't mean.
She's not racist.
We are not racists," said husband Joel Plasco at the Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you've been rude to, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn?
Come on!"
Comparing the demand as an "extortion," Plasco said that his wife had given birth to the baby two months earlier and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Are you going to go get someone like that?
That's not that it's a very decent thing," the investment banker added.
Although the legal case is still ongoing, the public opinion court has been in a hurry to denounce the partner on social networks, criticizing them for their behaviour and logic.
Paddington's editors feared that readers would not identify with a talking bear, reveal a new letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said on the letter: "It was difficult to get into the place of someone who read it for the first time before its publication.
It's so nice to know now what we know about Paddington's great success."
After saying that his father, who had worked as a BBC camera before was inspired by a toy bear to write the book for children, trusted that his work would be rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the book publication was something "greasy" after his death last year.
From Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family," she added that her father was very proud of his final success.
"He was a very quiet man and he didn't like to brag," he said.
"But as Paddington had been so real to him, it was almost as if you had a son who achieves something important: you are proud of him, even if it is not really your merit.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and product of his imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
Upon landing, her daughter was urgently transferred to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad regularly called to say that the situation was really bad, that he was not expected to achieve it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got Nad's call to tell me he was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And so I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that the doctors had given him to keep the pumping from his heart were slowly running out and leaving his system.
She had died before and everything was going off.
I could only sit there and wait, knowing all this was happening.
I couldn't get up, scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I really had to stay firm."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now suffering from the loss of her daughter, embarked on the plane with the other passengers, outside the terrible experience that was going on.
"No one knew," he said.
"I held my head and my tears fell all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was on the flight where I felt this overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
That I needed all my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved her."
Women in mourning put cards to avoid suicide is a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones because of suicides are working to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call to ask for help.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want no father to feel what I feel every day," he said.
Davis, 45 years old and living in Lydney, said his son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said their smile lit up anywhere."
However, he left work before he died, as he was "in a really dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found him after he had taken his life.
Mrs Davis said, "I am constantly concerned that it may have repercussions."
Davis created the cards "so that people know that there are people you can come to and who you can talk to, even if he's a friend.
You don't feel quiet, you have to talk about it."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been Davies' friend for years, lost Mark, her partner with whom she was 15 years old, shortly after her mother died.
"He didn't say he felt depressed or anything like that," he says.
"A couple of days before Christmas we noticed your change of attitude.
Christmas day came to its lowest point: when the children opened their gifts, he didn't even look at them."
He said his death was a great trauma to them, but they have to overcome it: "Leave a vacuum in the whole family.
He's left us torn apart.
But we all have to keep fighting."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs on a thread at the moment the FBI starts the investigation
"I thought that if we could really get something like what I was asking for (a limited research in time, of limited scope), maybe we could bring some unity," said Mr.Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee would be "going a pique" in the midst of a partisan paralyzing.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI's investigation to take place?
Its refusal is entirely due to chronology.
Only five weeks remain for mid-term elections on 6 November. If, as expected, Republicans have poor results, their attempts to achieve the election of the man they want for the highest court in the country will be severely weakened.
George W. Bush has been calling the senators, pressing them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House. Thanks to Bush, Kavanaugh met his wife Ashley, who was the personal secretary of the President.
What happens once the FBI publishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh will be able to obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm it for the Supreme Court.
North Korea's deserters' figures "caen" with Kim
The number of deserters from North Korea to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, said a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Southern Unity, said that last year there were 1,127 deserts, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the most stringent border controls between North Korea and China, and the high rates charged by human traffickers have been the key factors.
Pyongyang has made no public comment on this.
The vast majority of Northern deserters are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
The majority flees through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and which is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ).
China believes that deserters are illegal immigrants rather than refugees and are often repatriated.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Early in the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks that focused on denuclearization negotiations.
This took place after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, who generally agreed to work on a nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress.
"Without US confidence, there will be no confidence in our national security and under these circumstances we will in no way be the first to disarm unilaterally," Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "histeric" and says he is not fit to serve in the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the minority of the House of Representatives, said that the nominee for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh was a "historic" and that he was not fit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Austin Festival (Texas).
"I can't help thinking that if a woman had acted that way, they would have said she's a hysterical," Pelosi said about her reaction to the testimony that Kavanaugh gave on Thursday to the Senate Judicial Committee.
Kavanaugh used the emotion to deny the accusations that she had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes almost shouting and enticing himself as he spoke of his family and his years of secondary education.
In the committee, he also explicitly condemned the Democrats , rating the accusations against them as "grotesque and clearly coordinated defamations" organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelosi said that, in his opinion, Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, because he showed his bias against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with those statements with and the way he has persecuted the Clintons and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi raised his objections when he was asked whether he would challenge Kavanaugh in the event that he was confirmed in office and that the Democrats obtained the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll just say one thing: if you're not telling Congress or the FBI the truth, you won't be fit not just to be in the Supreme Court, you won't even be able to be in the court you're now in," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Washington Circuit Court of Appeal D.C.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he was concerned about the possible rulings of Kavanaugh against the Affordable Health Care Act or the Roe Case against Wade, as it is considered to be a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would nullify certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is not the time for a hysterical and impartial person to go to court and wait for us to find that everything is all right," Pelosi said.
And women have to push it.
It's a justified diatribe, it's months and years of fury overflowing, and she can't let go without crying.
"We cried when we got angry," said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think that's that weird, do you?"
He continued by saying, "I was very helped by a woman who was an executive in some company and told me that she was crying too when she was angry, but who had developed a technique by which when she was angry and started crying, she told the person she was talking to, "Maybe you think I'm sad because I'm crying.
Well, no, I'm angry."
And then he went on with what he was doing.
I thought it was great."
Tears are allowed as a way out for anger in part because they are basically not understood well.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs, in an office dominated by men, was once I found myself weeping with an inexpressible rage. An older woman, a serious manager of whom I had always had a slight fear, grabbed me by the crucible and dragged me to a stairwell.
"Don't let them never see you cry," she said.
"They have no idea you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they think they've cornered you."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential careers.
In 1987, when they caught Hart on an extramarital adventure aboard a ship called Monkey Business, where she had to retire from the presidential race, Schroeder, deeply frustrated, was found to have no reason to explore the idea that she herself would come forward for the presidency.
"It wasn't a well-premeditated decision," he told me in laughs 30 years later.
"There were already seven candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was one more candidate.
Someone referred to us as Snow White and the seven dwarfs."
As the campaign was already very advanced, it was left behind in fund-raising, so it was promised that it would not re-enter the race unless it raised two million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
He discovered that some of his supporters who gave $1,000 to men, only gave her $250.
"Do you think I have a discount?" he asked.
When he gave his speech to announce that he would not have a formal campaign, he was so overwhelmed by the emotions (gratitude for the people who had supported it, frustration for a system that made it difficult to raise funds and focused on the capture of voters instead of delegates, and anger at sexism) that he was taken in.
"It would have been logical to think that he had had a nervous crisis," Schroeder said recalling the reaction of the press.
"You might have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my tombstone?
"He cried?"
The trade war between the United States and China could benefit Beijing
The first saves from the trade war between the United States and China were deafening, and although there is still much left to end the battle, a break between countries could benefit Beijing, experts think.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, launched the first warning earlier this year by putting tariffs on major Chinese exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new tariffs that affect 200,000 million dollars (150,000 million pounds sterling) in products, which charges half of the products entering the United States from China.
On all occasions, Beijing has taken equivalent reprisals, recently applying five to ten percent tariffs to US products worth $60 billion.
China has committed itself to equalizing US attacks, and it is unlikely that the second most powerful economy in the world will soon loosen.
Getting Washington back would mean yielding to the demands, but publicly submitting to the United States would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Even so, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of the U.S. trade war could positively help China in the long run by reducing interdependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can make the conditions to start a sting fall of the economy in either country is actually far more dangerous than the viewers have recognized so far," said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher focused on Asian issues for the strategic cabinet Center for New American Security.
Syria is ready to return refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria claims that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild a country devastated by a war that has been over seven years old.
In a speech earlier by the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the conditions of the country were improving.
"The situation on the ground is now more stable and secure thanks to the progress that has been made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to try to restore normality.
All conditions for the voluntary return to the country of refugees have already been established that had to abandon it because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that, since the war began in 2011, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country.
There are another six million people who still live in the country and need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem acknowledged that the Syrian regime would appreciate the help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he also stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from the countries that promoted the insurgency.
Europe is made with the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the US team with a final score from 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National, outside Paris (France).
The United States now has six consecutive defeats on European soil since the last time it won a Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe regained its crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight for most of the tournament, launched his point of exit to the water in hole 16 pair 3, thus admitting his defeat before Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari highlighted in all rounds, becoming one of the four players who have never achieved a 5-0-0 since the beginning of the current tournament format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth fell defeated by 5 and 4 in front of the player with the lowest ranking of the European team, the Danish Thorbjorn Olesen.
The world's number one player, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to English Ian Poulter, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
Spanish Sergio García, a veteran who already carries eight Ryder Cups, became the European with more victories of the tournament of all time, with 25.5 points in his career.
"I'm not going to cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
I am totally grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very, very happy I could have recovered the drink.
It is an achievement of the whole team and I am very glad that I could have helped," said a excited Garcia after the victory of the European team.
Now passes the torch to his countryman John Rahm, who already defeated the legend of the US golf Tiger Woods on Sunday for 2 and 1 in an individual game.
"I feel incredible pride in having defeated Tiger Woods, as I grew up seeing this man," said the 23-year-old golfer John Rahm.
Woods lost the four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in his race at the Ryder Cup.
This is a strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, who has won 14 great titles, remaining only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had to fight all weekend to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a high-level golf course throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's disappointing performance: "I'm very proud of these guys, they've never stopped fighting.
There was a moment this morning when we heated the situation in Europe.
But we lost him.
I want to congratulate Thomas.
He's a great captain.
His 12 players have made a very good game.
We'll regroup, meet with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and move on.
I love these 12 guys a lot and I'm proud to be your captain.
Now it's our turn to tilt our heads.
We've been over it."
